# Introduction

## History of chemokines

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of  both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 [@yoshimura_1987]. <!-- Chemokines are important regulators of, which largely explains how they contribute to controlling inflammatory processes in the brain.-->
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) [@meucci_1998]. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? <!--The plausible explanation is that they may provide a bridge between the immune and nervous systems, which are classically viewed as two complex and distinct entities.///  Since then, numerous detailed studies on the crucial role of these immune proteins and their receptors in the brain have been published.-->
Chemokines control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system [@williams_2014].
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions (see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)).
These results suggest their brain-specific functions, such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. <!--suggests a role for such molecules in mediating homeostatic cross-talk between cells of the brain parenchyma ( Williams et al., 2014 ). /// Like neurotransmitters, the chemokine system is widely but unevenly distributed in the brain and has both ligands and receptors expressed in neurons. //// The cross-talk among neurons and glia is determinant to establish and maintain a normal brain function.  -->
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis [@trettel_2020].<!--  but also function as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in the brain [@adler_2005]. --><!-- neurodevelopment? /// During brain development, chemokines represent signaling molecules that drive the correct migration and axonal pathfinding of neuronal progenitor cells ( Tran and Miller, 2003 ):--->


## Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized [@hughes_2018]. 
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet on which a C-terminal `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix is folded (for review:  @miller_2017).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Particularly, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop <!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: @kleist_2016). 
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in one chemokine domain may significantly alter receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction -->

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting "ligand"), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (@zlotnik_2000, see Figure \@ref(fig:family)).
In the CXC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part a), one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues. <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, --> 
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues which are adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:family), part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, see see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.  
The CX3C (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also known as fractalkine), which is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part d). 

(ref:family) *Chemokine families.* Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys – cysteine residue, X – amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines.

```


Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors  and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). 
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains. <!-- lepiej napisać i rysunek? -->
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered important for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins, and is important for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, they are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R”, which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure \@ref(fig:family)). 
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR [@hughes_2018]. <!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... -->
CKRs typically transduce their signals *via* two major routes: G~i~ proteins and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`‐arrestin  [@zweemer_2014].

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives [@bachelerie_2014; @salvi_2017], structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018].  <!-- TROCHĘ ZMIENIĆ PIERWSZĄ CZĘŚĆ ZDANIA BO ZŻYNKA -->
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors, and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation [@bachelerie_2014; @bonecchi_2016; @nibbs_2013]. <!--  In the last few years, the role of ACKRs is gradually clarifying since they were shown to regulate inflammation acting as scavenger receptors, promoting chemokine  transcytosis  or  regulating  chemokine  gradient formation (Mantovani et al., 2001; Nibbs and Graham, 2013; Bachelerie et al., 2014a,b; Bonecchi and Graham, 2016).-->
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role in regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological and pathological contexts (for review: @salvi_2017). 
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS, along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter \@ref(behavior)). <!-- jakoś inaczej to napisać .... -->

<!--The classical, formulated in the mid-1900s, classification divided chemokine receptors into serving inflammatory, homeostatic, and dual actions.
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic. 
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors regarded as homeostatic were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species [@nomiyama_2013], highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases. /// nie wiem czy tutaj, może na razie nigdzie-->

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively. <!--The chemokines that I mainly focus on belong to the two chemokine families; they are the CX3C chemokine CX3CL1 and its cognate receptor, CX3CR1, and the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)) and its receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 (previously known as CXCR7). -->

### CX3CL1/ CX3CR1

CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine $\delta$ family <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.-->
The full-length of this protein (around 95 kDa), consisting of 397 amino acid in human <!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--> and 395 amino acid in mice <!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->, is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acid. <!-- Fractalkine is a unique chemokine in that it exists in two different forms: a membrane-bound protein tethered to neuronal membranes by a mucine-like stalk (approximately 95 kDa), and a soluble factor released upon cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) (Garton et al., 2001). Membrane-bound fractalkine has been proposed to act as an adhesion molecule, whereas the diffusible form works as an extracellular chemoattractant promoting cellular migration. This function is shared with other members of the chemokines family, commonly acting as “chemotactic cytokines” during innate and adaptive immunity. The name “chemokines” is precisely derived from this ability to mediate attraction of their responsive cells (Bazan et al., 1997; Comerford andMcColl, 2011; Pan et al., 2011; Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012).-->
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Together with <!-- add another chemokine-->, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk, and a shorter soluble form realesed upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain [@bajetto_2001 <!--(Garton et al., 2001).-->] *via* the action of several protease.
This enzymes can be a class of metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, and ADAM17 or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) (TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme) in both the periphery and CNS (Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2013). <!--poprawić, -->
<!--The soluble N-terminal chemokine domain, which has approximately 70 kDa, can be released from the transmembrane form *via* the action of several metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, and ADAM17 or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) (TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme) in both the periphery and CNS (Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2013). <!-- poprawić! --> 
Soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and activation of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, whereas membrane bound CX3CL1 acts as an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration (Ransohoff, 2009).<!-- CX3CL1, also named fractalkine, is produced almost exclusively by neurons under phys- iological conditions (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011). It is synthesized as a transmembrane protein, which undergoes a proteolytic cleavage and is afterwards released into the extracellular space as a soluble cytokine, although a chemoattractant role has also been proposed for the membrane-bound form of the protein (Lauro et al., 2006; Song et al., 2013). CX3CR1 is a conventional Gi-protein coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor that is highly expressed by microglia (Paolicelli et al., 2014; Tremblay et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016). - Bolos2018 --> 



CX3CR1 is the G~i~ protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which specifically interacts with both forms of CX3CL1 with the same affinity <!-- check citation [@Imai1997] and (Harrison et al., 2001). The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 is a Gi-protein coupled receptor encoded by the Cx3cr1 gene, previously named V28, located on the chromosome 3 in human (Combadiere et al., 1995) and the chromosome 9 in mouse (Combadiere et al., 1998).  --> 
The subunit G~i~ inhibits the production of cAMP, triggering a variety of intracellular second messengers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NFκB),  (Al-Aoukaty et al., 1998; Chandrasekar et al., 2003). <!-- ZMIENIĆ!!!!

### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3

## Chemokine signaling

The multifaceted role of chemokines in both nervous and immune systems is mirrored by the complexity of the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying their biological functions. 

Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (@hughes_2018, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chem_mol_mechanisms), part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].

Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: @zlotnik_2000, @hughes_2018, Fig. \@ref(fig:chem_mol_mechanisms), part b).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
There is a prevailing notion that in the absence (or blockade) of a particular chemokine or chemokine receptor due to genetic or environmental factors, it could be compensated by the presence of other molecules with similar functions, illustrating the robustness of chemokine signaling.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this chapter.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules [@zweemer_2014]. 

Most chemokine receptors, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers.<!-- homo/hetero/oligomerization // as well as can act as multimeric forms, homo- or heterodimers [248–250]. // Moreover, after interaction with chemokines, some receptors undergo dimerization (heterodimerization, homodimerization) and oligomerization process, which seems to be critical for the triggering of biological responses [@mellado_2001].-->
This phenomenon has also been shown to modify ligand binding properties or activate different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011]. 
Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g. with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs (@kleist_2016).
Moreover, an increasing number of data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), adding another level of complexity.

GAGs, polysaccharides present both at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them.
It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors.
Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression  [@lortatjacob_2009], along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication. 

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors that provides a framework for understanding how a finite set of chemokine ligands generates myriad functionally diverse outcomes (@zweemer_2014, @kleist_2016, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chem_mol_mechanisms), part d).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished.<!-- based on??? -->  
Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin.
Importantly, pathway activation depends on the cellular expression and availability of signaling elements, resulting in cell-specific differences. 
Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which normally binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts. 
Therefore, biased signaling is another mechanism of chemokine signaling contributing to better understanding how chemokine ligands coordinate such diverse and complex multiple cell functions. <!-- może to rozbudować bardziej na zasadzie wcześniejszej wersji manuskryptu-->

Noting the CKRs' diverse cellular distribution and the complexity of chemokine ligand-receptor interactions, it is evident that chemokine receptors may activate different intracellular pathways in a ligand- and cell-specific context (see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chem_mol_mechanisms), part c). 
Chemokine receptors most often signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) ½, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011).

To sum up, the mechanisms mentioned above, together with the dualistic nature of some of the chemokine ligands (e.i. a chemokine agonist at one receptor can antagonize another receptor) and the presence of non-chemokine ligands ( e.g., ubiquitin, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-defensins, @hughes_2018) presents a multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated system with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes. <!-- Studies indicate that chemokines and their receptors interact with each other in a complex manner.  -->

(ref: chem_mol_mechanisms) **Molecular mechanisms of the chemokine system in the CNS.** **a** Post-translational modifications exemplified by CX3CL1 transmembrane form cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases into its soluble variant. **b** The chemokine family redundancy is exemplified by ACKR3, an atypical chemokine receptor, which binds two chemokines, CXCL11 and CXCL12. Besides the ACKR3 receptor, these two chemokines activate other chemokine receptors, namely CXCR3 and CXCR4, respectively. **c** Most chemokine receptors can form homo- and hetero-dimers. It is exemplified by the well-known CXCR4-ACKR3 complex. CXCR4 receptor is a 'classical' chemokine receptor, which activates G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q/i~ signaling pathways, including PKC or (ERK) ½. As an atypical receptor, ACKR3 alone activates `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, leading to receptor internalization or scavenging. However, after heterodimerization with CXCR4, it can modify ligand binding properties and receptor signaling as well as intracellular trafficking. **d** Chemokine bias signalling occurs when specific chemokines could preferentially activate different intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, although binding to the same receptor. It can be due to a specific ligand or receptor, as exemplified here, due to a specific cell. 
As suggested recently [@odemis_2012], when ACKR3 is activated on neurons, it signals through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, but when it is activated on astrocytes, it recruits `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways. 











All chemokines  are  produced  with  a  signal  peptide  at  the  N‐terminal  end,  which  is  removed  before secretion. 
Besides, some present an extended C‐terminus and can bind to the cell surface through a mucin‐like  domain,  which  can  be  cleaved  later  to  release  the  proteins  into  the  extracellular  area (Hughes and Nibbs, 2018). 

Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination, nitration/nitrosylation, or cleavage by proteases [@hughes_2018, @thompson_2017].<!--After chemokine production, these molecules may be chemically modified, which profoundly affects chemokine activity. -->
These changes can lead either to the activation or inactivation of the chemokine, change chemokine affinity for its corresponding receptor, or switch from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].<!-- citation review???

Complicating these levels of regulation is the fact that overall protein synthesis rates are high in the young brain, decline through adulthood, and fall sharply with old age [13], [56]. Protein turnover in the brain appears to follow a similar pattern [13]; however, little is known about the effects of age on other protein modifications. In addition, proteins such as GFAP show increased metabolic turnover with age, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. Our results are consistent with independent regulation of chemokine expression at the mRNA and post-translational levels.

Protein expression and/or production is controlled by gene regulation, mRNA, and protein synthesis, which are considered relatively slow processes. 
As brain cells often need to quickly respond to their quickly changing microenvironment, these mechanisms may not be indispensable for chemokine coordination of homeostatic brain functions. 
Therefore, tight and rapid control of chemokine system signaling is highly required and can be achieved by several chemokine-induced signaling mechanisms.

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now starting to appreciate the extent and complexity of these mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling.

Transport of     chemokines   inside cells occurs     via   the canonical protein trafficking pathway associated with endoplasmic reticulum and   Golgi     [6]  .   Overall  , the secretion of chemokines varies vastly between cell types   and   activation stimuli   and can involve a myriad of secretory pathways, including secretory   granules and vesicles   [2, 5, 6]  . [@watson_2020]


#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 {#cxcl12}

CXCL12, along with their receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, is constitutively expressed in the CNS, both during neurodevelopment and adulthood. 
These molecules are present in nearly all CNS cell types, including endothelial, glial, and notably neuronal cells (see: Fig.2).
They are widely distributed across the CNS.
Specifically, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-localized with many neuropeptides, for example, in  dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) [@guyon_2006].
Additionally, they are often co-expressed with opioid receptors in neurons and astrocytes, frequently forming heterodimers [@burbassi_2010], which implies interactions between those two systems (see Section: \@ref(opio), for review: @mlikparsadaniantz_2015). 
Likewise, recent evidence has begun to implicate ACKR3 in chemokine-opioid interactions,leading to behavioral manifestations (see: \@ref(behavior), @ikeda_2013; @meyrath_2020).

Moreover, ACKR3 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in the same neuronal [@shimizu_2011] and astrocytic populations [@odemis_2010]. 
In neurons, prominent cytoplasmic expression of ACKR3 was demonstrated, whereas CXCR4 was found on the cell membrane [@shimizu_2011], suggesting that ACKR3 may affect CXCR4 trafficking and/or coupling to other proteins [@shimizu_2011].
Consistently, ACKR3 up-regulation was shown to enhance heterodimer formation with CXCR4, which further resulted in its internalization and degeneration [@utokonomi_2013].
As a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 is thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration [@naumann_2010].
However, compelling evidence illustrated that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ levels following the activation of PTX-sensitive G~i/o~ proteins, leading to either proliferation  or  differentiation of astrocytes [@odemis_2010].  
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: @bajetto_2001a), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes, but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor [@odemis_2012].
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G protein signaling pathways in these cells.
It is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist [@burns_2006], resulted in activation of `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting [@odemis_2012].  
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.  
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification. 
Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs  astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Cx43 internalization in a `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2-dependent manner [@fumagalli_2020], whereas CXCR4 leads to NF-K`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` activation with consequent TNF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` and glutamate release from these cells [@bezzi_2001; @cal_2008; @cal_2010].
Therefore, these findings suggest that CXCR4 and CXCR7 may serve distinct functions *via* different signaling pathways in astrocytes.

CXCL14 did not activate CXCR4-expressing cells (i.e.,failed to trigger chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization, as well as signaling *via* ERK1/2<!-- symbol--> and the small GTPase Rac1); however, CXCL14 bound to CXCR4 with high affinity, induced redistribution of cell-surface CXCR4, and enhanced HIV-1 infection by>3-fold. We postulate that CXCL14 is a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4 that enhances the potency of CXCR4 ligands.

the only member of the atypical receptor family that is expressed under physiological conditions is ACKR3, previously known as CXCR7 (@meyrath_2020; @fumagalli_2020; @banisadr_2016; @schnemeier_2008; @gttle_2010, see: Table1, Figure 2C).
Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, ACKR3 is well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013].

 @fumagalli_2020 - ACKR3 (previously called CXCR7) expressed in HEK293T cells recruits the gap junction protein Connexin 43 (Cx43). Cx43 and ACKR3 are co-expressed in mouse brain astrocytes and human glioblastoma cells and form a complex in embryonic mouse brain. Functional in vitro studies show enhanced ACKR3 interaction with Cx43 upon ACKR3 agonist stimulation. Furthermore, ACKR3 activation promotes β-arrestin2- and dynamin-dependent Cx43 internalization to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication in primary astrocytes. These results demonstrate a functional link between ACKR3 and gap junctions that might be of pathophysiological relevance.
 CXCR7 as an example of scavenger receptor that shows biased signaling ? 
CXCR7 is an interesting atypical chemokine receptor (Maksym et al., 2009). 
Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, CXCR7 is conserved well across the vertebrate species including sea lamprey (Nomiyama et al., 2011). 
It binds CXCL11 and CXCL12. 
Importantly, CXCR7 can heterodimerize with CXCR4 and modulate the effect of CXCL12 on CXCR4. 
Furthermore, CXCR7 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways (Maksym et al., 2009). 
During embryogenesis, CXCR7 is necessary for proper migration of primordial germ cells to CXCL12 via CXCR4 by acting as a sink for CXCL12 (Boldajipour et al., 2008). 
CXCR7 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007). 
Although poorly expressed in normal adult tissues, CXCR7 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors and tumor-associated vessels and appears to promote tumor growth and neoangiogenesis partly by signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Maksym et al., 2009). 
However, in the CNS, the role of  ACKRs  seems  to  be  more  complex  than  the  simple  control  of  inflammation. 
are unified by their ability to degrade chemokines. This function has been best characterized for ACKR2   (REFS 11  ,  23–25  )  , which constitutively traffics to and from   the cell surface via endosomes.
Not only GAGs can alter the availability of chemokines, but also chemokine receptors themselves. A certain group of chemokine receptors, known as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) [16] , have been proposed to act mainly as chemokine ligand scavengers [17,18] . Furthermore, under certain circumstances the G protein-coupled chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to become uncoupled from G protein signaling. Therefore, expression of a certain chemokine receptor does not always imply a contribution to the disease state. In fact, one might speculate that a pharmacological blockade of these receptors can increase free chemokine levels and therefore result in enhanced pathology. 

#### CX3CL1/CX3CR1 {#cx3cl1}

CX3CL1, previously known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine<!--delta---> family.
Together with CXCL16 (see the section below: \@ref(cxcl12)), CX3CL1 is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form, which may be released as a shorter soluble form upon proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteases, such as ADAM10 or ADAM17 (for example: @schulte_2007).
CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, are widely distributed in the CNS.
Besides the well-documented neuronal expression of CX3CL1, only a handful of studies revealed its presence in astrocytes, albeit at lower levels (for instance: @sunnemark_2005).
Regarding cellular expression pattern of CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, in the CNS, it remains controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia [@tarozzo_2003; @cardona_2006], whereas several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal,  hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and DRN neurons.

In the  CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, the CX3CR1 receptor   gene   has   been   replaced   by   a   green   fluorescent protein   (GFP)   reporter  [@jung_2000].
Based on CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression, this genetic strain provides the most studied model to investigate the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation.
Thus, this model resulted in an  extensive body of evidence, highlighting the key role of CX3CL1 signaling in regulating a broad spectrum  of aspects of microglia functions, as described respectively in detail in the following sections.
