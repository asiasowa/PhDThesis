# Introduction

## Chemokines 

### Brief history of chemokines {#history}

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of  both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 [@yoshimura_1987]. <!-- Chemokines are important regulators of, which largely explains how they contribute to controlling inflammatory processes in the brain.-->
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) [@meucci_1998]. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? <!--The plausible explanation is that they may provide a bridge between the immune and nervous systems, which are classically viewed as two complex and distinct entities.///  Since then, numerous detailed studies on the crucial role of these immune proteins and their receptors in the brain have been published. //  Most of them are widely expressed during neuroinflammation, but plenty of them are also found during the physiological state or neurodevelopment.-->
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system [@williams_2014].
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions (see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)).
These results suggest their brain-specific functions, such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. <!--suggests a role for such molecules in mediating homeostatic cross-talk between cells of the brain parenchyma ( Williams et al., 2014 ). /// Like neurotransmitters, the chemokine system is widely but unevenly distributed in the brain and has both ligands and receptors expressed in neurons. //// The cross-talk among neurons and glia is determinant to establish and maintain a normal brain function.  -->
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis [@trettel_2020].<!--  but also function as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in the brain [@adler_2005]. --><!-- neurodevelopment? /// During brain development, chemokines represent signaling molecules that drive the correct migration and axonal pathfinding of neuronal progenitor cells ( Tran and Miller, 2003 ):--->


### Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors {#classification}

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized [@hughes_2018]. 
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet on which a C-terminal `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix is folded (for review:  @miller_2017).<!-- a disordered N-terminus , long N-loop, known also as the N loop, a 310-helix and a three-stranded beta-sheet, and finally a C-terminal alpha helix [65]zmienić, (Clark-Lewis et al., 1995; Clore and Gronenborn, 1995). // These studies revealed that despite low sequence homology, chemokines adopt a remarkably conserved tertiary structure consisting of a disordered N terminus of 6–10 amino acids, which functions as a key signaling domain in all chemokines characterized to date. This region is followed by a long loop (the N-loop) that ends in a 310 helix and invariably contains important binding de- terminants, a three-stranded , and a C-terminal helix. Disulfide bonds stabilize the overall topology (Figure 1)/// The N-terminus is followed by a long loop, leading into three antiparallel beta-pleated sheets terminating in an a helix that overlies the sheets (Baggiolini and Loetscher, 2000). --><!--Chemokines are defined by their primary amino acid sequence and the arrangement of specific structurally important cysteine residues within the mature protein. These form disulphide bonds that maintain the structure of the chemokine monomer, which consists of a central three stranded ?-sheet, an overlying C-terminal ?-helix and a short unstructured N-terminus that plays a critical role in receptor activation [1].-->
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Particularly, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop<!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: @kleist_2016). 
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction -->

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting "ligand"), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (@zlotnik_2000, see Figure \@ref(fig:family)).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part a). <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, --> 
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:family), part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.  
The CX3C (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part d). 

(ref:family) *Chemokine families.* Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys – cysteine residue, X – amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines. <!-- Classification of the four families of chemokines and their respective receptors Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in  their sequences. Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa. They are subdivided into four  families (see figure), based on the number and spacing of the conserved cysteine residues in their  amino termini. These families are the CXC, CC, C and CX3C chemokines. Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell-surface receptors that belong to the  superfamily of seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors. Chemokine-receptor  nomenclature follows that of chemokines, and the receptors are thus designated CXCRn, CCRn,  XCRn and CX3CRn.  In CXC (also known as α) chemokines (see figure, part a), one amino acid separates the first two  cysteine residues (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC). Chemokines of this family are known to  chemoattract neutrophils, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. In CC (also known  as β) chemokines (see figure, part b), the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other.  Members of this chemokine family chemoattract monocytes, macrophages, basophils,   T lymphocytes and eosinophils, but have little or no effect on neutrophils. The C (also known as γ)  chemokine subfamily (see figure, part c) is distinguished structurally as containing only two of the  four conserved cysteine residues that are found in the other families. The only members of this family  are lymphotactin   α   and   β   (XCL1 and XCL2), which are known to chemoattract T lymphocytes. These  chemokines are specific ligands for the XCR1 receptor. The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine  subfamily, which is currently represented by a single member named fractalkine (CX3CL1), is  characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well  as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see figure, part d).    -->

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors  and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). <!-- Chemokines belong to a large family of structurally-related chemotactic cytokines that exert their functions upon binding to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (Allen et al., 2007;Proudfoot, 2002;Rossi and Zlotnik, 2000).// Chemokine     receptors     are     commonly     classified     in     CR,     CCR,     CXCR, and     CX3CR     receptors     according     to     the     type     of     chemokine     they bind,     and     are     differentially     expressed     on     different     cell     types   [7]  .-->
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains. <!-- lepiej napisać i rysunek? /// Chemokines bind t o chemokine receptors, which constitute the largest branch of the g subfamily of rhodopsin-like GPCRs, a receptor superfamily, which, in modern pharmacology, is themostsuccessfultargetofsmall molecule inhibitors for treating diseases affecting various organs , including the central nervous, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal system.  -->
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R”, which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure \@ref(fig:family)). 
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR [@hughes_2018].<!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... -->

Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011). <!-- CKRs typically transduce their signals *via* two major routes: G~i~ proteins and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`‐arrestin  [@zweemer_2014].--><!-- All of these receptors are comprised of approximately 350 amino acids and a molecular weight around 40 kDa. The extracellular domain consists of the N-terminus and three extracellular loops that act in concert to bind the chemokine ligand. The intracellular region is composed of three loops and the C-terminus, which also collaborate to transduce the chemokine signal. Based on their amino acid sequences, chemokine receptors belong to the class A rhodopsin-like family. Although similar to other seven-transmembrane receptors, the chemokine receptors share certain structural features, such as the highly conserved DRYLAIV amino acid sequence in the second intracellular loop (13). --><!--As is the case for the chemokines, the receptors can also be grouped into four major families, CR, CCR, CXCR, and CX3CR, which interact with the C, CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokines, respectively (see Fig. \@ref(fig:family)).-->

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives [@bachelerie_2014; @salvi_2017], structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018].  
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors, and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation [@bachelerie_2014; @bonecchi_2016; @nibbs_2013]. <!--  In the last few years, the role of ACKRs is gradually clarifying since they were shown to regulate inflammation acting as scavenger receptors, promoting chemokine  transcytosis  or  regulating  chemokine  gradient formation (Mantovani et al., 2001; Nibbs and Graham, 2013; Bachelerie et al., 2014a,b; Bonecchi and Graham, 2016). /// are unified by their ability to degrade chemokines. //// This function has been best characterized for ACKR2   (REFS 11  ,  23–25  )  , which constitutively traffics to and from   the cell surface via endosomes. /// A certain group of chemokine receptors, known as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) [16] , have been proposed to act mainly as chemokine ligand scavengers [17,18]. Furthermore, under certain circumstances the G protein-coupled chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to become uncoupled from G protein signaling. Therefore, expression of a certain chemokine receptor does not always imply a contribution to the disease state. In fact, one might speculate that a pharmacological blockade of these receptors can increase free chemokine levels and therefore result in enhanced pathology. -->
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: @salvi_2017). 
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS <!--citations-->(see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)), along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter \@ref(behavior)). <!-- jakoś inaczej to napisać .... // However, in the CNS, the role of  ACKRs  seems  to  be  more  complex  than  the  simple  control  of  inflammation. -->

In addition, the classical, formulated in the mid-1900s classification, divided chemokines into inflammatory (or inducible) chemokines, whose expression is upregulated upon inflammation, and homeostatic chemokines, which display constitutive expression.
Several chemokines share both properties and have been called dual-function chemokines [@zlotnik_2012].
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic.
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors that bind homeostatic chemokines were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species [@nomiyama_2013], highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases.

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively, as they are expressed in the brain under non-inflammatory, basal conditions. <!--The chemokines that I mainly focus on belong to the two chemokine families; they are the CX3C chemokine CX3CL1 and its cognate receptor, CX3CR1, and the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (CXCL12)) and its receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 (previously known as ACKR3). -->

#### CX3CL1/ CX3CR1 {#cx3cl1str}

CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` family [@pan_1997]. <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.-->
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997].<!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--><!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids [@zlotnik_2012]. <!-- Fractalkine is a unique chemokine in that it exists in two different forms: a membrane-bound protein tethered to neuronal membranes by a mucine-like stalk (approximately 95 kDa), and a soluble factor released upon cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) (Garton et al., 2001).  This function is shared with other members of the chemokines family, commonly acting as “chemotactic cytokines” during innate and adaptive immunity. The name “chemokines” is precisely derived from this ability to mediate attraction of their responsive cells (Bazan et al., 1997; Comerford andMcColl, 2011; Pan et al., 2011; Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012).-->
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) *via* the action of several proteases [@bajetto_2001a; @schulte_2007]. <!--(for example: @schulte_2007)(Garton et al., 2001).-->
These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17<!--TACE?-->, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS)<!--(TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme)-->, acting both in the periphery and the CNS [@clark_2007; @cook_2010; @garton_2001; @hundhausen_2003; @jones_2013].<!-- CX3CL1 is a trans-membrane chemokine highly expressed by neurons and present in a soluble form upon cleavage by metalloproteases such as ADAM10, 17 ( Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003 ), catepsin-S and γ -secretases ( Clark et al., 2007; Schulte et al., 2007; Fonovic et al., 2013 ). Both trans-membrane and soluble CX3CL1 forms bind a unique receptor CX3CR1, with possible differences in affinity and activity ( Biber et al., 2007 ). --><!-- Another fundamental finding was that upon stimulation, neurons from sensory pathways are able to cleave the membrane-attached CX3CL1 and release the soluble chemokine (Milligan et al. 2004).--><!-- These  findings indicate  that  the  cleavage  of  transmembrane  chemokines  into  their soluble  chemotactic  variants  may  have  an  important  role  in  the regulation of inflammation in human - CX3CL1 --><!-- The post-translational expression of CX3CL1 may be conditioned by the following factors: BBB and BSCB dysfunction, proteolytic cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases, rapid binding to CX3CR1, and penetrating between three compartments including the extracellular space, CSF, and circulating blood [156,197,198]. @poniatowski_2016--><!-- The regulation of the activation and functioning of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis encompasses the control at the level  of transcription and also regulation during post-translational modifications.--><!-- It is thought that this dynamic proteolytic cleavage of CX3CL1 is a response to neurotoxic insult and serves anti-inflammatory functions [@chapman_2000]. These  data  strongly  suggest  that  dynamic proteolytic cleavage of fractalkine from neuronal membranes in response to a neurotoxic insult, and subsequent chemoattraction of reactive immune cells, may represent an early event in the inflammatory response to neuronal injury. - @chapman_2000--><!-- These  data  strongly  suggest  that  dynamic proteolytic cleavage of fractalkine from neuronal membranes in response to a neurotoxic insult, and subsequent chemoattraction of reactive immune cells, may represent an early event in the inflammatory response to neuronal injury. - @chapman_2000-->
While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration [@ransohoff_2009]. <!--  Membrane-bound fractalkine has been proposed to act as an adhesion molecule, whereas the diffusible form works as an extracellular chemoattractant promoting cellular migration. /// It is synthesized as a transmembrane protein, which undergoes a proteolytic cleavage and is afterwards released into the extracellular space as a soluble cytokine, although a chemoattractant role has also been proposed for the membrane-bound form of the protein (Lauro et al., 2006; Song et al., 2013). CX3CR1 is a conventional Gi-protein coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor that is highly expressed by microglia (Paolicelli et al., 2014; Tremblay et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016). - Bolos2018 --> 
Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a G~i~-protein-coupled receptor [@imai_1997].  <!--CX3CR1 is  which specifically interacts with both forms of CX3CL1 with the same affinity.  check citation [@Imai1997] and (Harrison et al., 2001).--><!--This receptor is encoded by the Cx3cr1 gene, previously named V28, located on the chromosome 3 in human (Combadiere et al., 1995) and the chromosome 9 in mouse (Combadiere et al., 1998).  citation and see if necessary? --><!-- Given the central role played by the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in neuron-microglia communication, the CX3CR1 / mouse model has been used extensively to study this cross-talk mechanism ( Lauro et al., 2006; Paolicelli et al., -->

The subunit protein Gi inhibits the production of cAMP, triggering a variety of intracellular second messengers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), which are well-known for mediating a wide range of cellular functions, including apoptosis, proliferation, transcription and migration (Al-Aoukaty et al., 1998; Chandrasekar et al., 2003).-->

#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 {#cxcl12str}

CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily.
In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`,  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B5")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C6")`), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa [@yu_2006]. <!-- The CXCL12 isoforms differentially regulate CXCR4  signaling, which can impact both physiological and pathophysiological consequences.57 Humans express six different isoforms of CXCL12 (α,  β, δ, γ, ε, φ) produced through alternative splicing.60,74-->
The `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one [@yu_2006].
Hence, as used here, the term "CXCL12" refers to the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation. <!--this form is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation and for clarity will be hereafter referred to as CXCL12.  poprawić trochę --> 
It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. <!-- citation i trochę zmienić...-->
However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological  processes [@britton_2021]. <!-- zmienić trochę --> 
CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet held in close apposition to an `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation [@murphy_2007; @wu_2010].<!-- 56; the two most N-terminal residues are essential for activation of  CXCR4.57,58 In particular, Lys1 at the CXCL12 N-terminus forms a strong polar interaction with Glu32 in the CXCR4  extracellular domain; this interaction leads to the movement of TM5 and TM6, facilitating G-protein binding and concomitant intracellular signal transduction.59-->
CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7.
All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013; @nomiyama_2015].
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 [@balabanian_2005]. <!--along with several other endogenous ligands which are not members of chemokine family  (discussed in detail in section viral ligands). including migration inhibitory factor (MIF),7 extracellular ubiquitin,14,15 and  human beta defensins (HBD) 2 and 315 as well as exogenous ligand, including viral macrophage inflammatory protein 2  (vMIP-II)16 and the HIV envelope glycoprotein GP12017///  C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a G protein–coupled  chemokine receptor encoded on chromosome 2 (  1  ) /// The receptor  has a 7-transmembrane structure with 7 helical regions connected  by 6 extramembrane loops (  2  ). --><!-- Inhibition of DPP4 by Diprotin A or Val-Pyr maintains the CXCL12 concentration at the site of ischemic  injury, promoting stem cell migration, and engraftment potential of ischemic tissue.72 Maintaining concentration gradients of CXCL12 by DPP4 inhibition has the potential to  enhance stem cell repopulation in an array of stem cell therapies, recent work looks at its ability to promote hippocampal  neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.73 -->

<!-- High affinity binding to CXCL12 requires the extracellular  N-terminal domain of CXCR4 which must be post-translationally modified by tyrosine sulfation.20 
The αi subunit both inhibits adenylate cyclase, decreasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),  and activating the Ras-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway resulting  in cell cycle entry and proliferation.24 Both Gαi and Gβγ increase flux through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)Akt pathway.25 Akt promotes cell survival via inactivation of the Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein and activation of  mTor26,27 and through GSK-3 inactivation (thus preventing cyclin D1 degradation and promoting G1-S phase cell cycle  progression28) increases NF-kB-associated gene transcription and also stabilizes β-catenin which increases the transcription of genes linked to cell proliferation.CXCR4 also binds to Gα12/13 and Gαq29 with both interactions promoting CXCL12-induced chemotaxis.

It is not known which ligands bias Gα12/13 and Gαq above the canonical Gαi activation.β-arrestin engagement with CXCR4 can be similarly intricate; distinct receptor conformations differentially drive  signal induction, desensitization, and endocytosis. Structural  studies reveal two distinct conformations: one in which β-arrestin docks with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of  CXCR4 and a second in which β-arrestin is also coupled to the  core transmembrane region. Studies using CXCR4 mutants  reveal that association of β-arrestin with the phosphorylated  GPCR C-terminal tail drives β-arrestin signaling and receptor internalization though not desensitization.

<!-- cxcr4 antagonist: In general, 4 major  classes of CXCR4 antagonists and agonists can be distinguished:  nonpeptide CXCR4 antagonists, such as the bicyclam derivative  AMD3100; small-peptide CXCR4 antagonists, such as T140 and  even smaller cyclic peptides; antibodies to CXCR4; and modified  agonists and antagonists for CXCL12 (  12  ).   The bicyclam derivative AMD3100  (plerixafor injection; Mozobil  [Sanofi]), previously called JM3100, acts as a specific antagonist by  blocking the binding pocket of CXCR4 (  13,14  ). The first clinical  trials with AMD3100 were designe  d for the treatment of HIV. In-  terestingly, an increased amount of white blood cells was observed in  healthy volunteers in phase 1 clinical trials (  15  ). This finding led to  the discovery that AMD3100 mobilizes CD34  1  human hematopoi-  etic stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow to peripheral  blood (  16  ). Finally, AMD3100 was approved by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration as a mobilizer of hematopoietic CD34  1  cells  from the bone marrow to the circulation (  17,18  ). Orally available  CXCR4 antagonists include AMD070 (  19,20  ).  ACKR3 (@meyrath_2020; @fumagalli_2020; @banisadr_2016; @schnemeier_2008; @gttle_2010, see: Table1, Figure 2C). -->


Similar to the other ACKRs, ACKR3 contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs<!--see figure...-->, which is thought to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation [@thelen_2008].<!-- This is partly because of either modification or lack of the typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV) known to be important for efficient coupling with the G~$\alpha$i~ class G-proteins. ///  This motif represents a highly conserved region within the second intracellular loop of GPCRs and is assumed to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation. Indeed, several established atypical chemokine receptors such as D6, DARC, and CCXCKR either lack the DRYLAIV motif or exhibit a modified motif (Graham, 2009). However, other chemokine receptors such as lymphotactin receptors and CXCR6, also showing modifications of the DRYLAIV motif, still signal through G proteins (Thelen and Thelen, 2008).These discrepancies are currently regarded as an indication that at least in case of some GPCRs the DRYLAIV motif is  not sufficient for  G protein  coupling and requires  additional  sequences  (Thelen  and  Thelen, 2008). Consequently, modifications  of  the DRYLAIV motif, as exhibited by ACKR3, may not per se represent a reliable indicator for the lack of G protein coupling.--><!--Furthermore, ACKR3 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways.-->
Like other atypical receptors, ACKR3 was demonstrated to: (i) fail to activate G proteins and subsequent Ca^2+^-induced chemotaxis [@burns_2006; @levoye_2009; @rajagopal_2010a], (ii)  sequester CXCL12 extracellular gradient and thus control CXCR4-mediated cell migration ///by sequestering extracellular CXCL12 and, hence, shaping the extracellular chemokine  gradient  (Boldajipour  et  al.,  2008). More recently, this scavenger function was additionally highlighted by the demonstration of a constant cycling of ACKR3 between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as well as a nonsaturating binding of CXCL12 to ACKR3 (Naumann et al., 2010). Intriguingly, despite this atypical function, ACKR3 induces cell signaling in various types of tumor cells and controls their growth,  adhesion,  and  transendothelial  migration (Burns et al., 2006; Grymula et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Zabel et al., 2009). -->
Interestingly, .... 

Moreover, unlike rest of atypical receptors, ACKR3 was initially thought to only bind CXCL12 and CXCL11 (formerly known as interferon-inducible T-cell a chemoattractant, I-TAC) [@burns_2006].
However, recent study demonstrated its broad-spectrum selectivity for opioid peptides [@meyrath_2020], indicating .... <!-- wcześniej: Moreover, ACKR3 not only binds CXCL11 (formerly known as interferon-inducible T-cell a chemoattractant, I-TAC) as a second chemokine ligand [@burns_2006] ... as described later in this chapter (see Section \@ref(cxcl12sigal)).// contrary to the rest of atypical receptors, ACKR3 binds only to two ligand ///ACKR3,by analogy to its classification in the ACKRs subfamily, owes its designation as atypical to the characteristics that distinguish it from any other opioid peptide receptor. These include its inability to induce G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, its continuous recycling after opioid peptide binding and efficient ligand depletion from extracellular space, but also its broad-spectrum selectivity for opioid peptides, in the nanomolar range, and its unresponsiveness to alkaloid opioids and synthetic opioid drugs.[@meyrath_2020] /// Similarly to the classical opioid receptors, ACKR3 is highly conserved among species and through the evolution indicating important functions.

As chemokines constitute a complex system, besides their function and signaling pathways are modulated *via* broad array of factors, which are discussed below, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.

### Chemokine signaling {#chemokinesignaling}

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now beginning to appreciate the extent and complexity of the mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling (see for reviews: @eiger_2021; @hughes_2018; @zweemer_2014). <!-- The multifaceted role of chemokines in both nervous and immune systems is mirrored by the complexity of the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying their biological functions. bardziej podsumowanie...-->
They enable tight and rapid control of chemokine signaling and a quick response by the chemokine system to the dynamic microenvironment.
These processes include (1) redundancy, (2) post-translational modifications,  (3) dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, (4) atypical chemokine receptors, (5) dimerization, (6) interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and (7) biased-signaling. <!-- ominięte (4)  diversity in signaling pathways after chemokine activation, -->

#### Redundancy {#redundancy}

The most characteristic aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: @zlotnik_2000, @hughes_2018, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part b and Fig. \@ref(fig:chemoexpression)).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
There is a prevailing notion that in the absence (or blockade) of a particular chemokine or chemokine receptor due to genetic or environmental factors, it could be compensated by the presence of other molecules with similar functions, illustrating the robustness of chemokine signaling.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this chapter.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules [@zweemer_2014]. 
Moreover, there are also a few exceptions of exclusive chemokine-chemokine receptor pairs, including  CX3CL1 and its only receptor, CX3CR1, forming a non-promiscuous pair. <!-- Noting the CKRs' diverse cellular distribution and the complexity of chemokine ligand-receptor interactions, it is evident that chemokine receptors may activate different intracellular pathways in a ligand- and cell-specific context (see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part c).  -->

#### Dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions {#chemockrinteractions} 

Besides complex relations between chemokine ligands and their receptors, several chemokine regions are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction.
In addition to N-terminal, a chemokine region widely believed to be sufficient for binding specific CKRs,<!-- receptor N-terminus is not sufficient to recognize chemokine ligand and signal transduction.--> chemokine N-loop has been documented to be a critical domain of chemokine receptor recognition and activation for many chemokine-chemokine receptor pairs (for example: @booth_2002, @fernando_2007, @love_2012). <!-- but also N-loop Dokońcyć to zdanie, więcej przykladów Not only N-terminus is a key part of receptor activation, as previously thought,  but also N-loop // N-terminus: Similarly, CX3CL1, and cysteine motif [@davis_2004], demonstrating that the subtle structural changes in one chemokine domain can significantly alter receptor activation by eliciting conformational changes in another domain.-->
Moreover, as exemplified by a CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, extracellular domains of CXCR4 also participate in ligand recognition and selectivity [@chevign_2014], further supporting the notion that chemokine-CRK interactions are highly dynamic.<!-- When considering CXCL12 and its receptors in this context, extracellular loops also interact with chemokine N-termini and strongly influence CKR activation, as was recently shown by Chevigné and colleagues at CXCR4 [6,7,81,82]. zmienić citations Kleist 2016 a konkretniej Chevigne/// In all, these data show that chemokines can preferentially bind unique subsets of EC domains and/or available receptor conformations to elicit specific functional outcomes. --><!--Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation illustrated that highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif, located distal to both N-terminal and N-loop residues, may also be essential for the activation of CXCR1 or CXCR2 by CXCL8, further suggesting that chemokine-CRK interactions are highly dynamic and regulated by several domains . motif dictates substates of the CXCL8 conformational ensemble. We conclude that the GP motif enables diverse receptor functions by controlling cross-talk between Site-I and Site-II, and further propose that the repertoire of chemokine functions is best described by a conformational ensemble model in which a network of long-range coupled indirect interactions mediate receptor activity--><!-- It is thought that this phenomenon may be present in a greater number of chemokine/chemokine receptor pairs. Therefore, it seems plausible that different chemokine receptors N-termini may selectively bind specific chemokine orientations, resulting in unique functional outcomes for a specific receptor. -->

#### Posttranslational modifications

Moreover, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination [@loos_2008] or cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other proteases (@hughes_2018, @thompson_2017, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].
PTMs are present both under pathophysiological and physiological conditions.<!-- Despite their well-known detrimental actions in the CNS, such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurobehavioral abnormalities [@vergote_2006], post-translational enzymes could also serve many physiological functions.
For instance, during neurodevelopment, metalloproteinases also responsible for chemokines' postsynaptic modifications,  are related to plasticity and regeneration after CNS injury and disease, as well as neuronal migration  and neurite outgrowth and guidance. In addition, they contribute to synaptic plasticity and learning in the adult  CNS (for review: @vanhove_2012). -->
As mentioned above (see Section: \@ref(cx3cl1str)), one example is proteolytic processing of transmembrane CX3CL1 to release its soluble variant.
This process was reported to be elicited by many factors, such as neurotoxic insult, suggesting its important role in the regulation of inflammation [@chapman_2000].<!-- Consistent with this idea, many factors may control the soluble expression of CX3CL1. jakie? --><!-- Another fundamental finding was that upon stimulation, neurons from sensory pathways are able to cleave the membrane-attached CX3CL1 and release the soluble chemokine (Milligan et al. 2004).///These  findings indicate  that  the  cleavage  of  transmembrane  chemokines  into  their soluble  chemotactic  variants  may  have  an  important  role  in  the regulation of inflammation in human - CX3CL1 //// The post-translational expression of CX3CL1 may be conditioned by the following factors: BBB and BSCB dysfunction, proteolytic cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases, rapid binding to CX3CR1, and penetrating between three compartments including the extracellular space, CSF, and circulating blood [156,197,198]. @poniatowski_2016/// transmembrane protein from which a soluble variant can be released by proteolytic processing--><!-- All chemokines  are  produced  with  a  signal  peptide  at  the  N‐terminal  end,  which  is  removed  before secretion.  Besides, some present an extended C‐terminus and can bind to the cell surface through a mucin‐like  domain,  which  can  be  cleaved  later  to  release  the  proteins  into  the  extracellular  area (Hughes and Nibbs, 2018). -->
PTMs can also modulate CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis.
For instance, following CXCL12 binding, site-specific phosphorylation of CXCR4 was revealed to be dynamically regulated by multiple kinases resulting in both positivite and negative modulation of this receptor signaling [@busillo_2010].<!--  Phosphorylation of CXCR4 following CXCL12 binding similarly influences the  downstream signaling based upon the site phosphorylated.  Increased ERK1/2 activation follows CXCR4 engagement  with G-protein kinases 3 and 6 along with β-arrestin-2, while  reduced intracellular calcium is linked modification by G  protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 6 and arrestin-3 binding.38 Furthermore, phosphorylation of C-terminal residues is associated with increased β-arrestin recruitment  and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.38 The functionally different CXCR4 isoforms may provide a mechanism to extend the  capacity of CXCR4 to mediate varied effects under different  conditions or in different cell types. Thus, continued investigation of the mechanistic guidelines for the processes will  be invaluable to enabling improved therapeutic control of the  CXCR4 network.  --><!--CXCR4 signaling is modulated through the expression of  multiple isoforms and by posttranslational modifications.  Two CXCR4 isoforms, CXCR4-A and CXCR4-B, produced  by alternative splicing have been shown to bind to CXCL12  and induce chemotaxis in both mice and humans. CXCR4-B  but not CXCR4-A mediates efficient HIV-1 X4 binding and  infection, although the chemotactic activity affected through  each isoform was the same.32,33  // Tuning of CXCR4 signaling is achieved through the expression of two distinct  isoforms of the receptor.--><!-- CXCL12 is proteolytically cleaved and inactivated by matrix metalloproteinases-2 and −9, cleaving at position 4-5,  and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), cleaving at position 2-3,  and controlling concentration gradients of the chemokine.71  
The relative contributions of these enzymes in maintaining  the concentration gradient of CXCL12 remains uncertain.  -->
In addition,  CXCL12 might be proteolytically cleaved matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to the loss of its binding activity to CXCR4 [@mcquibban_2001].

#### Interactions with surface molecules

After being secreted from cells, chemokine availability and distribution are dependent on the interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM)<!-- especially gags?--> [@salanga_2011; @hughes_2018].
GAGs, polysaccharides present both at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, are particularly important in this regard.<!-- A characteristic feature of most chemokines is that, in addition of binding chemokine receptors, they also interact with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are attached either to cell surface proteins, or form part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) network  -->
By binding chemokines, GAGs immobilize and accumulate them, which is an essential step for chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors. 
This results in:  (i) creating a gradient, which serves as a directional signal for migrating cells, (ii) enabling/disabling chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions, and (iii) transporting chemokines across cell surfaces [@tanino_2010].
Moreover, considering their cell-, tissue-, developmental stage-specific expression [@lortatjacob_2009], as well as their selectivity of chemokine binding, GAGs are emerging as a scaffold to ensure that particular chemokine mediating a specific function will be presented at the correct localization and time. <!--więcej cytowań// wcześniej GAGs' expression is specific for cell, tissue, and developmental stage  and their chemokine binding is demonstrated to be selective, they are emerging  --><!--GAGs chemokine binding is demonstrated to be selective, which apply as another mechanism of fine-tune cell response. /// GAGs may selectively bind chemokines and therefore fine-tune the immune response, because they display varying affinities for specific chemokines and are differentially expressed in time and location on specific cell types and tissues [12] /// Chemokines have a second important interaction with cell surface expressed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which mediates  their immobilization on the endothelial surface in order to provide their directional signal (41–43). This interaction was shown to be essential for their ability to recruit cells in vivo by the loss of activity of chemokine variants, which had abrogated GAGbinding capacity (44  ). Without the interaction with endothelial GAGs, most chemokines would be washed away from the local  production site, especially under flow conditions, diluted to  a concentration below the threshold required for binding, and  distributed uniformly throughout the vasculature such that no  localized chemotactic signal is generated for leukocytes to allow  directional mobilization-->
For instance, one of GAGs, heparin, was reported to modulate CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@vega_2011], illustrating that in addition to their known role in modulating local chemokine availability, GAG affect the chemokine/CKRs interaction.<!-- Therefore, GAGs-chemokine interactions illustrate a promising potential for future therapeutic intervention for many inflammation-related disorders, including multiple sclerosis. 
Accordingly, many different approaches regulating these interactions are being developed, including mutant chemokines, GAG-based chemokine-capturing hydrogels, or identification of inhibitors of the interaction [@crijns_2020]. ... trochę to nie ma sensu -->



#### Dimerization {#dimerization}

Like many other GPCRs, most chemokine receptors exist in multimeric form.<!-- However, the CKRs' ability to form dimers is yet another mechanism that is a part of chemokine signal transduction., but very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the monomerdimer equilibrium modulates in vivo function.  // Throughout the past two decades, it has been assumed that CKRs exist as monomers, which behave as fully competent signaling units. This assumption, in part, forms the basis of the classical two-site binding model. However, a number of studies demonstrated that CKRs can form homodimers and/or heterodimers ( Fig. 4 A) [152] . -->
Specifically, several CKRs can undergo dimerization (heterodimerization/homodimerization) or oligomerization processes (see Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part c). <!-- trochę zmienić...// Formation of homo- or heterodimers has been demonstrated for all four chemokine receptor subfamilies (C, CC, CXC, CX3C). Heterodimers of two different CC or CXC chemokines as well as cross-family CC/CXC heterodimers have also been reported [140–142] . -->
CXCR4 is one of the best-studied chemokine receptors in this context.
It was shown to undergo homodimerization upon CXCL12 binding, which was demonstrated to be crucial for its functionality and signaling [@babcock_2003; @mellado_2001; @toth_2004; @vilacoro_1999].<!-- It has been demonstrated that dimers of CXCR4 are preferentially internalized as compared to monomers when  stimulated with either CXCL12 or phorbol ester.48 CXCR4 homodimerization can promote activation of the JAK/STAT  pathway, leading to cellular polarization and chemotaxis.49,50 // Toth et al., 2004 // Following CXCL12 interaction, CXCR4 undergoes a homo-dimerization which is necessary for its functionality and signaling ( Mellado et al., 2001 ; Toth et al., 2004 ). -->
Moreover, microscopic approaches, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)  or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, revealed the constitutive expression of chemokine receptor dimers (for a review: @wang_2008).
Thus, chemokine ligands' binding is thought instead of stabilizing or reorganizing these pre-existing complexes  [@thelen_2010] than inducing this phenomenon.


CXCR4 receptors can also form heterodimers. 
When heterodimers of CXCR4 and CXCR5 form, binding of a cognate  ligand to either of these receptors inhibits chemokine binding  to the other via a mechanism known as allosteric trans-inhibition.51

Heterodimers can be formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., other CKRs or with opioid receptors), and thus, they underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity between chemokine-CKRs pairs [@kleist_2016].<!-- Additionally, heterodimerization has been identified as a major mechanism that underlies the positive or negative cooperation between chemokine-receptor pairs [@wang_2008]  /// Pioneer studies on the interactions among different chemokines have revealed that they can antagonize chemokine receptors [13 – 17] or synergize with other chemokines. The synergism can occur at different levels, involving either 2 chemokine receptors triggered simultaneously or sequentially exposed to their agonists [18 – 22] or the activation of one type of chemokine receptor triggered by chemokine heterocomplexes [23].///MOJE ZDANIE : While antagonistic activity is mainly due to antagonizing CKRs, synergism may be manifested as simultaneous or sequential activation of CKRs at concentrations of each of chemokines which normally are unable to activate those receptor or the activation of one CKRs triggered by chemokine heterocomplexes.  może lepiej napisać? Chemokines heterocomplexes induce activation of chemokine receptors in the presence of low concentrations of chemokine selective agonists that, in the absence of the synergy-inducing chemokine, would, per se, be inactive [23, 36]. This// .Positive cooperation takes place when both chemokines, each at concentration unable to activate receptor, induce signaling cascade as a // Consistent with this idea, it was shown that the combination of CCL2 and CCL5 able to induce adhesion The combination of CCL2 and CCL5, each at much lower doses inefficient to trigger calcium responses, showed strong effects (synergy) in an adhesion assay, indicating a gain-of-function for the mixture [30] @wang_2008///  Heterodimerization has been identified as a major mechanism that underlies the synergistic activity of various chemokine pairs (51, 52), as well as chemokines with other inflammatory mediators (53). - Collins2017 // Of note, negative cooperation between chemokines was reported recently.-->
For instance, CXCR4 can form heterodimers with other chemokine receptors, such as CCR2 or CCR5 [@contento_2008; @isik_2008; @sohy_2007; @wang_2006] or GPCRs outside of the chemokine family, including `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~1A/B~-adrenergic receptors [@tripathi_2015] and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-opioid receptors [@pello_2008].<!--  CXCL12 and its antagonist AMD3100 can inhibit CCL2 binding only in cells co-expressing CCR2 and CXCR4, but not CCR2 alone, suggesting that binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 in the heterodimer transinhibited the binding of CCL2 to its receptor CCR2 in the receptor heterodimer.  zmienić i wang_2008 // However, by co-expressing in the membrane of Xenopus oocytes GABABreceptors tagged with Td tomato (red fluorophore) and CXCR4 receptors tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), data obtained in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy showed that CXCR4 and GABABreceptors did not co-localize in the membrane (A. Guyon, unpublished data). ( Percherancier et al., 2005 ; Pello et al., 2008 ; Levoye et al., 2009 ; Sohy et al., 2009 ). // This could lead to complex responses according to the chemokines/peptides/neuromediator environment present in the extracellular medium.--><!-- For instance, CXCR4 has a propensity to form hetero- and homooligomers [@babcock_2003; @percherancier_2005], and such oligomerization could play a role in the allosteric regulation of CXCR4 signaling [@wang_2008; @wu_2010]. ///However, it is not clear that native CCR5 can directly bind CXCR4 and one study reported only weak binding of CCR5 and CXCR4 by BRET assay [@babcock_2003]. // CCR2 and CXCR4 were shown to heterodimerize by BRET analysis. --><!-- SYNERGY Furthermore, CXCL12 synergizes with CXCL14 in the induction of primary human lymphoid cell  chemotaxis. The maximal chemotactic response achieved  with CXCL12 stimulation alone can be exceeded by combination with CXCL14.82 Additional examples of synergy with CXCL12, including CCL3, CCL21, and CXCL-8, to induce  chemotaxis have been reported.-->
Importantly, CXCR4 heterodimerizes with another CXCL12 receptor, ACKR3 [@levoye_2009; @dcaillot_2011], leading to decreased G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ signaling and constitutive `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin recruitment [@dcaillot_2011].
As a consequence, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-linked signaling pathways are potentiated, including ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, p38 MAPK, and SAPK, resulting in increased cell migration compared  to homodimers [@dcaillot_2011].<!--// which results in impaired activation of Gαi and  increased binding of β-arrestin, leading to potentiation of the  ERK1/2, p38, MAPK, and SAPK pathways and enhanced  chemotactic response to CXCL12, as compared to CXCR4  activation alone.  // including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK as judged from the results of experiments /// Taken together, these results identify CXCR4/CXCR7 heterodimers as distinct functional units with novel properties, which can contribute to the functional plasticity of CXCL12 /// Additionally, CXCR4 and ACKR3 can form heterodimers,--><!--Interaction of CXCR4 and CXCL12 was first understood as  a non-promiscuous signaling network. However, the discovery of multiple CXCR4 receptor isoforms then led to the observation that CXCR4 monomers combine to form a variety  signaling units which influence signal termination. FRET and  crystallization studies suggest CXCR4 constitutively forms both monomers and dimers 45 and CXCL12 binding shifts the equilibrium in favor of dimer formation.46 Allosteric ligands bind to the CXCR4 receptor at a different site to the  one at which agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists bind. Such ligands might be intra- or extra-cellular molecules or,  indeed, another G-protein receptor.-->
Besides its heterodimer with CXCR4, ACKR3 was also shown to form constitutive homodimers [@kalatskaya_2009; @levoye_2009; @luker_2009].
Moreover, both CXCR4 and ACKR3 were shown to form heterodimers with BILF1, a GPCR receptor, present at the surface of viral-infected antibody secreting cells [@vischer_2008], suggesting the crucial function of this phenomenon also in the immunology. 

Additionally, some chemokines or CKRs have been shown to form higher-order oligomers [@kleist_2016]. <!-- tetramers ( e.g. CCL2, CCL5, CCL27, CXCL4, and CX3CL1) or higher-order oligomers  [130,135–139]. --><!-- The biological relevance of chemokine dimerization is still a matter of debate and its impact on receptor binding, stoichiometry and biased signaling remains to be unraveled [128,132,150,151] @kleist_2016.///   the vast majority of chemokines are able to form dimeric species, with the monomer-dimer equilibrium being regulated by factors such as pH, anions and interactions with glycosaminoglycans [127,128] ///Thus, dimers may provide new targets for chemokine receptor-based therapies. Synthetic peptides of TM regions of chemokine receptors may interfere with homologous interactions and inhibit functional activity of the receptors. /// Chemokines not only interact with receptors where different oligomeric forms can induce different signaling responses, they also interact with glycosaminoglycans which can stabilize oligomers and other structures that would not otherwise form in solution -->
Among these immune proteins, CXCR4 was illustrated to exist in the form of both homo-oligomeric [@hamatake_2009] and hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR4 [@sohy_2009].

Intriguingly, as exemplified by CXCL12, besides CKRs complexes, chemokine ligand can also form dimers, inducing alternative signaling responses [@veldkamp_2005].
This phenomenon was also reported to be critical for chemokine functionality, their binding to CKRs, and activation of different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011; @wang_2008].<!-- Dimerization has been reported as critical for chemokine functionality, their binding to CKRs, and activation of different signaling pathways.zdecydowanie bardziej zmienić!!!!!!!wytlumaczyć różnice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /homo/hetero/oligomerization // as well as can act as multimeric forms, homo- or heterodimers [248–250].CKRs from all four subfamilies (C, CC, CXC, CX3C) have now been described to form homo- or heterodimers in vitro [154,164–166] and some of them, including CXCR4 and CCR5, were shown to interact with other families of GPCRs such as thea1A/B-adrenergic receptors [167] , opioid receptors [168] or non-GPCR membrane proteins that modulate the activity of the receptor or act as coreceptor for certain nonconventional ligands ( Fig. 4 A) [169]. // Hetero-dimerization may allow for enhanced or specific functions of receptors and may be essential for receptor activity.  Receptor dimerization has also been shown to modulate properties of ligand binding or activation of different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011]. /// Receptor dimerization has been shown to modify ligand binding properties [155,170] and receptor signaling [153,167,171,172] as well as intracellular trafficking [158] .  However, so far there is no in vivo data reporting the existence of CKR dimers and therefore their biological relevance remains controversial [152,173] @kleist_2016---><!--Previously, CKRs dimerization was thought to be induced by the binding of chemokine ligands.-->
Consistently, by using computational approaches, it was illustrated that such chemokine ligand complexes might dynamically change their stoichiometries and structures [@cutolo_2017], which can also contribute to the functional plasticity of CXCL12 signaling.<!-- zmienić? /// However, chemokine oligomers, including CXCL12, appear to be functional and to induce alternative signaling responses, such as cellular activation or signals to halt migration (55,60,61), which suggests the concept that these complexes dynamically change their stoichiometries and structures as part of their functional regulation. // CXCL12 isoform and stoichiometry exert a regulatory effect over activation of CXCR4 signaling pathways. Constitutively  homodimeric CXCL12, bridged by the N-terminal of CXCR4 peptides, results in calcium influx and inhibition of chemotaxis,  whereas monomeric CXCL12 remains chemotactic.83-->
Moreover, dimer formation was shown to be regulated by several other factors, such as mentioned previously interactions between CKRs and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [@salanga_2011]. <!--Chemokine receptors may also associate with cell surface molecules other than chemokine receptors, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).--><!-- CXCL12 can exist in monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms 80; each of which can have differential effects on signaling and cellular processes. CXCL12 hetero-dimerization  has functional consequence, particularly in the setting of  inflammation. Following tissue damage, inflammatory cells  migrate into the tissue and release cytokines such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1).  Recruitment of mononuclear  cells to sites of damage depends upon CXCL12-HMGB1 heterodimerization and binding to CXCR4, promoting different  conformational changes in CXCR4 as compared to CXCL12  binding alone.81 -->

#### Biased signaling {#biasedsignaling}

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors that provides a framework for understanding how a finite set of chemokine ligands generates myriad functionally diverse outcomes (for a comprehensive review, see: @eiger_2021, @zweemer_2014, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part d).<!--może bardziej podkreślić, że to GPCRs property/characteristics,/// biased signaling or functional selectivity [179,180] . Biased signaling appears to be ubiquitous among CKRs, and it provides a framework for understanding how a finite cast of ligands generates myriad functionally diverse outcomes. Biased signaling has been subdivided into three categories: ligand bias, receptor bias and cellular or tissue bias [4,5,181,182] .-->
It can be grouped into three categories: 
(1) ligand bias,
(2) receptor bias, and
(3) cellular/tissue bias.   

Chemokine ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines could preferentially activate different intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, although binding to the same receptor.<!--Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin. // This type of biased signaling has been documented for many chemokines, including chemokines activating CCR7, CCR10, CXCR2, CCR2, and CCR4 receptors [@kleist_2016]. <!-- CCL19/CCL21 at CCR7, CCL27/CCL28 at CCR10 [5], CXCL7/CXCL8 at CXCR2 [185], as well as for chemokine ligands at CCR1, CCR2 [187] and CCR4 [188,189].-->
More subtle differences in the activation of downstream signaling proteins, such as ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` activation or Ca^2+^ mobilization, are also included [@zweemer_2014].<!-- Interestingly, this type of signaling also includes more subtle differences in the activation of other downstream signaling proteins, such as ERK activation or Ca^2+^ mobilization -->
Importantly, @drury_2011 demonstrated that while monomeric CXCL12 inhibited cAMP signaling and recruited `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-2 pathways, dimeric form of this chemokine activated G-protein-dependent signaling, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and the activation of ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`.
These findings strongly suggest that dimerization might elicit biased signaling, and the mechanisms of chemokine signaling may be interconnected.  <!-- previously mentioned post-translational changes, such as truncation or citrullination, together with dimerization were reported to  /// Monomeric CXCL12 mobilized intracellular calcium, inhibited cAMP signaling, recruitedβ-arrestin-2, and stimulated filamentous-actinaccumulation and cell migration. Dimeric CXCL12 activated G-protein-dependent calcium flux, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and the rapid activation of ERK1/2, but only weakly, if at all, recruited arrestin, stimulated actin polymerization, or promoted chemotaxis. // NMR analyses illustrated that CXCL12 monomers made specific contacts with CXCR4 that were lost following dimerization. --> 

Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds  multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
ACKR3 is an excellent example of a biased receptor. 
As a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 is thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration [@naumann_2010].<!-- Also in line with being a ACKR member, ACKR3 was thought to provide only scavenging function, sequestering extracellular CXCL12, and decreasing signaling capacity through CXCR4 [@naumann_2010]. -->
However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 was also able to signal *via* `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin pathway [@rajagopal_2010a; @wang_2011].
Moreover, although CXCR4 and ACKR3 are activated by the same chemokine, they signal through different pathways (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin vs G-coupled).<!-- poprawić -->
Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a β-arrestin biased receptor.<!-- However, it was later discovered that  ACKR3 not only acted as a decoy receptor, but also was capable of  independently signaling via β-arrestins [66]. // CXCR4 and ACKR3 signal  through different pathways despite being activated by the same ligand,  with CXCR4 activating both G proteins and β-arrestins and ACKR3  signaling only via β-arrestins; therefore ACKR3 acts as a β-arrestin biased  receptor relative to CXCR4 // [@rajagopal_2010a; @wang_2011]-->
Nonetheless, more recently it was shown that this receptor has functionality independent of the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins.
For example, [@montpas_2018] demonstrated that both siRNA knockdown of  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin 1 and or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells does not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of its chemokine ligands. <!-- Interestingly, recent work has demonstrated that β-arrestin recruitment to ACKR3 is dispensable for some receptor functionality. Montpas et al. show that both siRNA knockdown of  β-arrestin 1 and or β-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells does not impact ACKR3  mediated degradation of CXCL11 or CXCL12 [70]. They repeated these  studies in β-arrestin 1 and 2 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and also saw that ACKR3 chemokine scavenging was unaffected. [@montpas_2018] -->
In addition, next studies further complicate this issue by illustrating  that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ levels following the activation of PTX-sensitive G~i/o~ proteins, leading to either proliferation  or  differentiation of astrocytes [@odemis_2010].  
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: @bajetto_2001a), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes, but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor [@odemis_2012]. <!-- CXCL12-mediated ACKR3 signaling was initially described to require β-arrestin.66 However, this has since been challenged by findings in human astrocytes that activation of ACKR3 by  CXCL12 can be G-protein mediated.6-->
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells.
Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist [@burns_2006], resulted in activation of `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting [@odemis_2012].  
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.  
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification. 
Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs  astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Cx43 internalization in a `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2-dependent manner [@fumagalli_2020], whereas CXCR4 leads to NF-K`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` activation with consequent TNF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` and glutamate release from these cells [@bezzi_2001; @cal_2008; @cal_2010].
Therefore, these findings suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions *via* different signaling pathways in astrocytes. <!--In addition, ACKR3-mediated cell signaling occurs in primary interneurons (Wang et al., 2011) and astrocytes  [@odemis_2010]. --><!--  /// Along the same line, we recently demonstrated that in primary astrocytes, CXCL12-dependent activation of several signaling molecules/ pathways including Erk, Akt, and PKC  is entirely mediated by ACKR3 (Odemis et al., 2010).  --><!--Since ACKR3 associates b -arrestin, it has been suggested that ACKR3 would affect cell function through a b -arrestin-dependent mechanism (Luker et al., 2009; Kalatskaya et al., 2009; Rajagopal et al., 2010a; Zabel et al., 2009).--> <!--We now provide evidence that in primary rodent astrocytes and human astrocytoma cell lines, ACKR3 induces cell signaling and controls cell proliferation and migration through pertussis toxin-sensitive G~i/o~ proteins. Along the same line, we observed that CXCL12-induced increases in [Ca^2+^]i are sensitive to the ACKR3 antagonist, CCX771 (Zabel et al., 2009), but not to the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD31000 (Hatse et al., 2002).The  previously  reported  failure  of  CXCL12-bound ACKR3 to activate G proteins in nonastroglial cells has been primarily attributed to the fact that ACKR3 contains a modified DRYLAIV motif (Thelen and Thelen, 2008). --><!--While ACKR3 was suggested to signal *via* beta-arrestin-dependent pathway [@rajagopal_2010a]While until now biased receptor function  has  only  been  observed  with  experimentally mutated  GPCRs,  a  recent  work  demonstrated  that ACKR3 acts as a biased receptor in HEK-293 cells and signals exclusively through b -arrestin (Rajagopal et al., 2010a).  Notably, in astrocytes signaling of CXCL12-bound ACKR3 was sensitive to PTX, but was not affected by depletion of b -arrestin1 or b -arrestin2. Vice versa, signaling of the alternative ACKR3 ligand, I-TAC (Burns et al., 2006), was unaffected by PTX, but was abolished following depletion of b -arrestin2. These findings are consistent with the view that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes. Mechanistically, receptor or ligand-biased signaling of ACKR3 might be determined by whether or not CXCL12-bound ACKR3 couples to G proteins in a given cell type. -->
Thus, these data illustrate that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019].  <!--Moreover, although the results of the present study add another piece to the growing body of evidence that ACKR3 is unable to trigger G protein signaling, it cannot be excluded that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 could induce G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019]. --><!-- These findings demonstrate that ACKR3, while  technically a β-arrestin-biased receptor as it does not signal via heterotrimeric G proteins, has functionality independent of the β-arrestins, highlighting the complexity of biased agonism at GPCRs.-->

Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts. <!-- System bias is primarily regulated through the differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, which consequentially promote biased cellular outputs [39] These include every element of the  signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors such as GRKs, G  proteins and β-arrestins, to other proteins that regulate second  messenger responses, such as Regulator of G Protein Signaling (RGS) and  Activator of G Protein Signaling (AGS) proteins, to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery. This phenomenon manifests as observed differences in signaling events between cell types. --><!--Notably, these biased responses can be modulated through changes in ligand, receptor, and or the specific cellular context (system)--><!-- . -->
This is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including  every element of the  signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.<!--Of note, pathway activation depends on the cellular expression and availability of signaling elements, resulting in cell-specific differences, which is reffered to as a system/cellular/tissue bias. -->

Thus, a final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the recpetor, and the spatiotemporal context. <!--Thus, a final cellular behavior highly depends on the ligand, the receptor and the transducer elements in the context of the ... A final cellular output is highly dependent on (1) the ligand, (2) the  receptor, and (3) the transducer elements in the context of the cellular system. These three elements are the ultimate facilitators of biased  signaling, and understanding the structural and functional bases of their  interactions is integral to understanding potential mechanisms of biased  agonism // Therefore, biased signaling is another mechanism of chemokine signaling contributing to our better understanding of how chemokine ligands coordinate such diverse and complex multiple cell functions.-->


#### Non-chemokine CKR ligands {#nonchemokineligands}

Chemokine receptors may also bind molecules other than chemokine, such as ubiquitin or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-defensins [@hughes_2018].<!-- The chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR2, CXCR4 and ACKR3 bind endogenous or virus-encoded ligands other than chemokines.-->
Although these unconventional CKRs ligands often have no sequence or structural resemblance with chemokines, they can usually induce signaling pathways similar to those triggered by conventional ligands.<!-- These unconventional ligands vary widely in size, ranging from large proteins ( e.g. >100 kDa) to peptides, and often have no sequence or structural similarities with chemokines [15,169,208,209]. Despite their structural dissimilarities, nonchemokine CKR ligands can trigger signaling pathways similar to those induced by endogenous chemokines, although in some cases they initiate unconventional signaling responses [15,169,208– 212]. //In addition to CXCL12, CXCR4 also binds extracellular ubiquitin (eUb, 8.6 kDa). The eUb-CXCR4 interaction was proposed to follow a two-site binding model, leading to G protein signaling similar to that induced by CXCL12 [15] . Other endogenous non-chemokine ligands such as human b 3-defensin (HDB-3) (5.1 kDa) [223] and EPI-X4 (1.8 kDa), a 16-amino acid peptide derived from human albumin [224] , also interact with CXCR4 but fail to induce intracellular signaling.  --> 
For example, in addition to CXCL12, CXCR4 was reported to bind macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and extracellular ubiquitin; however, these ligands differentially impact the signaling  pathways downstream of CXCR4 [@klasen_2014; @saini_2010].<!-- These ligands  and, therefore, therapeutic  intervention at the level of CXCR4 ligands might provide opportunity for finer tuning compared to CXCR4 antagonism. // CXCRs, including CXCR4, signal  through  a  pertussis  toxin-sensitive  G-protein-coupled  phospholipase  C (PLC)  (Wu et al., 1993) , raising inositol   1,4,5   trisphosphate   InsP-dependent cytosolic Ca level   Murphy and Tiffany, 1991 . -->
Moreover, recent studies have shown that ACKR3 also serves as a receptor for endogenous opioids, contributing to circadian glucocorticoid oscillations [@ikeda_2013] and acting as a decoy for  opioids in the brain [@meyrath_2020].<!--mocno zmienić... Additional studies have shown that  ACKR3 also serves as a receptor for endogenous opioids, contributing to  circadian glucocorticoid oscillations [68] and acting as a decoy for  opioids in the brain [69].

#### Summary

In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, just to list a few. <!-- cellular survival, growth, proliferation, and migration. /// is implicated in many physiological systems, from CXCL12-induced signaling in homing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the bone marrow108  to neovascularization,109 angiogenesis,110 neurogenesis,111  and adaptive immune responses.112 -->

Complicating these levels of regulation is the fact that overall protein synthesis rates are high in the young brain, decline through adulthood, and fall sharply with old age [13], [56]. Protein turnover in the brain appears to follow a similar pattern [13]; however, little is known about the effects of age on other protein modifications. In addition, proteins such as GFAP show increased metabolic turnover with age, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. Our results are consistent with independent regulation of chemokine expression at the mRNA and post-translational levels. [@watson_2020]

Transport of chemokines inside cells occurs via the canonical protein trafficking pathway associated with endoplasmic reticulum and   Golgi     [6]  .   
Overall, the secretion of chemokines varies vastly between cell types   and   activation stimuli   and can involve a myriad of secretory pathways, including secretory   granules and vesicles   [2, 5, 6]  . [@watson_2020] 

CXCR4 activation is implicated in many physiological systems, from CXCL12-induced signaling in homing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the bone marrow108  to neovascularization,109 angiogenesis,110 neurogenesis,111  and adaptive immune responses.112 Dysregulation of the CXCR4 network is evident in multiple pathologies including viral infection,113 malignancy,114 ischemic disease,7  inflammatory disease,115 autoimmune conditions,116 and immunodeficiency in the Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia,  Immunodeficiency, and Myelokathexis syndrome (WHIM)  disorder.117 Therefore, CXCR4 represents a potential therapeutic target for multiple diseases. However, while the nuanced biology of CXCR4 offers a finely tuneable system  influencing core physiology, therapeutic intervention should  consider the effects on the target tissue in context of its perturbation of other physiological processes, in order to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize off-target effects.  Hence, we briefly review the role of CXCR4 in physiological  processes.
