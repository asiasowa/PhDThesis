# Introduction

## Chemokines 

### Brief history of chemokines {#history}

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 [@yoshimura_1987]. 
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) [@meucci_1998]. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? 
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system [@williams_2014].
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions (see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)).
These results suggest their brain-specific functions, such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. 
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis [@trettel_2020].

### Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors {#classification}

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized [@hughes_2018]. 
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet on which a C-terminal `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix is folded (for review:  @miller_2017).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop<!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: @kleist_2016). 
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction -->

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting "ligand"), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (@zlotnik_2000, see Figure \@ref(fig:family)).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part a). <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, --> 
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:family), part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.  
The CX3C (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part d). 

(ref:family) *Chemokine families.* Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys – cysteine residue, X – amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines.

```


Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). 
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains.
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R”, which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure \@ref(fig:family)). 
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR [@hughes_2018].<!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... -->

Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011). <!-- The     binding     of     the     ligand     on     the     appropriate     chemokine     receptor     promotes     structural     changes     on     its     cytoplasmic     loops     and     tail, which     catalyze     the     exchange     of     GDP     with     GTP     on     the     alpha     subunit of     the     heterotrimeric     G     protein   [10]  .     The          and    betagamma     subunits     then dissociate     and     bind     to     cellular     effector     enzymes     that     generate     second     messengers     as     cAMP     or     IP3,     which,     in     turn,     activate     distinct signaling     pathways,     leading     to     different     cellular     responses.  -->

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives [@bachelerie_2014; @salvi_2017], structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018].  
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation [@bachelerie_2014; @bonecchi_2016; @nibbs_2013]. 
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: @salvi_2017). 
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS <!--citations-->(see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)), along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter \@ref(behavior)). 

In addition, the classical, formulated in the mid-1900s classification, divided chemokines into inflammatory (or inducible) chemokines, whose expression is upregulated upon inflammation, and homeostatic chemokines, which display constitutive expression.
Several chemokines share both properties and have been called dual-function chemokines [@zlotnik_2012].
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic.
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors that bind homeostatic chemokines were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species [@nomiyama_2013], highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases.

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively, as they are expressed in the brain under non-inflammatory, basal conditions. 

#### CX3CL1/ CX3CR1 {#cx3cl1str}

CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` family [@pan_1997]. <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.-->
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997].<!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--><!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids [@zlotnik_2012]. 
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) *via* the action of several proteases [@bajetto_2001a; @schulte_2007]. <!--(for example: @schulte_2007)(Garton et al., 2001).-->
These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17<!--TACE?-->, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS)<!--(TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme)-->, acting both in the periphery and the CNS [@clark_2007; @cook_2010; @garton_2001; @hundhausen_2003; @jones_2013].
While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration [@ransohoff_2009]. 
Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a G~i~-protein-coupled receptor [@imai_1997].  
The subunit G~i~ inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a variety of intracellular second messengers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) [@alaoukaty_1998; @chandrasekar_2003]. <!--  The  subunit  protein  Gi  inhibits  the  production of cAMP, triggering a variety of intracellular second messengers including  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K),  protein  kinase  B (AKT)  and  nuclear  factor  kappa-light-chain-enhancer  of  activated  B  cells  (NFk B),  which  are  well-known  for  mediating  a wide  range  of  cellular  functions,  including  apoptosis,  proliferation,  transcription  and  migration  (Al-Aoukaty  et  al.,  1998; Chandrasekar  et  al.,  2003).  -->  
These molecules are known for regulating a wide range of cellular functions,  including apoptosis,  proliferation,  transcription, and migration. <!-- regulates  apoptotic,  proliferative,  transcriptional  and  migratory functions  in  microglia-->


#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 {#cxcl12str}

CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily.
In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`,  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B5")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C6")`), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa [@yu_2006]. 
The `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one [@yu_2006].
Hence, as used here, the term "CXCL12" refers to the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation.  
It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. <!-- citation i trochę zmienić...-->
However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological processes [@britton_2021]. <!-- zmienić trochę --> 
CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet held in close apposition to an `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation [@murphy_2007; @wu_2010].
CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7.
All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013; @nomiyama_2015].
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 [@balabanian_2005]. 

Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, there is an enhancement of receptor-ligand binding and subsequently the induction of GDP-GTP exchange and dissociation of the G proteins. <!-- bardziej zmienić CXCR4 ligand  binding induces a two-stage conformational change which  first enhances receptor-ligand binding and subsequently triggers GDP-GTP exchange and dissociation of the G proteins.6 // Following ligand binding of CXCR4, GDP exchanges for GTP and the trimeric Gi-protein dissociates into its constituent parts, Gαi and βγ.18 CXCR4 is typically associated with the Gαi type of G-protein, which activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Phospholipase  C (PLC), while the βγ subunit activates PLC, PI3K, and integrins.21 // When CXCL12 binds CXCR4, different downstream intracellular pathways effect different cellular phenotypes.--> 
CXCR4 is typically associated with the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ type of G-protein, which activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase  C (PLC), while the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` subunit activates PLC, PI3K, and integrins. 

G`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i and G`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` activate several intracellular signaling cascades which, through increased intracellular calcium, modification  of cellular proteins, and altered transcription factor binding  and gene expression, lead to chemotaxis, cell growth and  proliferation, and cell survival[@ganju_1998]. <!-- zmienić  Gαi and Gβγ activate several intracellular signaling cascades which, through increased intracellular calcium, modification of cellular proteins, and altered transcription factor binding and gene expression, leading to chemotaxis, cell growth and proliferation, and cell survival.18  //  PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 increases the intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum22 while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC).23 // Both intracellular free calcium and PKC activate mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and  proliferation.22--> 

The αi subunit both inhibits adenylate cyclase, decreasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and activating the Ras-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway resulting  in cell cycle entry and proliferation.24 
Both Gαi and Gβγ increase flux through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)Akt pathway.25 Akt promotes cell survival via inactivation of the Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein and activation of  mTor26,27 and through GSK-3 inactivation (thus preventing cyclin D1 degradation and promoting G1-S phase cell cycle  progression28) increases NF-kB-associated gene transcription and also stabilizes β-catenin which increases the transcription of genes linked to cell proliferation.CXCR4 also binds to Gα12/13 and Gαq29 with both interactions promoting CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. However,  the mechanisms of signaling leading to migration vary according to the G protein involved: Gαq through Rac and PLC  and Gα12/13 through Rho.30

Once activated, Galphai inhibits adenyl cyclases – and the consequent cAMP production – and stimulates the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases [43] that activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, modulating cell cycle progression through the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc [44]. In parallel, CXCR4-oriented migration is mediated by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which can be activated by both G betagamma and G alpha subunits [45]. PI3Ks regulate gene transcription, cell migration and cell adhesion by the phosphorylation of AKT and of several focal adhesion components [19,46]. Furthermore, Gbeta/Ggamma dimer can trigger phospholipase C (PLC) activation, which, in turn, catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (IP3) and dyacil glycerol (DAG). IP3 production results in Ca2+mobilization from the intracellular stores [11], while DAG promotes the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) [47]. In addition to the well-characterized coupling to Galpha I, evidence reveals that CXCR4 can also signal via other G alpha proteins such as G alpha q, G alpha o, and G alpha s [48]. Moreover, it is well documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal pathway [49]. Following CXCL12 binding, CXCR4 promotes the recruitment of G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) that induce site-specific phosphorylation at the C-terminus resulting in association with beta -arrestins [19] . Arrestin recruitment leads to the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and induces receptor internalization [50]. PKC, PKA, and c-Src can promote GPCR internalization by enhancing GRK2 activ

Following CXCR4 activation, the intracellular C-terminal domain phosphorylation results in `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin recruitment, which sterically hinders further G-protein engagement. <!-- zmienić  Following CXCR4 activation, phosphorylation of the intracellular C-terminal domain results in β-arrestin recruitment, which sterically hinders further G-protein engagement. //

<!-- High affinity binding to CXCL12 requires the extracellular  N-terminal domain of CXCR4 which must be post-translationally modified by tyrosine sulfation.20

However,  the mechanisms of signaling leading to migration varies according to the G protein involved: Gαq through Rac and PLC  and Gα12/13 through Rho.30 
It is not known which ligands bias Gα12/13 and Gαq above the canonical Gαi activation.β-arrestin engagement with CXCR4 can be similarly intricate; distinct receptor conformations differentially drive signal induction, desensitization, and endocytosis. Structural studies reveal two distinct conformations: one in which β-arrestin docks with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of  CXCR4 and a second in which β-arrestin is also coupled to the core transmembrane region. Studies using CXCR4 mutants  reveal that the association of β-arrestin with the phosphorylated  GPCR C-terminal tail drives β-arrestin signaling and receptor internalization, though not desensitization. Dissociation of β-arrestin from the internalized G-protein facilitates CXCR4  recycling back to the plasma membrane.31  --><!-- Once activated, Galphai inhibits adenyl cyclases – and the consequent cAMP production – and stimulates the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases [43] that activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, modulating cell cycle progression through the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc [44].

The bicyclam derivative AMD3100  (plerixafor injection; Mozobil  [Sanofi]), previously called JM3100, acts as a specific antagonist by  blocking the binding pocket of CXCR4 (  13,14  ). The first clinical  trials with AMD3100 were designe  d for the treatment of HIV. In-  terestingly, an increased amount of white blood cells was observed in  healthy volunteers in phase 1 clinical trials (  15  ). This finding led to  the discovery that AMD3100 mobilizes CD34  1  human hematopoi-  etic stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow to peripheral  blood (  16  ). Finally, AMD3100 was approved by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration as a mobilizer of hematopoietic CD34  1  cells  from the bone marrow to the circulation (  17,18  ). Orally available  CXCR4 antagonists include AMD070 (  19,20  ).  ACKR3 (@meyrath_2020; @fumagalli_2020; @banisadr_2016; @schnemeier_2008; @gttle_2010, see: Table1, Figure 2C). -->


Similar to the other ACKRs, ACKR3 contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs<!--see figure...-->, which is thought to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation [@thelen_2008].<!-- This is partly because of either modification or lack of the typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV) known to be essential for efficient coupling with the G~$\alpha$i~ class G-proteins. ///  This motif represents a highly conserved region within the second intracellular loop of GPCRs and is assumed to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation. Indeed, several established atypical chemokine receptors such as D6, DARC, and CCXCKR either lack the DRYLAIV motif or exhibit a modified motif (Graham, 2009). However, other chemokine receptors such as lymphotactin receptors and CXCR6, also showing modifications of the DRYLAIV motif, still signal through G proteins (Thelen and Thelen, 2008). These discrepancies are currently regarded as an indication that at least in the case of some GPCRs, the DRYLAIV motif is not sufficient for  G protein coupling and requires additional sequences  (Thelen  and  Thelen, 2008). Consequently, modifications of the DRYLAIV motif, as exhibited by ACKR3, may not per se represent a reliable indicator for the lack of G protein coupling.--><!--Furthermore, ACKR3 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways.-->
Like other atypical receptors, ACKR3 was demonstrated to: (i) fail to activate G proteins and subsequent Ca^2+^-induced chemotaxis [@burns_2006; @levoye_2009; @rajagopal_2010a], (ii)  sequester CXCL12 extracellular gradient and thus control CXCR4-mediated cell migration ///by sequestering extracellular CXCL12 and, hence, shaping the extracellular chemokine gradient  (Boldajipour  et  al.,  2008). More recently, this scavenger function was additionally highlighted by the demonstration of a constant cycling of ACKR3 between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as well as a nonsaturating binding of CXCL12 to ACKR3 (Naumann et al., 2010). Intriguingly, despite this atypical function, ACKR3 induces cell signaling in various types of tumor cells and controls their growth,  adhesion,  and  transendothelial  migration (Burns et al., 2006; Grymula et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Zabel et al., 2009). -->
Interestingly, .... 

Moreover, unlike the rest of atypical receptors, ACKR3 was initially thought to only bind CXCL12 and CXCL11 (formerly known as interferon-inducible T-cell a chemoattractant, I-TAC) [@burns_2006].

As chemokines constitute a complex system, besides their function and signaling pathways are modulated *via* broad array of factors, which are discussed below, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.

### Chemokine signaling {#chemokinesignaling}

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now beginning to appreciate the extent and complexity of the mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling (see for reviews: @eiger_2021; @hughes_2018; @zweemer_2014). 
They enable tight and rapid control of chemokine signaling and quick response by the chemokine system to the dynamic microenvironment.
These processes include (1) redundancy, (2) post-translational modifications,  (3) dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, (4) atypical chemokine receptors, (5) dimerization, (6) interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and (7) biased-signaling. <!-- ominięte (4)  diversity in signaling pathways after chemokine activation, -->

#### Redundancy {#redundancy}

The most characteristic aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: @zlotnik_2000, @hughes_2018, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part b and Fig. \@ref(fig:chemoexpression)).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
There is a prevailing notion that in the absence (or blockade) of a particular chemokine or chemokine receptor due to genetic or environmental factors, it could be compensated by the presence of other molecules with similar functions, illustrating the robustness of chemokine signaling.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this chapter.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules [@zweemer_2014]. 
Moreover, there are also a few exceptions of exclusive chemokine-chemokine receptor pairs, including  CX3CL1 and its only receptor, CX3CR1, forming a non-promiscuous pair. 

#### Dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions {#chemockrinteractions} 

Besides complex relations between chemokine ligands and their receptors, several chemokine regions are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction.
In addition to N-terminal, a chemokine region widely believed to be sufficient for binding specific CKRs,<!-- receptor N-terminus is not sufficient to recognize chemokine ligand and signal transduction.--> chemokine N-loop has been documented to be a critical domain of chemokine receptor recognition and activation for many chemokine-chemokine receptor pairs (for example: @booth_2002, @fernando_2007, @love_2012). 
Moreover, as exemplified by a CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, extracellular domains of CXCR4 also participate in ligand recognition and selectivity [@chevign_2014], further supporting the notion that chemokine-CRK interactions are highly dynamic.

#### Posttranslational modifications

Moreover, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination [@loos_2008] or cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other proteases (@hughes_2018, @thompson_2017, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].
PTMs are present both under pathophysiological and physiological conditions.
As mentioned above (see Section: \@ref(cx3cl1str)), one example is proteolytic processing of transmembrane CX3CL1 to release its soluble variant.
This process was reported to be elicited by many factors, such as neurotoxic insult, suggesting its essential role in regulating inflammation [@chapman_2000].
PTMs can also modulate CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis.
For instance, following CXCL12 binding, site-specific phosphorylation of CXCR4 was revealed to be dynamically regulated by multiple kinases resulting in both positive and negative modulation of this receptor signaling [@busillo_2010].
In addition,  CXCL12 might be proteolytically cleaved matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to the loss of its binding activity to CXCR4 [@mcquibban_2001].

#### Interactions with surface molecules

After being secreted from cells, chemokine availability and distribution are dependent on the interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM)<!-- especially gags?--> [@salanga_2011; @hughes_2018].
GAGs, polysaccharides present both at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, are particularly important in this regard.
By binding chemokines, GAGs immobilize and accumulate them, which is an essential step for chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors. 
This results in:  (i) creating a gradient, which serves as a directional signal for migrating cells, (ii) enabling/disabling chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions, and (iii) transporting chemokines across cell surfaces [@tanino_2010].
Moreover, considering their cell-, tissue-, developmental stage-specific expression [@lortatjacob_2009], as well as their selectivity of chemokine binding, GAGs are emerging as a scaffold to ensure that particular chemokine mediating a specific function will be presented at the correct localization and time. 
For instance, one of GAGs, heparin, was reported to modulate CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@vega_2011], illustrating that in addition to their known role in modulating local chemokine availability, GAGs affect the chemokine/CKRs interaction.



#### Dimerization {#dimerization}

Like many other GPCRs, most chemokine receptors exist in multimeric form.
Specifically, several CKRs can undergo dimerization (heterodimerization/homodimerization) or oligomerization processes (see Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part c). 
CXCR4 is one of the best-studied chemokine receptors in this context.
It was shown to undergo homodimerization upon CXCL12 binding, which was demonstrated to be crucial for its functionality and signaling [@babcock_2003; @mellado_2001; @toth_2004; @vilacoro_1999].
Moreover, microscopic approaches, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)  or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, revealed the constitutive expression of chemokine receptor dimers (for a review: @wang_2008).
Thus, chemokine ligands' binding is thought instead of stabilizing or reorganizing these pre-existing complexes  [@thelen_2010] than inducing this phenomenon.


CXCR4 receptors can also form heterodimers. 
When heterodimers of CXCR4 and CXCR5 form, binding of a cognate  ligand to either of these receptors inhibits chemokine binding  to the other via a mechanism known as allosteric trans-inhibition.51

Heterodimers can be formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., other CKRs or opioid receptors), and thus, they underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity between chemokine-CKRs pairs [@kleist_2016].
For instance, CXCR4 can form heterodimers with other chemokine receptors, such as CCR2 or CCR5 [@contento_2008; @isik_2008; @sohy_2007; @wang_2006] or GPCRs outside of the chemokine family, including `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~1A/B~-adrenergic receptors [@tripathi_2015] and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-opioid receptors [@pello_2008].
Importantly, CXCR4 heterodimerizes with another CXCL12 receptor, ACKR3 [@levoye_2009; @dcaillot_2011], leading to decreased G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ signaling and constitutive `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin recruitment [@dcaillot_2011].
As a consequence, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-linked signaling pathways are potentiated, including ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, p38 MAPK, and SAPK, resulting in increased cell migration compared  to homodimers [@dcaillot_2011].

Besides its heterodimer with CXCR4, ACKR3 was also shown to form constitutive homodimers [@kalatskaya_2009; @levoye_2009; @luker_2009].
Moreover, both CXCR4 and ACKR3 were shown to form heterodimers with BILF1, a GPCR receptor, present at the surface of viral-infected antibody-secreting cells [@vischer_2008], suggesting the crucial function of this phenomenon also in immunology. 

Additionally, some chemokines or CKRs have been shown to form higher-order oligomers [@kleist_2016].
Among these immune proteins, CXCR4 was illustrated to exist in the form of both homo-oligomeric [@hamatake_2009] and hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR4 [@sohy_2009].

Intriguingly, as exemplified by CXCL12, besides CKRs complexes, chemokine ligand can also form dimers, inducing alternative signaling responses [@veldkamp_2005].
This phenomenon was also reported to be critical for chemokine functionality, their binding to CKRs, and activation of different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011; @wang_2008].
Consistently, by using computational approaches, it was illustrated that such chemokine ligand complexes might dynamically change their stoichiometries and structures [@cutolo_2017], which can also contribute to the functional plasticity of CXCL12 signaling.
Moreover, dimer formation was shown to be regulated by several other factors, such as mentioned previously mentioned interactions between CKRs and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [@salanga_2011]. 

#### Biased signaling {#biasedsignaling}

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors that provides a framework for understanding how a finite set of chemokine ligands generates myriad functionally diverse outcomes (for a comprehensive review, see: @eiger_2021, @zweemer_2014, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part d).
It can be grouped into three categories: 
(1) ligand bias,
(2) receptor bias, and
(3) cellular/tissue bias.   

Chemokine ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines could preferentially activate different intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, although binding to the same receptor.
More subtle differences in the activation of downstream signaling proteins, such as ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` activation or Ca^2+^ mobilization, are also included [@zweemer_2014].
Importantly, @drury_2011 demonstrated that while monomeric CXCL12 inhibited cAMP signaling and recruited `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-2 pathways, the dimeric form of this chemokine activated G-protein-dependent signaling, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and the activation of ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`.
These findings strongly suggest that dimerization might elicit biased signaling, and the mechanisms of chemokine signaling may be interconnected. 

Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
ACKR3 is an excellent example of a biased receptor. 
As a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 is thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration [@naumann_2010].
However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 was also able to signal *via* `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin pathway [@rajagopal_2010a; @wang_2011].
Moreover, although CXCR4 and ACKR3 are activated by the same chemokine, they signal through different pathways (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin vs. G-coupled).<!-- poprawić -->
Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a β-arrestin biased receptor.
Nonetheless, more recently, it was shown that this receptor has functionality independent of the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins.
For example, [@montpas_2018] demonstrated that both siRNA knockdown of  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin 1 and or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells does not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of its chemokine ligands. 
In addition, the following studies further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ levels following the activation of PTX-sensitive G~i/o~ proteins, leading to either proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes [@odemis_2010].  
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: @bajetto_2001a), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor [@odemis_2012]. 
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells.
Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist [@burns_2006], resulted in activation of `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting [@odemis_2012].  
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.  
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification. 
Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs  astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Cx43 internalization in a `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2-dependent manner [@fumagalli_2020], whereas CXCR4 leads to NF-K`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` activation with consequent TNF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` and glutamate release from these cells [@bezzi_2001; @cal_2008; @cal_2010].
Therefore, these findings suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions *via* different signaling pathways in astrocytes. 
Thus, these data illustrate that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019].  

Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts.
This type of bias is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.

Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal context. 

#### Non-chemokine CKR ligands {#nonchemokineligands}

Chemokine receptors may also bind molecules other than chemokine, such as ubiquitin or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-defensins [@hughes_2018].
Although these unconventional CKRs ligands often have no sequence or structural resemblance with chemokines, they can usually induce signaling pathways similar to those triggered by conventional ligands.
For example, in addition to CXCL12, CXCR4 was reported to bind macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and extracellular ubiquitin; however, these ligands differentially impact the signaling pathways downstream of CXCR4 [@klasen_2014; @saini_2010].
Moreover, recent studies have shown that ACKR3 also serves as a receptor for endogenous opioids, contributing to circadian glucocorticoid oscillations [@ikeda_2013] and acting as a decoy for opioids in the brain [@meyrath_2020].

#### Summary

In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, just to list a few. 
A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.
