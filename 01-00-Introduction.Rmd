# Introduction

## Chemokines

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins. 
They  were originally identified as serving chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins. 
So far, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized. <!--<http:// cytokine.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/>. not active link, find another database or use @Li2008a--> 
They can be classified into CXC, CC, C or CX3C (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) subfamilies based on the arrangement of the two cysteine residues near the N-terminus [@zlotnik_2000] \ref{family}. <!-- CX3C characterized by the presence of 3 amino acidic residues (X3) localized between 2 cysteine residues, thus forming a disulphide bond, a CX3C motif, and also a transmembrane domain (Pan et al., 1997). -->

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface receptors that belong to the superfamily of seven-membrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are expressed in a wide variety of cells [@bacon_2000]. 

<!--Chemokine receptors belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), showing the presence of 7 transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, as well as N-terminal extracellular and C-terminal intracellular domains. The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered important for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins, and is important for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. Based on their primary amino acid sequence and the respective ligands that they bind, chemokine receptors are also classified into four subfamilies, i.e., CXCR, CCR, CR and CX3CR (Proudfoot et al., 2010). - Paolicelli2014;; -->



Studies indicate that chemokines and their receptors interact with each other in a complex manner. 
There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction <!--[@howard_1996].inne cytowanie albo wyrzucić-->
Moreover, after interaction with chemokines, some receptors undergo dimerization (heterodimerization, homodimerization) and oligomerization process, which seems to be critical for the triggering of biological responses [@mellado_2001].

Chemokines were originally identified as serving chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins. 
Of particular interest is the idea that central nervous system (CNS) chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation, but also function as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in the brain [@adler_2005]. 
Like those systems, the chemokine system is widely but unevenly distributed in the brain and has both ligands and receptors expressed in neurons. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? 
The plausible explanation is that they may provide a bridge between the immune and nervous systems, which are classically viewed as two complex and distinct entities.

In CXC (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`) chemokines (see figure, part a), one amino acid separates the first two
cysteine residues (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC). Chemokines of this family are known to chemoattract neutrophils, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. In CC (also known as β) chemokines (see figure, part b), the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other. Members of this chemokine family chemoattract monocytes, macrophages, basophils, T lymphocytes and eosinophils, but have little or no effect on neutrophils. The C (also known as γ) chemokine subfamily (see figure, part c) is distinguished structurally as containing only two of the four conserved cysteine residues that are found in the other families. The only members of this family are lymphotactin α and β (XCL1 and XCL2), which are known to chemoattract T lymphocytes. These chemokines are specific ligands for the XCR1 receptor. The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine subfamily, which is currently represented by a single member named fractalkine (CX3CL1), is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see figure, part d) - Rostene2007

although we focus on the two chemokines that have been extensively described in the CnS and for which the most data are avail- able, we also report on other chemokines that are active in the CnS. The chemokines that we mainly focus on belong to the two main chemokine families; they are the CC chemok- ine CCl2 (also known as monocyte chemoat- tractant protein 1 (mCP1)) and its cognate receptor, CCr2, and the CXC chemokine CXCl12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)) and its receptor in rodents (which is, as far as is known to date, unique in these species), CXCr4. - Rostene2007

Interestingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of a chemokine and its receptor (see below and FIG. 1) overlap in many regions in the normal adult brain. This suggests that these chemokines, through the action on specific GPCrs, might be involved in local neuronal communication.

The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission. 
Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release [@limatola_2000, @ragozzino_2002], modulate the functional properties of ionic channels [@lax_2002, @oh_2002] and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes [@lax_2002]. 
In addition, the chemokine system can alter the actions of neuronally active pharmacological agents such as opioids and the cannabinoid system [@heinisch_2011]. 
Moreover, chemokine receptor knockout mice (CCR6, CCR7, CXCR5) have recently been shown to exhibit behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes of relevance to psychiatric disorders, which suggests their essential role in physiological conditions [@harrison_2014, @jaehne_2014, @stuart_2014].

In this thesis, CXCL12 and CX3CL1 and their receptors (CXCR4, CXCR7, CX3CR1) have been investigated, as they are both expressed constitutively, even in physiological conditions, throughout the CNS [@banisadr_2002a, @hesselgesser_1999, @schonemeier_2008].




While higher inflammatory and pathophysiological levels of cytokines are implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegeneration diseases, it is now equally evident that, within the CNS, cytokines, including the chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines), mediate physiological signaling functions far beyond and independent of their traditional roles in inflammation and disease (Hopkins and Rothwell, 1995; Rothwell and Hopkins, 1995; Reichenberg et al.,2001; Pollmächer et al.,2002;Wilson et al.,2002; Adler and Rogers, 2005; Adler et al., 2006; McAfoose and Baune, 2009; Hoshiko et al., 2012; Williamson and Bilbo, 2013). In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;) have all been implicated in cardinal cellular and molecular processes of long- term hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation including synaptic plasticity, synaptic scaling and neurogenesis (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2007a,b; Turrigiano, 2007; Baier et al., 2009; McAfoose and Baune, 2009; Bachstetter et al., 2011; Ben Menachem-Zidon et al., 2011; Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011; del Rey et al., 2013; Gemma and Bachstetter, 2013). For example at physiological levels, IL-1 promotes long-term poten- tiation (LTP), a widely employed electrophysiological model of memory-associated synaptic plasticity, whereas IL-6 appears to exert inhibitory influences on excessive excitation during LTP maintenance (Li et al., 1997; Coogan et al., 1999; Ross et al., 2003; Balschun et al., 2004). Interestingly, production of both IL-1 and IL-6 is increased following LTP induction, further supporting a role for cytokines in modulating memory-associated synaptic plasticity and network-protective synaptic scaling (Schneider et al., 1998; Jankowsky et al., 2000). 
Several chemokines are widely expressed throughout the CNS during development and throughout life where they have been shown to play diverse roles in cell migration and differentiation (Lu et al., 2002), regulation of cellular communication in the adult brain (Tran and Miller, 2003) and neuroprotection (Araujo and Cotman, 1993; Meucci et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 1998; Bruno et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2000; Hatori et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Krathwohl and Kaiser, 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Catalano et al., 2013; Shepherd et al., 2013).  - Sheridan2014


Chemokines are key molecules in neuron-microglia communication in the developing and mature brain under both physiological and pathological conditions (de Jong et al., 2005). Fractalkine is an important neuron-microglia chemokine signal. - Pagani2015



Several chemokines are widely expressed throughout the CNS during development and throughout life where they have been shown to play diverse roles in cell migration and differentiation (Lu et al., 2002), regulation of cellular communication in the adult brain (Tran and Miller, 2003) and neuroprotection (Araujo and Cotman, 1993; Meucci et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 1998; Bruno et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2000; Hatori et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Krathwohl and Kaiser, 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Catalano et al., 2013; Shepherd et al., 2013). - Sheridan2014

An increasing number of chemokines exhibit extensive regulation across a range of situations where neuronal plasticity is involved; including memory-associated functional plasticity, protective plasticity in the setting of ischemia and maladaptive plasticity such as that underpinning neuropathic pain (Adler et al., 2006; Rostene et al., 2007; McAfoose and Baune, 2009; Old and Malcangio, 2012). Specifically, the role for CX3CL1 in control of hippocampus and Raphe activity suggests that infection-, inflammation-, and/or chronic disease-associated increases in the chemokine could contribute to reduced hippocampal and Raphe output, alterations that could, in turn, precipitate depressed mood and heightened anxiety among other disorders of brain function (Meltzer, 1990; Bast, 2011; Small et al., 2011).- Sheridan2014

<!--better written and citations Under those conditions, many chemokines are synthesized in activated astrocytes and microglial cells, suggesting their involvement in CNS defense mechanisms (Biber et al. 2007, Harrison and Lukacs 2007, Meucci 2010, Ransohoff et al. 1993) as well as in monocyte recruitment and migration into the CNS (Ransohoff 2009), (Semple et al. 2010) 

Chemokines are involved in virtually all pathologies that present an inflammatory component including nervous system disorders, such as neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory diseases. 
Under such conditions, a large number of chemokines and chemokine receptors are induced in activated astrocytes and microglia, suggesting their involvement in the activation of the CNS defense mechanisms [23,60,84,109]. -->

Chemokines are small pro-inflammatory cytokines with chemoattractant and regulatory activities ( Baggiolini, 1998 ). Chemokines are important regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, which largely explains how they contribute to controlling inflammatory processes in the brain. Indeed, in pathological processes, chemokines represent important neuro-inflammatory mediators that drive leukocytes traf fi cking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system ( Williams et al., 2014 ). However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions. Constitutive brain expression of chemokines and their receptors on endothelial cells, neurons and glia, suggests a role for such molecules in mediating homeostatic cross-talk between cells of the brain parenchyma ( Williams et al., 2014 ). The cross-talk among neurons and glia is determinant to establish and maintain a normal brain function. During brain development, chemokines represent signaling molecules that drive the correct migration and axonal pathfi nding of neuronal progenitor cells ( Tran and Miller, 2003 ):

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in  their sequences. Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa. They are subdivided into four  families (see figure), based on the number and spacing of the conserved cysteine residues in their  amino termini. These families are the CXC, CC, C and CX3C chemokines.  <!-- Rostene2007-->

Moreover, based on the spacing of its first two adjacent cysteine residues, the classification of chemokine family was made (@zlotnik_2000, see: Figure1):<!--  Variation in the two conserved 
cysteines closest to the N‐terminus of the mature proteins allows chemokines to be classified in four 
different subfamilies: XC, CC, CXC and CX3C, where X can be any amino acid.-->
C chemokines are characterized by the presence of only two cysteines, CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, and CX3C chemokines have three amino acids separating the cysteine pair. <!-- alternatively: They are classified into CXC, CC, C, or CX3C subclasses. --> 
These molecules were originally named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, in order to eliminate the confusion, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in the year 2000, which consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by “L” (ligand), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated [@zlotnik_2000].
A systematic nomenclature to name  the chemokines was introduced in 2000,  (Murphy et al., 2000; Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000).
Their subclass, followed by the letter L (denoting "ligand"), followed by a number indicating the chronological order of gene isolation. 


Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors (cCKRs) and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) . 
Conventional receptors belong to the superfamily of seven-membrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
They are classified according to the subfamily of chemokine they preferably bind and are named following the same principle as the chemokines, but replacing “L” by “R”, which denotes “receptor”. 
Most cCKRs belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR (Hughes and Nibbs, 2018).
Conventional receptors typically transduce their signals via Gi proteins and β‐arrestins, while the atypical receptors do not generally couple to G proteins and fail to induce typical transduction pathways activated by cCKRs.
 <!-- Based on the number of amino acids between the two cysteines at the amine end of the molecule, they are classified into four groups: XC, CC, CXC, and CX3C, where C is cysteine and X represents another amino acid [242].  Chemokines usually possess the conserved four cysteines and formation of disulfide bridges determines their three-dimensional structure (Figure 6).    -->
Chemokine receptors can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors (cCKRs) and
atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). A total of 22 chemokine receptors have been described to date
in humans, from which 4 are ACKRs. Conventional receptors are classified according to the subfamily

In addition to G protein-signaling pathways, a small subset of proteins expressing a high degree of homology with chemokine receptors <!--fails to activate them and -->signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018; @nibbs_2013]. 
These molecules are thus referred to as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) and presently include four members: ACKR1,  ACKR2,  ACKR3,  and  ACKR4. 

They are mainly thought to regulate inflammation by internalizing, scavenging, transporting, or buffering chemokines and thus modify their gradients [@nibbs_2013]. <!-- or controlling chemokine gradient formation [].

These ACKRs are emerging as   crucial regulatory components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental,   physiological and pathological contexts. 

--> 

However, in the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate, and to date,<!-- the best-characterized function is neuroinflammation [@salvi_2017]. 
To date, --> the only member of the atypical receptor family that is expressed under physiological conditions is ACKR3, previously known as CXCR7 (@meyrath_2020; @fumagalli_2020; @banisadr_2016; @schnemeier_2008; @gttle_2010, see: Table1, Figure 2C).
Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, ACKR3 is well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013].
As its mechanisms of activation bridge many features mentioned in this section, it will be described later in detail.

<!-- @fumagalli_2020 - ACKR3 (previously called CXCR7) expressed in HEK293T cells recruits the gap junction protein Connexin 43 (Cx43). Cx43 and ACKR3 are co-expressed in mouse brain astrocytes and human glioblastoma cells and form a complex in embryonic mouse brain. Functional in vitro studies show enhanced ACKR3 interaction with Cx43 upon ACKR3 agonist stimulation. Furthermore, ACKR3 activation promotes β-arrestin2- and dynamin-dependent Cx43 internalization to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication in primary astrocytes. These results demonstrate a functional link between ACKR3 and gap junctions that might be of pathophysiological relevance.--><!-- CXCR7 as an example of scavenger receptor that shows biased signaling ? 
CXCR7 is an interesting atypical chemokine receptor (Maksym et al., 2009). 
Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, CXCR7 is conserved well across the vertebrate species including sea lamprey (Nomiyama et al., 2011). 
It binds CXCL11 and CXCL12. 
Importantly, CXCR7 can heterodimerize with CXCR4 and modulate the effect of CXCL12 on CXCR4. 
Furthermore, CXCR7 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways (Maksym et al., 2009). 
During embryogenesis, CXCR7 is necessary for proper migration of primordial germ cells to CXCL12 via CXCR4 by acting as a sink for CXCL12 (Boldajipour et al., 2008). 
CXCR7 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007). 
Although poorly expressed in normal adult tissues, CXCR7 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors and tumor-associated vessels and appears to promote tumor growth and neoangiogenesis partly by signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Maksym et al., 2009). --><!-- However, in the CNS, the role of  ACKRs  seems  to  be  more  complex  than  the  simple  control  of  inflammation. --><!-- are uni  -  fied by their ability to degrade chemokines.

A certain group of chemokine receptors, known as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) [16] , have been proposed to act mainly as chemokine ligand scavengers [17,18] . Furthermore, under certain circumstances the G protein-coupled chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to become uncoupled from G protein signaling. Therefore, expression of a certain chemokine receptor does not always imply a contribution to the disease state. In fact, one might speculate that a pharmacological blockade of these receptors can increase free chemokine levels and therefore result in enhanced pathology. 

It should be noted that the ACKRs [16] such as ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)) can bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1. These receptors were initially regarded as nonsignaling decoy receptors because of their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways, and therefore ACKRs were proposed to only scavenge ligands or function as co-receptors [17] . However, some recent studies have shown that these ACKRs can signal predominantly through b -arrestins. 

These molecules structurally resemble conven  -  tional chemokine receptors but cannot initiate classical   chemokine receptor signaling responses to ligand bind  -  ing  3  ,  4  . They are thus referred to as atypical chemokine   receptors (ACKRs). 

Recently, a small subset of chemokine receptors, now identified as “atypical  chemokine  receptors”  (ACKRs),  has  been  described.  These  receptors  lack classic GPCR signaling and chemotactic activity and are believed to limit inflammation through their ability to scavenge chemokines at the inflammatory sites.

ACKRs represent a small subset of proteins expressing high degree of homology with chemokine receptors. 
Since ACKRs lack structural domains required for proper Gai signaling, they are unable to activate canonical G protein-dependent receptor signaling and chemotactic functions (Bachelerie et al., 2014a,b). 
At the moment, the ACKR family includes four proteins,  namely  ACKR1,  ACKR2,  ACKR3  and  ACKR4. Other two proteins, namely CCRL2 and PITPNM3 have been provisionally included with the name of ‘‘Ackr5’’ and ‘‘Ackr6’’, respectively, but they still need formal approval (Bachelerie et al., 2014b). In the last few years, the role of ACKRs is gradually clarifying since they were shown to regulate inflammation acting as scavenger receptors, promoting chemokine  transcytosis  or  regulating  chemokine  gradient formation (Mantovani et al., 2001; Nibbs and Graham, 2013; Bachelerie et al., 2014a,b; Bonecchi and Graham, 2016). The role of ACKRs in neuroinflammation is described below and summarized in Table 1.// @collins_2017 alone. CXCL14 did not activate CXCR4-expressing cells (i.e.,failed to trigger chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization, as well as signalingviaERK1/2 and the small GTPase Rac1); however, CXCL14 bound to CXCR4 withhigh affinity, induced redistribution of cell-surface CXCR4, and enhanced HIV-1 infection by>3-fold. We postulatethat CXCL14 is a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4 that enhances the potency of CXCR4 ligands.-->

Complicating these levels of regulation is the fact that overall protein synthesis rates are high in the young brain, decline through adulthood, and fall sharply with old age [13], [56]. Protein turnover in the brain appears to follow a similar pattern [13]; however, little is known about the effects of age on other protein modifications. In addition, proteins such as GFAP show increased metabolic turnover with age, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. Our results are consistent with independent regulation of chemokine expression at the mRNA and post-translational levels.

Protein expression and/or production is controlled by gene regulation, mRNA, and protein synthesis, which are considered relatively slow processes. 
As brain cells often need to quickly respond to their quickly changing microenvironment, these mechanisms may not be indispensable for chemokine coordination of homeostatic brain functions. 
Therefore, tight and rapid control of chemokine system signaling is highly required and can be achieved by several chemokine-induced signaling mechanisms.

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now starting to appreciate the extent and complexity of these mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling.

Transport of     chemokines   inside cells occurs     via   the canonical protein trafficking pathway associated with endoplasmic reticulum and   Golgi     [6]  .   Overall  , the secretion of chemokines varies vas  tly between cell types   and   activation stimuli   and can involve a myriad of secretory pathways, including secretory   granules and vesicles   [2, 5, 6]  .
