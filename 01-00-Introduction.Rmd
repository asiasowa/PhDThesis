## Chemokines - introduction

### Brief history of chemokines {#history}

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 [@yoshimura_1987]. 
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) [@meucci_1998]. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? 
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system [@williams_2014].
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions.
These results suggest their brain-specific functions, such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. 
Indeed, mounting evidence illustrates that chemokine can act on cellular, synaptic, network, and behavioral levels (for a comprehensive review: @sowa_2021).
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis [@trettel_2020].

Chemokines and CKRs are expressed by healthy neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells, summarized in Table 1.
They are widely distributed in the CNS and involved in many physiological brain functions, such as cell migration and differentiation, regulation of cellular communication, and neuroprotection [@adler_2005].<!--Several chemokines are widely expressed throughout the CNS during development and throughout life where they have been shown to play diverse roles in cell migration and differentiation (Lu et al., 2002), regulation of cellular communication in the adult brain (Tran and Miller, 2003) and neuroprotection (Araujo and Cotman, 1993; Meucci et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 1998; Bruno et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2000; Hatori et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Krathwohl and Kaiser, 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Catalano et al., 2013; Shepherd et al., 2013). - Sheridan2014--><!-- In physiological conditions, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling is involved in different neural functions both in development (participation in functional maturation of neuronal circuits driving cell positioning) and adulthood (regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions) [@lauro_2015]. zmienić -->
As delineated, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS.
Thus, these may lead to co-localization of chemokine and its corresponding receptors within the same cells, raising the possibility of autocrine signaling and complex cross-talks between different types of cells. <!-- Interestingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of a chemokine and its receptor ///(see below and FIG. 1)inne odwołania do figur i nie wiem czy uznawać// overlap in many regions in the normal adult brain. 
This suggests that these chemokines, through the action on specific GPCRs, might be involved in local neuronal communication. --> 
In this subchapter, I will briefly describe the expression of chemokine axes (CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3) investigated in this thesis in the central nervous system, focusing on their local communication between different cell types. <!-- alternatively : involvement in neuro-glial communication? -->

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively, as they are expressed in the brain under non-inflammatory, basal conditions. 

### Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors {#classification}

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized [@hughes_2018]. 
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet on which a C-terminal `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix is folded (for review:  @miller_2017).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop<!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: @kleist_2016). 
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction -->

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting "ligand"), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (@zlotnik_2000, see Figure \@ref(fig:family)).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part a). <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, --> 
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:family), part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.  
The CX3C (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part d). 

(ref:family) **Classification of chemokines and chemokine receptors**. **a** Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus.

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). 
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains.
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R”, which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure \@ref(fig:family)). 
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR [@hughes_2018].<!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... -->

Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011). <!-- The     binding     of     the     ligand     on     the     appropriate     chemokine     receptor     promotes     structural     changes     on     its     cytoplasmic     loops     and     tail, which     catalyze     the     exchange     of     GDP     with     GTP     on     the     alpha     subunit of     the     heterotrimeric     G     protein   [10]  .     The          and    betagamma     subunits     then dissociate     and     bind     to     cellular     effector     enzymes     that     generate     second     messengers     as     cAMP     or     IP3,     which,     in     turn,     activate     distinct signaling     pathways,     leading     to     different     cellular     responses.  -->

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives [@bachelerie_2014; @salvi_2017], structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018].  
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation [@bachelerie_2014; @bonecchi_2016; @nibbs_2013]. 
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: @salvi_2017). 
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS <!--citations-->(see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)), along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter \@ref(behavior)). 

In addition, the classical, formulated in the mid-1900s classification, divided chemokines into inflammatory (or inducible) chemokines, whose expression is upregulated upon inflammation, and homeostatic chemokines, which display constitutive expression.
Several chemokines share both properties and have been called dual-function chemokines [@zlotnik_2012].
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic.
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors that bind homeostatic chemokines were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species [@nomiyama_2013], highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases.

As chemokines constitute a complex system, besides their function and signaling pathways are modulated *via* a broad array of factors, which are discussed below.
The figure \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms) illustrates most of these mechanisms, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.

### Chemokine signaling

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now beginning to appreciate the extent and complexity of the mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling (see for reviews: @eiger_2021; @hughes_2018; @zweemer_2014). 
They enable tight and rapid control of chemokine signaling and quick response by the chemokine system to the dynamic microenvironment.
These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications, dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors, dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and biased-signaling (see Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms)). <!-- ominięte (4)  diversity in signaling pathways after chemokine activation, -->

Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (@hughes_2018, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].

Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: @zlotnik_2000, @hughes_2018, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part b).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this section.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules [@zweemer_2014]. 

Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding properties or activating different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011]. 
Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs [@kleist_2016].
Moreover, increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them.
It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors.
Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression  [@lortatjacob_2009], along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication. 

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors (@zweemer_2014, @kleist_2016, see: Fig 2D).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished.<!-- based on??? -->  
Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, and their downstream elements, accordingly to cell-specific differences. 
Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts.
This type of bias is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.

Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal context. 

In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to list a few. 
A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.

CXCR4 receptor is a 'classical' chemokine receptor, which activates G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q/i~ signaling pathways, including PKC or (ERK) ½. As an atypical receptor, ACKR3 alone activates `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, leading to receptor internalization or scavenging.

As suggested recently [@odemis_2012], when ACKR3 is activated on neurons, it signals through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, but when it is activated on astrocytes, it recruits `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways. -->
