# Introduction

## Chemokines 

### Brief history of chemokines {#history}

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 [@yoshimura_1987]. 
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) [@meucci_1998]. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? 
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system [@williams_2014].
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions (see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)).
These results suggest their brain-specific functions, such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. 
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis [@trettel_2020].

### Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors {#classification}

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized [@hughes_2018]. 
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet on which a C-terminal `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix is folded (for review:  @miller_2017).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop<!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: @kleist_2016). 
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction -->

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting "ligand"), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (@zlotnik_2000, see Figure \@ref(fig:family)).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part a). <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, --> 
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:family), part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.  
The CX3C (also known as `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure \@ref(fig:family), part d). 

(ref:family) **Classification of chemokines and chemokine receptors**. **a** Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys – cysteine residue, X – amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines. Receptors for the CXC family are shown in violet, whereas receptors for the CC family are depicted in blue. In addition, the receptor for the C family is presented in yellow and the receptor for the CX3R family is shown in red. **b** Atypical chemokine receptors, their initial names, ligand selectivity, and crosstalk with classical chemokine receptors.

```


Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). 
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains.
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R”, which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure \@ref(fig:family)). 
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR [@hughes_2018].<!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... -->

Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011). <!-- The     binding     of     the     ligand     on     the     appropriate     chemokine     receptor     promotes     structural     changes     on     its     cytoplasmic     loops     and     tail, which     catalyze     the     exchange     of     GDP     with     GTP     on     the     alpha     subunit of     the     heterotrimeric     G     protein   [10]  .     The          and    betagamma     subunits     then dissociate     and     bind     to     cellular     effector     enzymes     that     generate     second     messengers     as     cAMP     or     IP3,     which,     in     turn,     activate     distinct signaling     pathways,     leading     to     different     cellular     responses.  -->

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives [@bachelerie_2014; @salvi_2017], structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins [@hughes_2018].  
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation [@bachelerie_2014; @bonecchi_2016; @nibbs_2013]. 
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: @salvi_2017). 
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS <!--citations-->(see Table \@ref(tab:chemoexpression)), along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter \@ref(behavior)). 

### Chemokine signaling

After two decades of research on this topic, we are now beginning to appreciate the extent and complexity of the mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling (see for reviews: @eiger_2021; @hughes_2018; @zweemer_2014). 
They enable tight and rapid control of chemokine signaling and quick response by the chemokine system to the dynamic microenvironment.
These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications, dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors, dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and biased-signaling (see Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms)). <!-- ominięte (4)  diversity in signaling pathways after chemokine activation, -->

Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (@hughes_2018, see: Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist [@hughes_2018].

Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: @zlotnik_2000, @hughes_2018, Fig. \@ref(fig:chemmechanisms), part b).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this section.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules [@zweemer_2014]. 

Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding properties or activating different signaling pathways [@salanga_2011]. 
Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs [@kleist_2016].
Moreover, increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them.
It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors.
Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression  [@lortatjacob_2009], along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication. 

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors (@zweemer_2014, @kleist_2016, see: Fig 2D).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished.<!-- based on??? -->  
Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, and their downstream elements, accordingly to cell-specific differences. 
Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts. 

CKRs may activate different intracellular pathways in a ligand- and cell-specific context (see: Fig. 2C). 
Chemokine receptors most often signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca^2+^ levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G~11~ or G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) ½, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B (NF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) (for reviews: @allen_2007, @rostne_2011).

<!-- (ref:chemmechanisms) **Molecular mechanisms of the chemokine system in the CNS.** **a** Post-translational modifications exemplified by CX3CL1 transmembrane form cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases into its soluble variant. **b** The chemokine family redundancy is exemplified by ACKR3, an atypical chemokine receptor, which binds two chemokines, CXCL11 and CXCL12. Besides the ACKR3 receptor, these two chemokines activate other chemokine receptors, namely CXCR3 and CXCR4, respectively. **c** Most chemokine receptors can form homo- and hetero-dimers. It is exemplified by the well-known CXCR4-ACKR3 complex. CXCR4 receptor is a 'classical' chemokine receptor, which activates G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q/i~ signaling pathways, including PKC or (ERK) ½. As an atypical receptor, ACKR3 alone activates `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, leading to receptor internalization or scavenging. However, after heterodimerization with CXCR4, it can modify ligand binding properties and receptor signaling as well as intracellular trafficking. **d** Chemokine bias signaling occurs when specific chemokines could preferentially activate different intracellular pathways, either G-protein or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin, although binding to the same receptor. It can be due to a specific ligand or receptor, as exemplified here, due to a specific cell. 
As suggested recently [@odemis_2012], when ACKR3 is activated on neurons, it signals through `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways, but when it is activated on astrocytes, it recruits `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin-mediated pathways. -->

In addition, the classical, formulated in the mid-1900s classification, divided chemokines into inflammatory (or inducible) chemokines, whose expression is upregulated upon inflammation, and homeostatic chemokines, which display constitutive expression.
Several chemokines share both properties and have been called dual-function chemokines [@zlotnik_2012].
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic.
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors that bind homeostatic chemokines were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species [@nomiyama_2013], highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases.

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively, as they are expressed in the brain under non-inflammatory, basal conditions. 

#### CX3CL1/ CX3CR1 {#cx3cl1str}

CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` family [@pan_1997]. <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.-->
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997].<!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--><!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids [@zlotnik_2012]. 
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) *via* the action of several proteases [@bajetto_2001a; @schulte_2007]. <!--(for example: @schulte_2007)(Garton et al., 2001).-->
These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17<!--TACE?-->, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS)<!--(TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme)-->, acting both in the periphery and the CNS [@clark_2007; @cook_2010; @garton_2001; @hundhausen_2003; @jones_2013].
While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration [@ransohoff_2009]. 
Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a G~i~-protein-coupled receptor [@imai_1997].  
The subunit G~i~ inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a variety of intracellular second messengers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) [@alaoukaty_1998; @chandrasekar_2003]. 
These molecules are known for regulating a wide range of cellular functions,  including apoptosis,  proliferation,  transcription, and migration. <!-- regulates  apoptotic,  proliferative,  transcriptional  and  migratory functions  in  microglia-->

#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 {#cxcl12str}

CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily.
In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`,  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B5")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C6")`), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa [@yu_2006]. 
The `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one [@yu_2006].
Hence, as used here, the term "CXCL12" refers to the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation.  
It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. <!-- citation i trochę zmienić...-->
However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological processes [@britton_2021]. <!-- zmienić trochę --> 
CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet held in close apposition to an `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation [@murphy_2007; @wu_2010].
CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7.
All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013; @nomiyama_2015].
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 [@balabanian_2005]. 

Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, in addition to the enhancement of receptor-ligand binding, there is a subsequent GDP exchange for GTP, and the trimeric G~i~-protein dissociates into its constituent parts,  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ and G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`~ [@ganju_1998]. 
These molecules activate several intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review: @britton_2021, @ward_2006).  
PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). <!-- /// In parallel, CXCR4-oriented migration is mediated by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which can be activated by both G`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` and G `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` subunits [45]. -->
IP3 production leads to increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). 
Both intracellular free calcium and PKC promote the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and proliferation.  
In parallel, the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~i~ subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase and a consequent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in cell cycle entry and proliferation [@cheng_2015]. 
In addition to the well-characterized coupling to  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~, convincing evidence illustrates that CXCR4 can also bind to other G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~ proteins such as G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~, G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`o~, and G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`s~ (for a comprehensive review: @pozzobon_2016).
For example, by binding to G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~, CXCR4 leads to Rho activation, whereas  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ signal through Rac activation. 
Moreover, it is well documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal pathway.

Following CXCR4 activation, G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are recruited, inducing the intracellular C-terminal domain phosphorylation, which, in turn, results in `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins recruitment. 
These molecules result in the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and subsequent receptor internalization. 
Moreover, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins were reported to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CXCR4, leading to receptor downregulation and trafficking to endosomal compartments [@denies_2019]. 

CXCL12 second receptor, ACKR3, contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs<!--see figure...-->, similar to the other ACKRs [@thelen_2008].
It is thought to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation [@thelen_2008].

Like other atypical receptors, ACKR3 was demonstrated to (i) fail to activate G proteins and subsequent Ca^2+^-induced chemotaxis [@burns_2006; @levoye_2009; @rajagopal_2010a], (ii)  sequester CXCL12 extracellular gradient and thus control CXCR4-mediated cell migration. 
ACKR3's signaling pathways are discussed later in section "Biased Signaling" \@ref(biasedsignaling).

#### Summary

In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to list a few. 
A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.
