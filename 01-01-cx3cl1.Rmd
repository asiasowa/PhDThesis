## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 {#CX3CL1}

### CX3CL1 structure {#CX3CL1str}
CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` family [@pan_1997]. <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.--><!-- Fractalkine is the only member of the CX3C chemokine family and, unlike many other chemokines, shares a one-to-one  relationship  with  its  cognate  receptor, CX3CR1 [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997]. -->
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997].<!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--><!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids [@zlotnik_2012]. 
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) *via* the action of several proteases (@bajetto_2001a; @schulte_2007, see Section \@ref(chemosignal)). <!--(for example: @schulte_2007)(Garton et al., 2001).--><!-- The full-length molecule is also larger than most other chemokines, containing approximately 373 amino acid residues compared to the more common 70–80 amino acid size. // The 95 kDa full-length protein is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of  N-terminal chemokine domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane region and an intracellular C- terminal domain. It is converted to a soluble form on cleavage from the plasma membrane, through the action of metalloproteinases  (ADAM 10 and ADAM17 on leukocytes) (Hundhausen et al., 2003) or  cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) which is expressed and released by microglial cells in the spinal cord (Clark et al., 2007; Meucci et al., 2000; Ransohoff, 2002).The approximately 70 kDa soluble N-terminal chemokine domain can be released from the full-length protein via the action of several metalloproteinases such as cathepsin S, ADAM10, and ADAM17 (TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme) in both the periphery and CNS (Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2013).  --><!-- FKN is a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal chemokine domain attached to a long, highly glycosylated mucin-like stalk with a short membrane-spanning domain and intracellular domain. 
FKN can be cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10, ADAM 17, and cathepsin S to generate a soluble fragment [2–4] (Fig.1).  Both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of FKN are capable of signaling through CX3CR1, although there may be differences in affinity and biological activity between these two ligands [1]. In the periphery, membrane-bound FKN can promote adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, and the soluble ligand can cause chemotaxis of monocytes, T cells, and natural killer cells [51,52]. 
Genetic ablation of FKN causes reduced monocyte survival and reduced ability of CX3CR1+macrophages to sense the gut lumen [53]. Expression of the chemokine domain of FKN was sufficient to rescue survival of certain populations of monocytes @finneran_2019-->
These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17<!--TACE?-->, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS)<!--(TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme)-->, acting both in the periphery and the CNS [@clark_2007; @cook_2010; @garton_2001; @hundhausen_2003; @jones_2013].
While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration [@ransohoff_2009]. <!-- tutaj też dodać o soluble vs membrane-archored? -->

### CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling {#CX3CL1signal}
Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a G~i~-protein-coupled receptor [@imai_1997].  
The subunit G~i~ inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a variety of intracellular second messengers including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BA")`B) [@alaoukaty_1998; @chandrasekar_2003]. 
These molecules are known for regulating a wide range of cellular functions,  including apoptosis,  proliferation, and transcription. <!-- regulates  apoptotic,  proliferative,  transcriptional  and  migratory functions  in  microglia--><!--CX3CR1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through the Gq pathway, in turn  activating  PI-3  kinase  pathway  [@lyons_2009]. @finneran_2019 -->

### CX3CL1/CX3CR1 expression {#CX3CL1expr}

<!-- FKN  is expressed in neurons and peripheral endothelial and its receptor is produced by myeloid cells (including microglia), T cells, and natural killer cells [49,50].  Finneran 2019-->
In the brain, CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, are widely distributed in the CNS, including hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus [@harrison_1998; @tarozzo_2003]. <!-- Moreover, unlike most chemokines, CX3CL1 is constitutively expressed in the CNS with particularly high levels in forebrain structures, including hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus (Harrison et al., 1998; Tarozzo et al., 2003). --><!-- In the brainstem, a few scattered cells immunoreactive for fractalkine were initially depicted by Tarozzo and colleagues, while significant expression of the protein was subsequently observed in situ (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya et al., 2012).CX3CL1 is highly expressed on hippocampal neurons in the post-natal and adult rat and declines in old age which has been linked to cognitive decline in rodents (Lyons et al., 2009).///The high basal level of CX3CL1 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus is suggestive of a physiological, non- inflammatory function.///Fractalkine is constitutively expressed at high levels by neurons, mostly in forebrain structures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum and thalamus, but also in the olfactory bulb, with almost no expression in the cerebellum, at the mRNA and protein levels in adult mouse in situ (Tarozzo et al., 2003).--> 
Besides the well-documented neuronal expression of CX3CL1, a handful of studies also revealed its presence in astrocytes, albeit at lower levels (for instance: @sunnemark_2005). <!-- Besides neuronal expression of CX3CL1, few studies also detected its transcript and protein level in astrocytes, albeit at lower levels (Hulshof et al., 2003; Sunnemark et al., 2005) -->
However, the expression pattern of CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, in the CNS, remains controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia [@tarozzo_2003; @cardona_2006], whereas several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons [@hatori_2002; @heinisch_2009; @hughes_2002; @limatola_2005; @maciejewskilenoir_1999; @meucci_1998; @meucci_2000; @ruchaya_2012; @ruchaya_2014; @tarozzo_2003; @verge_2004; @zhuang_2007].<!-- However, the cell type expression pattern of CX3CR1 in the CNS remains controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia [@tarozzo_2003; @cardona_2006 (Bachstetter et al., 2011; Zhan et al., 2014)], whereas several studies report CX3CR1 expression on neurons in vitro as well as in brain regions, including the hippocampus, raphe nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum and thalamus (Meucci et al., 1998, 2000; Maciejewski- Lenoir et al., 1999; Hatori et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2002; Tarozzo et al., 2003; Verge et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007; Heinisch and Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya et al., 2012, 2014).  CX3CL1, also named fractalkine, is produced almost exclusively by neurons under physiological conditions (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011).-->
Thus, although predominantly expressed by microglia, CX3CR1 is also documented to be present on neuronal membranes, at least in pathological conditions.

In the  CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, the CX3CR1 receptor   gene   has   been   replaced   by   a   green   fluorescent protein   (GFP)   reporter  [@jung_2000].
Considering CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression, this genetic strain is one of the most important tools for studying the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation [@paolicelli_2014]. <!-- provides the most studied model to investigate the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation.-->
Thus, this model resulted in an  extensive body of evidence, highlighting the key role of CX3CL1 signaling in regulating a broad spectrum  of aspects of microglia functions, as discussed below. <!-- such as dynamic surveillance of the brain parenchyma and synaptic pruning [@cardona_2006; @jurgens_2012]. /// The CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, where the CX3CR1 gene has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (Jung et al., 2000), is one of the most common tools for studying neuron-microglia interaction under physiological conditions ((Lauro et al., 2006; Paolicelli et al.,2011)) see also: \@ref(micro_inter)).  --><!--The reason for it is that in this model all microglial cells abundantly express GFP, resulting in an exceptional fluorescent labeling of their complex arborization, from cell body to distal processes (Tremblay et al., 2010). Since the CX3CR1-GFP homozygous mice (CX3CR1KO/KO) are completely devoid of microglial CX3CR1, and therefore of fractalkine signaling, comparing the heterozygous (CX3CR1KO/+) used for imaging with the homozygous mice also provides a strategy for dissecting the molecular determinants of neuron-microglia communication in a non-invasive manner (Tremblay, 2011; Wolf et al., 2013). The CX3CR1-GFP heterozygous mice may be partially deficient in fractalkine signaling. Nevertheless, microglial morphology, dynamic surveillance (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Wake et al., 2009), dendritic spine turnover (Parkhurst et al., 2013), and microglial interactions with synaptic elements (Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010) were comparable in vivo between these CX3CR1-GFP heterozygous mice and the Iba1-GFP mice from Hirasawa and colleagues where CX3CR1 is not deleted (Hirasawa et al., 2005). - Paolicelli2014 --><!-- In physiological conditions, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling is involved in different neural functions both in development (participation in functional maturation of neuronal circuits driving cell positioning) and adulthood (regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions) [@lauro_2015]. zmienić --><!--Generation of a reporter mouse, replacing endogenous Cx3cr1 with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter under control of the Cx3cr1 promoter, demonstrated  that  CX3CR1  expression  is  restricted  to microglia in the CNS [@cardona_2006; @jung_2000].

### Microglia {#microglia}

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about 5–12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord [@szepesi_2018]. <!--ZMIENIĆ --><!--Microglia, traditionally known as resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play essential roles in brain circuit maturation during development, participating in the precise refinement of synaptic connections (Tremblay et al., 2010; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2012; Zhan et al., 2014). zmienić, Pagani2015--><!--Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, which represent about 5– 12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord.

Szepesi2018-->
They are derived from the myeloid precursors cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development (for a review, see: @prinz_2011).<!--zmienić // Microglial cells derive from myeloid lineage and colonize the immature brain during development, progressively acquiring a ramified morphology, commonly associated to surveying activity (Prinz and Mildner, 2011; Walker et al., 2014). Ramified microglia lie very close to each other and have highly motile filopodia-like protrusions of variable shape, defining rarely overlapping niches of competency (Raivich, 2005)., Pagani2015 // Microglia are derived from the myeloid precursors cells in the embryonic yolk sac and they travel to the area of the developing CNS during early embryogenesis (Schulz et al., 2012; Ginhoux et al., 2013; Kierdorf and Prinz, 2013; Ginhoux and Prinz, 2015;Wieghofer and Prinz, 2016; Hoeffel and Ginhoux, 2018). Microglial progenitors are already present around the neural tube at embryonic day 9 in mice, and from the fifth gestational week in humans. After neural entry, microglia progenitors migrate through the developing nerve tissue and undergo massive proliferation before they reach their final density (Ginhoux et al., 2010; Verney et al., 2010). Embryonic microglia develop into highly ramified mature microglia via regulatory factors such as Pu.1, IL-34, and CSF-1 (Schulz et al., 2012; Kierdorf et al., 2013). Szepesi2018// In recent years, microglia were demonstrated to originate from yolk-sac derived progenitors infiltrating the brain during early embryonic development, with no subsequent contribution to their renewal from bone-marrow derived myeloid cells (Ginhoux et al., 2010; Mizutani et al., 2012; Kierdorf et al., 2013).// Paolicelli2014-->
Finally, these glial cells are broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a review, see: @szepesi_2018).<!--poprawić trochę te zdanie--><!-- Microglia are broadly distributed throughout the CNS although quantity and location among species varies (Lawson et al., 1990; Mittelbronn et al., 2001). Despite their broad distribution, microglia represent a rather heterogeneous community with different subpopulation based on specific brain regions. Each microglia subpopulation develop unique features and they can be distinguished by capacities and functions (Gertig and Hanisch, 2014; Neiva et al., 2014; Doorn et al., 2015; Grabert et al., 2016; De Biase et al., 2017). Szepesi2018-->

Their roles include, but are not limited to,

LUB

Among their numerous functions, microglia is emerging as extremely dynamic in their once presumed “resting” state, continuously sampling the extracellular space and contacting pre- and post-synaptic elements with their highly motile processes (Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010). Paolicelli2014 <!-- Microglia were also shown to be extremely dynamic in their once presumed “resting” state, continuously surveying the brain parenchyma and contacting pre- and post-synaptic elements with their highly motile processes (Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010).

[@piirainen_2021]  Modification of local brain microenvironment can be sensed by microglia cells, which respond to preserve brain homeostasis, or to exacerbate brain damage. Lepore 2019--><!--Within the brain, microglia are plastic cells that constantly monitor brain parenchyma to sense local perturbation and, depending on specific environmental cues, can change their phenotype and functional activity promoting inflammatory or anti-inflammatory conditions (  1  ,  2  ).

Precisely, 

Their roles include, but are not limited to, a continuous surveillance, elimination of pathogens, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and cellular debris, and synapse remodeling and elimination, thereby contributing to maintaining tissue homeostasis under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions (Paolicelli et al., 2014; Reshef et al., 2014; Sierra et al., 2010). 

Moreover, it is well-known that microglia prune synapses at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sides, as well as control the elimination and maturation of synapses, and thereby regulate synaptic innervation [@paolicelli_2011; @schafer_2012]. <!-- bardziej zmienić // In recent years, it became evident that the so called “resting” microglia are fully active cells that participate to brain functions controlling pruning, elimination and maturation of synapses ( Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2012 ). Microglial cells play a role during development promoting programmed cell death and removing apoptotic neurons and glia ( Marín-Teva et al., 2004; In adult brain, microglia contribute to neurogenesis promoting neural precursor proliferation, neuroblast migration, and neuronal differentiation via the secretion of trophic factors ( Choi et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009; Ribeiro Xavier et al., 2015 ).Trettel 2020 /// In healthy and developing brains, microglia prune synapses at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sides and thus regulate synaptic innervation (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2012). // Recently, a crucial role for microglial autophagy in synaptic pruning has been demonstrated (Kim et al., 2017). The molecular cues that guide microglia to the synapses destined for engulfment remain to be identified, as do the specific mechanisms that are recruited. However, it is thought that the complement factors C1 and C3 ‘tag’ such synapses and thus direct the microglia to them for phagocytosis (Schafer et al., 2012; Bialas and Stevens, 2013). In addition, synaptic stripping, which is the physical separation of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements by intervening microglial processes, is well documented upon injury (Kettenmann et al., 2013). - Acharjee2018b---><!-- Given the role of microglia in regulating synapse number (Tremblay et al., 2011; Stephan et al., 2012; Schafer et al., 2013; Wuet al.,2013, 2015), ...-->


In addition, microglial interactions with synapses are important in maintenance of neuronal connections and affect neuronal plasticity (Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010a). 


Neural circuits are constantly monitored and supported by the surrounding microglial cells, using finely tuned mechanisms which include both direct contact and release of soluble factors. <!--Paolicelli2014-->
These bidirectional interactions are not only triggered by pathological conditions as a S.O.S. response to noxious stimuli, but they rather represent an established repertoire of dynamic communication for ensuring continuous immune surveillance and homeostasis in the healthy brain. <!--Paolicelli2014-->
In addition, recent studies are revealing key tasks for microglial interactions with neurons during normal physiological conditions, especially in regulating the maturation of neural circuits and shaping their connectivity in an activity- and experience-dependent manner. <!--Paolicelli2014-->
Chemokines, a family of soluble and membrane-bound cytokines, play an essential role in mediating neuron-microglia crosstalk in the developing and mature brain. <!--Paolicelli2014-->


<!--Their physiological roles discovered so far comprise the elimination of supernumerary neurons and the maturation of synapses in the developing brain (Hoshiko et al., 2012; Cunningham et al., 2013; Lenz et al., 2013; Ueno et al., 2013), the regulation of neuronal and synaptic activity (Li et al., 2012; Pascual et al., 2012), the elimination of apoptotic newborn neurons generated in excess during adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Sierra et al., 2010), and the activity- and experience-dependent remodeling of neuronal circuits. Paolicelli2014-->
Neuronal circuit plasticity is required for learning and memory processes in the developing and mature brain, where microglia contribute to both the formation and elimination of synapses (Tremblay et al., 2010, 2012; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2012; Parkhurst et al., 2013). <!--Paolicelli2014-->



##### duality

In this regard, the actions exerted by microglia on neurons have often been referred to as dual or even multifaceted (Sierra et al., 2013), given that both neuroprotective and detrimental actions have been reported. <!--ZMIENIĆ /// The same microglia phenotype triggers different effects on brain homeostasis, in a context-dependent way.--><!-- Growing evidence suggests a delicate balance between the protective and detrimental influence of microglial activation on neuron functionality (Sierra et al., 2013). Bolos2018 -->
Microglia show an extraordinary degree of plasticity, which allows them to rapidly switch between activation phenotypes and to adapt to everchanging neuron and environmental requirements. <!--ZMIENIĆ --> 
In this regard, a plethora of soluble and membrane-bound cytokines execute the orders of bi-directionally orchestrated neuron-microglia communication. <!--ZMIENIĆ -->
This bidirectional cross-talk governs the delicate equilibrium between the neuroprotective and detrimental actions of microglia on neurons. <!--ZMIENIĆ -->

Following acute brain damages, microglia cells at the site of injury produce anti-inflammatory cytokines,  scavenger  receptors,  and  trophic  factors  thus promoting restorative processes. However, later on, microglia acquire  a  pro-inflammatory  phenotype  releasing  proinflammatory  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  inducible  nitric oxide synthase, all involved in the exacerbation of brain damage (  37  ,  38  ). <!-- Lepore 2019 -->

Microglia are extremely plastic and microglial activation has been associated with specific morphologic changes; during activation, microglia retract their processes, resulting in decreased occupied area and increased soma size.9 - Yuan2020

Microglia can react rapidly to infection, trauma, and other danger signals, by retracting their processes and enlarging their cell body. 
However, microglial phenotypes vary depending on the type of stimulus and by brain region (Morrison and Filosa, 2013; Abiega et al., 2016). 
Genome-wide analyses of microglia of different CNS regions showed that cerebellar and hippocampal microglia exist in a more vigilant state than do microglia in other brain areas (Grabert et al., 2016). 
Even within the hippocampus, the microglia of area CA3 are more sensitive to LPS compared with those of CA1 or dentate gyrus (Madore et al., 2013). 
Thus, it is not surprising that we saw different effects in BLA compared with what another group reported in the striatum.;;

In damaged brain, microglial processes rapidly rearrange toward the site of injury (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008). <!--zmienić, Pagani2015-->
Among soluble factors activating microglial cells, ATP regulates microglial processes extention and ramification in both physiological and pathological conditions (Davalos et al., 2005; Inoue et al., 2007). <!--zmienić, Pagani2015--> 
To reach the site of activating stimuli, microglia retract their cellular processes and rearrange them in a directional manner toward the lesion. <!--zmienić, Pagani2015-->
In addition, a marked change in ionic channel expression has been observed (Boucsein et al., 2000). 
Indeed, in acute brain slices non-activated microglia frequently display a small linear conductance, while following nerve lesion (Boucsein et al., 2000) or status epilepticus (Avignone et al., 2008) they transiently express inward and outward rectifier potassium (K+) currents (Menteyne et al., 2009; Kettenmann et al., 2011). <!--zmienić, Pagani2015-->

Being equipped by numerous receptors and cell surface molecules microglia can perform bidirectional interactions with other cell types in the CNS. <!--Szepesi2018--> 
There is accumulating evidence showing that neurons inform microglia about their status and thus are capable of controlling microglial activation and motility while microglia also modulate neuronal activities. <!--Szepesi2018-->

##### ION CHANNELS

Ion channels have been involved in many microglial functional properties (Eder, 2005), such as cell volume regulation (Schlichter et al., 1996; Eder et al., 1998), proliferation (Kotecha and Schlichter, 1999), migration (Rappert et al., 2002; Schilling et al., 2004) and cell process extension and retraction (Eder et al., 1998). <!--zmienić, Pagani2015-->

How and what kind of microglia modulate synapses in the adult brain are still poorly known, particularly in adult animals, although previous studies have revealed evidences on synaptic phagocytosis or nibbling by neonate and adolescent microglia (Paolicelli [@piirainen_2020] /// Understanding the mechanisms of microglia communication in the brain is important to identify molecular players that can be used as targets to counteract brain damage and preserve brain homeostasis.

<!-- morphology and activation -->
Microglial morphology reflects their functional activation state (Zanier et al., 2015). In the unchallenged state, surveillant microglia present a ramified morphology, highly motile processes that interact with synapses, whereas upon “activation,” their processes typically retract as the cell body becomes hypertrophied (Tremblay et al., 2010a). “Activated” microglia are also well known to display an increased expression of IBA-1 in various contexts of injury and disease (Norden et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). We have previously shown that electron microscopy (EM) can reveal the functional state of microglia in a highly sensitive manner (Tremblay et al., 2010a). 
 
#### KO in microglia

In this regard, the impaired cross-talk between neurons and microglia is thought to be the underlying mechanism of other anatomical alterations found in CX3CR1-/- mice (Paolicelli et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2014). <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->

The first evidence of this phenomenon was provided by an elegant study by Paolicelli et al. (2011). <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->
These authors showed that CX3CR1-/- mice exhibit impairments in the positioning of microglia in the CA1 region during embryonic development. <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->
Thus, as a consequence of deficient synaptic pruning, CA1 pyramidal neurons show a postnatal transient increase in the number of synaptic spines (Paolicelli et al., 2011). <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->
This is a beautiful example of the bi-directional manner in which the system is regulated. <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->
The first evidence of a link between chemokines and dendritic spines was provided by Paolicelli et al. [@paolicelli_2011].

Deficient of CX3CR1 microglia displayed impairment in synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient deficit in excitatory synaptic transmission and a reduced synaptic density as compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties. 
These changes were present during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline, highlighting CX3CR1 impact on synaptic pruning during neurodevelopment.
However, these mice were also tested in similar experimental settings in their adulthood (P40) [@zhan_2014]. 
Interestingly, despite unchanged dendritic spine density, neurons from CX3CR1^-/-^ mice displayed a lower frequency of mEPSCs and sEPSCs in comparison to their wild-type littermates. 
These results illustrate that a transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic multiplicity, whereas the number of excitatory synapses remained the same [@zhan_2014].
These data support the idea of a critical window during which microglia-mediated synaptic pruning is crucial for proper circuit maturation.

Similarly, CX3CL1 impact on dendritic spines was documented investigating newborn cells. 
By using the same strain of mice, it was documented that adult transgenic animals displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with morphological changes, reflected as enlargement and shortening,  in adult-born granule neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) [@bols_2018]. 
Despite being ultrastructurally enlarged, synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality. <!-- lepiej, ale upewnić się -->

These results are nicely complemented by findings obtained by the following elegant study.
Specifically, adding microglial cells to the hippocampal neuronal culture results in an upregulation of excitatory synaptic currents together with a higher density of dendritic spines.
In contrast, microglial depletion from hippocampal organotypic cultures led to both reduction in the dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission [@ji_2013]. 
Moreover, in adult mice,  pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation was associated with the prevention of dendritic spine loss in obese mice [@cope_2018].
These findings strongly suggest that microglia are key players in the regulation of the dendritic spine density. 

In development, CX3CR1 deficient mice were  observed  to  have  delayed  synaptic  pruning. 
Microglial number was transiently reduced in Cx3cr1 −/− mice compared to wild-type controls while the number of dendritic spines was increased. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
This indicates that CX3CR1 deficiency may delay maturation of synapses by delaying engulfment during development [@paolicelli_2011]. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
In the adult brain, CX3CR1 has been identified as necessary for layer V cortical neuron survival [@ueno_2013].
These findings implicated FKN signaling in normal brain development and homeostasis but ablation of CX3CR1 also affects cognition.<!-- Finneran 2019-->


The data obtained in the present work support the notion that microglia are key regulators of granule neuron connectivity during adulthood. <!--zmienić,Bolos2018--> 
In this regard, we and others have demonstrated that chronic inflammation negatively regulates the connectivity and functional maturation of newborn granule neurons (Ekdahl et al., 2003; Llorens-Martin et al., 2014) and that several of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that are increased in CX3CR1-/- mice (such as IL-6, TNF$\alpha$ and Eotaxin, among others) impair the generation of newborn neurons (Villeda et al., 2011). <!--zmienić,Bolos2018-->

Accordingly, microglia of CX3CR1-/- mice show impaired migration during development (Pagani et al., 2015; Paolicelli et al., 2011), together with a partially activated phenotype during adulthood (Reshef et al., 2014). <!-- zmienić /// Bolos2018-->
In turn, these functions may alter synaptic plasticity and behavior. <!-- (see Sections: \@ref(LTP) and \@ref(learn), see Figure 4).--><!--rozbudować-->
For example<!-- In addition-->, a recent study demonstrated that the depletion of CX3CR1 might affect the ratio of microglial subpopulations (i.e., MCHII^+^ and CD206^+^), which positively correlated with morphological (microglial deramification) and behavioral changes (i.e., social submissiveness) changes [@piirainen_2021]. 

In animal models, knocking down CX3CR1 signaling exacerbated microglia over-activation, increasing the release of IL-1 β and apoptotic neuronal cell death in mice injected with LPS, and increased neuronal cell loss in PD and ALS mouse models ( Cardona et al., 2006 ). 
In cx3cl1 − / − mice, the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-mediated gene insertion of either soluble or membrane bound synthetic variant of CX3CL1 demonstrated that, in a MPTP- model of PD, only the soluble form rescued motor coordination, reduced neurodegeneration and microglia activation ( Morganti et al., 2012 ). 
A role for endogenous CX3CL1 in the attenuation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype was also reported in a mouse model of Tauopathy ( Lastres-Becker et al., 2014 ).
Recent data show that only the over-expression of a specific cleavage variant of the soluble CX3CL1 reduced Tau-pathology ( Finneran and Nash, 2019 ). 



Disruption of FKN signaling has deleterious effects on both neurogenesis and cognition.
Cx3cr1−/−mice were found to have a significant reduction in neurogenesis, which could be reversed by IL-1 receptor antagonist administration [@bachstetter_2011]. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
When behaviorally assessed, these mice were found to have motor learning impairments, spatial recall impairments, and fear-associated recall impairments. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
These cognitive impairments were associated with reduced synaptic plasticity. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Antagonism of IL-1β signaling successfully reversed hippocampal-dependent learning but not motor learning [63]. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Disruption of FKN signaling has also been studied in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.
In a seminal paper, Cardona et al. [12] described the impact of CX3CR1 knock out in several models of neurodegeneration. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Broadly, they found that microglia lacking CX3CR1 are cytotoxic in models of systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Mice lacking CX3CR1 were more susceptible to neuron loss upon systemic injection of LPS. 
Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Cx3cr1−/−microglia from LPS-challenged mice into wild-type mice also produced neurotoxicity in the area of the injection site. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Interestingly, microglia lacking CX3CR1 did not migrate away from the injection site whereas microglia with intact CX3CR1 signaling migrated from the injection site. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Inhibition of IL-1β signaling blocked the neurotoxic effects of and restored the migratory capacity of Cx3cr1−/− microglia. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Similarly, in the SODG93Amouse model of ALS, disruption of FKN signaling caused greater neuron loss, reduced hindlimb strength, and shortened lifespan. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
In a toxic model of PD, loss of FKN signaling by knocking out either the receptor or the ligand resulted in significantly greater neurotoxicity [12]. <!-- Finneran 2019-->

##### neurodevelopment

Disturbances were also present regarding CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pathway, which plays an essential role in neurodevelopment. 
Similar to CXCL12, the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis was demonstrated to affect the outgrowth of dopaminergic axons in the forebrain and the laminar positioning of subsets of cortical interneurons [@squarzoni_2014].
Moreover, CX3CR1 deficiency impairs the functional maturation of thalamocortical synapses in the developing barrel cortex, indicating crucial involvement of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in this process [@hoshiko_2012].
As the CX3CR1 receptor is mainly expressed by microglia, and those cells display a well-documented process of network maturation, called synaptic pruning, microglia are likely to participate in the maturation of synapses. 

#### History

In 2000, Zujovic et al. reported for the first time that exogenous CX3CL1 restrained LPS-microglia activation *in vitro*, whereas neutralization of endogenous CX3CL1 in hippocampal cultures increased the neurotoxic action on neuronal cells. <!-- zmienić In 2000, Zujovic et al. reported for the first time that exogenous CX3CL1 restrained LPS-microglia activation *in vitro*, and that neutralization of endogenous CX3CL1 in hippocampal cultures increased the neurotoxic action on neuronal cells. // Accordingly, *in vivo* neutralization of endogenous CX3CL1 potentiated LPS effects in the brain ( Zujovic et al., 2000 ). -->
Later, Mizuno et al. (2003) reported the reduction of IL-6, NO and TNFα production by microglia stimulated with LPS upon CX3CL1 treatment, and a reduced neuronal cell death. <!-- zmienić Later, Mizuno et al. (2003) reported the reduction of IL-6, NO and TNFα production by microglia stimulated with LPS upon CX3CL1 treatment, and a reduced neuronal cell death.  -->
Boehme et al. (2000) showed that CX3CL1 reduced FAS-mediated microglia cell death activating PI-3 kinase/PKB pathway, and modulating both the levels and the activation states of Bcl-2 family member proteins. 

Initially, the binding of CX3CL1 to its receptor CX3CR1 was believed to maintain microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state (Bachstetter et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016). <!-- it is believed that the binding of soluble CX3CL1 to its receptor CX3CR1 maintains microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state (Bachstetter et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016), although chemoattractant properties have been demonstrated for the membrane-bound form of CX3CL1 (Lauro et al., 2006; Song et al., 2013).-->
However, microglia activation is no longer considered an all or none event, but rather a sequence of progressive stages (Ponomarev et al., 2007; Olah et al., 2012; Crain et al., 2013) depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals in the surrounding environment (Biber et al., 2007; Lively and Schlichter, 2013).<!--zmienić, Pagani2015--> 


#### soluble vs membrane bound CX3CL1

it is believed that the binding of soluble CX3CL1 to its receptor CX3CR1 maintains microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state (Bachstetter et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016), although chemoattractant properties have been demonstrated for the membrane-bound form of CX3CL1 (Lauro et al., 2006; Song et al., 2013).

In cx3cl1 − / − mice, the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-mediated gene insertion of either soluble or membrane bound synthetic variant of CX3CL1 demonstrated that, in a MPTP- model of PD, only the soluble form rescued motor coordination, reduced neurodegeneration and microglia activation ( Morganti et al., 2012 ).

The unique transmembrane structure of CX3CL1 raises the possibility of additional functional regulation by altering its abundance at the cell surface. 
This could be accomplished in principle by changes in traffic between subcellular compartments. 
To analyze this possibility we examined the subcellular distribution of CX3CL1 in human ECV-304 cells stably expressing  untagged  or  green  fluorescent  protein tagged forms of the chemokine. 
CX3CL1 was present in two distinct compartments, diffusely on the plasma membrane and in a punctate juxtanuclear compartment. 
The latter shared some features with, yet was distinct from the conventional endocytic pathway and may represent a specialized recycling subcompartment. 
Accordingly, surface CX3CL1 was found to be in dynamic equilibrium with the juxtanuclear vesicular compartment. 
Intracellular CX3CL1 co-localized with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptor) proteins syntaxin-13 and VAMP-3. 
Cleavage of VAMP-3 by tetanus toxin or impairment of syntaxin-13 function by expression of a dominant-negative allele inhibited the ability of internalized CX3CL1 to traffic back to the plasma membrane. 
These data demonstrate the existence of a dynamic, SNARE-mediated recycling of CX3CL1 from the cell surface to and from an endomembrane storage compartment. 
The intracellular storage depot may serve as a source of the chemokine that could be rapidly mobilized by stimuli. [@liu_2005]

Importantly, neither of these phenotypes was altered by transgenic expression of the soluble CX3CL1 isoform, suggesting that it is the membrane-anchored version of CX3CL1 that regulates microglial phagocytosis of A and neuronal MAPT phosphorylation. 
Analysis of transcript levels in purified microglia isolated from APPPS1 mice with the various CX3CL1/CX3CR1 genotypes revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic markers, which was associated with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and A internalization within microglia. 
Together, these studies challenge the “frustrated phagocytosis” concept and suggest that neuronal–microglial communication link the two central AD pathologies. [Lee_2014]

#### Factors to induce CX3CL1 induction 

Recently it has been established in vitro and in vivo, that the acute activation of dorsal horn microglia by inflammaory insult or sciatic nerve impairments result in a release of CatS from microglia, which liberates FKN from dorsal horn of spinal cord neurons (Clark and Malcangio, 2012; Clark et al., 2010, 2009). 

There is some evidence that different fragments of the FKN ligand may have different functional outcomes. <!--finneran_2018-->
Fractalkine signaling has been implicated in neuropathic pain in spinal injury models [77–79]. 
In these studies, neuropathic pain in injury models was alleviated<!-- złagodzony--> by antibody antagonization of CX3CR1, and in non-injured rats neuropathic pain was induced by activation of CX3CR1 with intrathecal injections of exogenous fractalkine peptide comprising just the chemokine domain. 
Furthermore, Clark and Malcangio [15] show that infusion of this chemokine peptide of FKN (ckFKN, Fig.1) elicits mechanical allodynia, while infusion of sFKN (which contains the full mucin-like stalk, Fig.1) does not. 
They also demonstrate a difference in calcium mobilization upon binding between these two fragments. Interestingly, it has been identified that cathepsin S is necessary for the production of pain-inducing FKN in a spinal injury  model  [2,77].  
In  silico  analysis  of  substrate preference of cathepsin S indicates membrane-bound FKN as a potential substrate  (Biniossek et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2007; Jones et al. 2013; Ruckrich et al. 2006) and a recent study published that cathepsin S cleaves membrane bound FKN to generate a soluble fragment that migrates at  a  lower  apparent  molecular  weight  than  the ADAM10/17 cleavage product [83]. <!--finneran_2018-->
These data suggest that removal of the mucin-like stalk (either partially or in whole) may alter the microglial response to FKN, which can elicit different effects and/or microglial phenotypes depending on the identity of the soluble ligand.<!--finneran_2018-->

These data may indicate that the form of the  soluble  fragment  (with  or  without  the  mucin stalk) affects how the  chemokine signals  in these neurodegenerative models and that proteolytic cleavage could be a mechanism for regulation of fractalkine  activity  in  vivo.  
More  research  is  needed  to determine if there are differential effects of these soluble  FKN  variants  and  how  this  could  regulate neuroinflammation. <!--finneran_2018-->


CX3CR1 signaling has been shown to influence microglial function under both normal and pathological conditions (Limatola and Ransohoff, 2014; Paolicelli et al., 2014).
For example, a transient reduction of microglial density during hippocampal development has been reported in Cx3cr1 knockout mice (Paolicelli et al., 2011). 
However, previous studies examining microglia ramification did not evidentiate morphological differences (Liang et al., 2009; Hoshiko et al., 2012), 

#### Microglia and adenosine

The high basal level of CX3CL1 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus is suggestive of a physiological, non-inflammatory function. Indeed, there is mounting evidence which implicates both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Piccinin et al., 2010; Maggi et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011; Roseti et al.,2013; Scianni et al.,2013). For example, CX3CL1 has been shown to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and post-synaptic glutamate currents (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005). The latter effect has been linked to increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit (Ragozzino et al., 2006). These synaptic effects are consistent with a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons most likely exerted through the CX3CR1 receptor, which is reportedly expressed on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Meucci et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2005). Overall, previous studies indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, perhaps as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006; Turrigiano, 2008; Piccinin et al., 2010). Consistent with this hypothesis, neuroprotective ADAM17-mediated increase in in soluble CX3CL1 is observed in multiple settings of glutamatergic neurotransmission where the chemokine is suggested to performa neuroprotective function (Chapman et al., 2000; Tsou et al., 2001; Erichsen et al., 2003; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2010; Pabon et al., 2011). -Sheridan2014

In hippocampal cultures, CX3CL1 reduced neuronal cell death due to gp120- or glutamate overexposure ( Meucci et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2005 ). <!-- zmienić -->
Microglial cells treated with CX3CL1 release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection in mixed hippocampal neuron – glia cultures. <!-- zmienić -->
Among them adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection through the activation of adenosine A1 receptor subtype (A1R) ( Lauro et al., 2008, 2010 ). <!-- zmienić -->
Acting on microglia, CX3CL1 indirectly modulates the activity of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) on astrocytes, with higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and this effect requires the function of A1R ( Catalano et al., 2013 ). <!-- zmienić -->
In a pMCAO rat model, i.c.v. injection of soluble CX3CL1, 30 min after ischemia, has long lasting protective effects, reducing lesion volume and neurological deficits, again with the involvement of active A1Rs ( Cipriani et al., 2011).<!-- zmienić --><!-- CX3CL1 is neuroprotective against Glu-induced excitotoxicity, with mechanisms fully dependent on A1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and in part dependent on A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014). 
CX3CL1 also protects neurons against NMDA-induced death (Deiva et al., 2004), but no evidence of ARs involvement are reported  so  far. @lauro_2014-->

CX3CL1-mediated neuroprotection and neuromodulation may also require the activity of adenosine-type 2 a receptors (A2ARs). <!-- zmienić -->
Scianni et al. (2013) demonstrated that CX3CL1 modulates the NMDA glutamate receptor function and that this effect involves the release of D-serine from glial cells, and the activity of A2AR subtype. <!-- zmienić -->
Altogether these data describe a mechanism by which CX3CL1, via A2AR and D-serine, and likely modulating synaptic NR2A/NMDARs, induced CREB phosphorylation, upregulation and release of BDNF, resulting in neuroprotection and neuromodulation ( Lauro et al., 2015). <!-- zmienić -->

In the hippocampus, a region crucial for cognition, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce the amplitude of both synaptic [@ragozzino_2006] and AMPA-evoked currents <!--with a mechanism that involves inhibition of forskolin-induced Ser-845 GluR1 phosphorylation-->[@ragozzino_2006; @lauro_2008], suggesting a postsynaptic mechanism.
These effects are probably a result of a PKA-related phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845 [@ragozzino_2006]. <!-- of CX3CR1? // with a mechanism that involves inhibition of forskolin-induced Ser-845 GluR1 phosphorylation -->
Further investigations revealed that CX3CL1 did not act directly on postsynaptic neurons, but instead this chemokine activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine. 
The presence of this molecule<!--?-->led to the inhibition of the glutamatergic transmission by its receptors, adenosine A3 receptor (A~3~R), and to the lesser extend adenosine A1 receptor (A~1~R)  (@lauro_2008, @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010, see: Fig4B).<!--At Schaffer's collateral-CA1 pyramidal neurons CX3CL1 depresses AMPA-mediated currents with a mechanism that involves inhibition of forskolin-induced Ser-845 GluR1 phosphorylation ( Ragozzino et al., 2006 ), whereas it enhances NMDA-mediated neurotransmission *via* adenosine A2A subtype activation and D-serine release by glial cells ( Maggi et al., 2009; Scianni et al., 2013 ). 
In the same area it has been reported that: i) CCL2 exerts pre-synaptic effects increasing the release of glutamate onto CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Zhou et al., 2011 ); ii) CXCL16 enhances both the release of glutamate and GABA, requiring adenosine type 3 receptor (A3R) and microglia activation ( Di Castro et al., 2016 ).  /// zmienić Trettel 2020-->  

Adenosine is an endogenous modulator of brain functions  with increasingly evident actions on synaptic transmission [@ribeiro_2010] or glia [@boison_2010], which acts by binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes (A~1~, A~2A~, A~2C~, A~3~) and alter neurotransmitter release probability [@verkhratsky_2009]. <!-- Adenosine is a metabolite that acts through different receptor subtypes (Jacobson and Gao, 2006); among them A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we  previously  demonstrated  that  CX3CL1  triggers  the  release of  adenosine  from  neuronal  and  microglial  cells  (Lauro  et  al., 2008,  2010). //  Gliotransmitters include adenosine triphosphate, which, when converted to adenosine, acts on presynaptic adenosine receptors to alter neurotransmitter release probability and short-term plasticity.-->
In the hippocampus, adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in these cells, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure [@piccinin_2010]. <!-- poprawić ... -->
Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) in the blockade of A~1~R and A~3~R receptors [@piccinin_2010]. 

CX3CL1 was also shown to trigger D-serine, a NMDAR co-agonist, release from glial cells, and potentiate NMDAR function in an A~2A~- and D-serine-dependent manner, which was driven by microglial cells [@scianni_2013]. <!-- okropne zdanie...-->
Therefore, the CX3CL1-induced adenosine release may affect glutamatergic neurotransmission by a mechanism involving a combination of three different AR subtypes and both glutamatergic receptors. 
Nevertheless, the opposite effects of CX3CL1 on AMPAR and NMDAR functions are nicely correlated with the difference between A~3~R/A~1~R and A~2A~R receptors.
Moreover, the depressed glutamatergic transmission following CX3CL1 and adenosine application corresponds with results from studies of synaptic plasticity (see: Section \@ref(LTP)).

CX3CR1 signaling has been shown to influence microglial function under both normal and pathological conditions (Limatola and Ransohoff, 2014; Paolicelli et al., 2014).
For example, a transient reduction of microglial density during hippocampal development has been reported in Cx3cr1 knockout mice (Paolicelli et al., 2011). 
However, previous studies examining microglia ramification did not evidentiate morphological differences (Liang et al., 2009; Hoshiko et al., 2012), 

As described in the section on synaptic plasticity (see: \@ref(LTP)), several chemokines were documented to modulate LTP in the hippocampus, a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory [@bols_2018; @necula_2021; @rogers_2011; @zhou_2016]. <!-- pewnie jeszcze zmienić -->
Of these chemokines, CX3CL1 is the best characterized in this context.
Nevertheless, behavioral studies on the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in the regulation of learning and memory were giving contradictory results (see: Table 3).<!-- poprawna nazwa tabeli  // Of note, there is great controversy regarding the behavioral phenotype of *CX3CR1-/-* mice in the literature (Paolicelli et al., 2014).-->
Briefly, CX3CR^-/-^ mice have shown impaired [@rogers_2011], improved [@maggi_2011; @reshef_2017]  or unaltered [@serchov_2015] cognitive functions.  <!-- For instance, reports of impairment (Rogers et al., 2011), improvement (Maggi et al., 2011; Reshef et al., 2014) or no changes (Serchov et al., 2015) in hippocampal-dependent learning have been reported.  -->
It should be noted that findings from studies of synaptic plasticity correlate with behavioral output (see Table 1 and 2). <!-- tabeleeee -->
Those discrepancies may result from differences in housing conditions, animal gender, and age, or behavioral test protocols between laboratories. <!-- In each study involving behavioral studies with these animals, the relevance of housing conditions, animal gender and age, feeding and behavioral test protocols is brought to light (Gemma and Bachstetter, 2013). -->
However, this issue warrant further clarifications.

Moreover, dysfunctions in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CX3CR1 KO mice were further confirmed in CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices [@basilico_2019]. <!-- ale during development ? -->
Recordings from slices of transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability when compared to wild-type mice.
These results illustrate that neuron–microglia interactions profoundly influence the functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function. <!-- zmienić -->

Importantly, Sheridan et al. [@sheridan_2014] reported that the CX3CL1 application in the hippocampus has  opposing effects on glutamate-induced Ca^2+^ transients depending on whether it was applied alone or simultaneously with a GABA~A~ blocker, picrotoxin.
These results highlight the possible modulation of CX3CL1 in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition on the network level.
However, whether the chemokine system participates in feed-forward inhibition signaling remains an open question for future research.

As mentioned earlier in the section on synaptic transmission (see: \@ref(Glu)), in the CA1 hippocampus, CX3CL1 induced phosphorylation of AMPA subunit GluR1 at postsynaptic sites [@ragozzino_2006], which is one of the hallmarks of the LTD.
Moreover, one group reported  no difference in LTD in the hippocampus between adult wild-type and knockout mice.<!--cytowanie--> 
In contrast, LTD is enhanced in CX3CR1^-/-^ mice at P13 [@paolicelli_2011], suggesting that CX3CL1 has the highest relevance during early postnatal age.

However, similar electrophysiological studies indicated either a complete lack of LTP in knockout mice [@rogers_2011] or a more pronounced LTP than in wild-type counterparts when LTP was induced by a weak stimulation protocol [@maggi_2011]. 
Interestingly, when mice were housed in an enriched environment compared to wild-type mice, they had enhanced plasticity [@maggi_2009].
These results suggest that the absence of  microglia-driven CX3CR1 signaling impedes enrichment effects, possibly due to some shared  mechanisms that warrant further investigation. <!-- coś nie w porządku z tym zdaniem -->
It is speculative that this lack of beneficial response to environmental stimulation might be explained by altered microglia–neurons cross-talk, affecting the circuitry underlying synaptic plasticity.

Regarding the DG, CX3CL1 decreased the LTP at those synapses; however, when GABA~A~ receptors were blocked, the magnitude of the LTP was enhanced [@sheridan_2014], indicating that the CX3CL1-exerted actions may differ based on inhibitory/excitatory balance (see: Table 2). 
Alternatively, noting the CX3CL1-induced potentiation of NMDA function and thereby the increase in calcium transients [@scianni_2013] together with the inhibition of the LTP induction following NMDAR activation, it is also possible that CX3CL1-induced elevated level of intracellular calcium could interfere with the LTP induction [@scianni_2013]. 

These inconsistent findings between laboratories might result from differences in age, gender, diet, housing conditions, or electrophysiological protocols.
Especially age and gender could be relevant, as the same laboratories cannot replicate their results when those variables had differed. 
Hence, effects on synaptic plasticity and behavioral outcomes resulted from the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis may be transient and quickly compensated in knockout mice. 

Chemokine regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus. 
CX3CL1 was shown to induce synaptic depression of evoked parallel fibers inputs onto Purkinje neurons [@giovannelli_1998], and mice with CX3CR1^-/-^ receptor deletion were characterized by the LTP in the spinal cord [@bian_2015].
Future research should clarify whether mechanisms underlying CX3CL1-induced synaptic plasticity are general.  
However, it would be implausible, considering that (i) microglia displays many region-specific features, especially when compared in cerebellum and cortex [@stowell_2018], (ii) CX3CR1-induced microglial during development are region-specific [@lowery_2017], as well as (iii) mechanisms governing LTP may differ between structures, for instance, between the hippocampus and spinal cord [@liu_2017].

In particular, by measuring connections between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, mice with deletion of CX3CR1 revealed a decrease in  the  coherence  between  those two structures, compared  to  their wild-type  littermates (@zhan_2014, see Fig 4D).<!-- !-->
Thus, this finding suggests that the depletion of CX3CR1 leads to  a  decrease in  hippocampal–prefrontal connectivity, which may have behavioral consequences, such as anxiety or cognitive impairments [@zhan_2014].  
Moreover, knockout mice showed reduced frontal cortex oscillatory driving to the hippocampus than their wild-type littermates at baseline conditions  [@zhan_2015]. 
It is speculative whether it is the consequence of morphological modifications of microglia depleted of CX3CR1 [@piirainen_2021], but scanty evidence is available so far. <!-- tutaj może poprawić tę drugą część zdania...-->
Nevertheless, these results highlight a fundamental role of CX3CL1 at the network level. 
Hence, considering those findings and accumulating evidence of glial impact on the network, investigating chemokines’ role in neural networks may be an exciting direction in the future.

Indeed, there is mounting evidence which implicates both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Piccinin et al., 2010; Maggi et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011; Roseti et al.,2013; Scianni et al.,2013). <!-- zmienić // In fact, CX3CL1 is a confirmed inhibitor of basal glutamate synaptic activity in the hippocampus [@Bertollini2006]. -->

Regarding electrophysiological effects of CX3CL1 action, hippocampus is the most documented structure, as it has most-known network // a golden structure for electrophysiologist, with high basal levels of CX3CL1 transcript and protein expression. <!-- zmienić The high basal level of CX3CL1 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus is suggestive of a physiological, non-inflammatory function. -->
For example, CX3CL1 has been shown to reduce post-synaptic glutamate currents (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005), involving an increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit on serine 845 (Ragozzino et al., 2006). <!-- zmienić jeszcze trochę -- SPRAWDZIĆ spontaneous glutamate release and-->
The latter mechanism has been linked to ability of CX3CL1 to inhibit LTP and mimics long-term depression (LTD) at the CA3–CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2009).  <!-- zmienić CX3CL1-mediated regulation of glutamate transmission has been shown to be due to its post-synaptic effects on neurons and involves the dephosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit on serine 845, a mechanism reminiscent of LTD (Ragozzino et al., 2006). //Previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 inhibits LTP and mimics long-term depression (LTD) at the CA3–CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2009). -->
LTD can play vital roles in the context of memory-associated synaptic plasticity including synaptic scaling and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio mechanisms <!-- CITATION, ZMIENIĆ -->
These synaptic effects are consistent with a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons most likely exerted through the CX3CR1 receptor, which is reportedly expressed on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Meucci et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2005). <!-- zmienić -->
The ability of CX3CL1 to inhibit glutamate function is thought to be responsible for some of its neuroprotective actions, and provides further support for the chemokine-neuromodulatory role in the CNS [@adler_2005, @callewaere_2007, @guyon_2007]. <!-- not sure if it is my sentence Overall, previous studies indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, perhaps as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006; Turrigiano, 2008; Piccinin et al., 2010).-->
Consistent with this hypothesis, neuroprotective ADAM17-mediated increase in in soluble CX3CL1 is observed in multiple settings of glutamatergic neurotransmission where the chemokine is suggested to performa neuroprotective function (Chapman et al., 2000; Tsou et al., 2001; Erichsen et al., 2003; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2010; Pabon et al., 2011). <!-- zmienić-->

Beyond the hippocampus, CX3CL1 is also documented to reduce the activity of serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus through enhanced GABA~A~ receptor-mediated inhibition (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009).<!-- zmienić trochę drugą część -->


LTP-inducing TBS resulted in an up-regulation in CX3CL1 expression after 2 h on the stimulated DG blade compared to the upper unstimulated blade. - Sheridan2014

CX3CL1 has been reportedly up-regulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission where the chemokine is clearly protective against excitotoxic cell death (Tong et al., 2000; Tarozzo et al., 2002; Limatola et al., 2005; Cipriani et al., 2011; Briones et al., 2014). Moreover, both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, have been shown to be up-regulated in hippocampal neurons after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Yeo et al., 2011), a condition characterized by excessive glutamatergic excitation. Overall, the abundance and expression pattern of CX3CL1 make the chemokine ideally suited for sensing hippocampal glutamate tone. Our data supports a possible role for CX3CL1 in homeostatic mechanisms of synaptic scaling during memory-associated synaptic plasticity.-Sheridan2014



#### CX3CL1 and anxiety 
 
<!-- see also discussion -->
Besides its involvement in memory and learning, CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice have been gaining attention in relation to chronic stress. <!-- Regarding the regulation of emotional behavior, previous evidence shows that the connectivity of brain regions involved in the regulation of mood disorders is impaired in CX3CR1-/- animals (Squarzoni et al., 2014). -- WAŻNE CYTOWANIE SPRAWDZIĆ!!!! -->
Briefly, in comparison to wild-type littermates, CX3CR1 is important for  controlling social behavior and social dominance (@zhan_2014; @piirainen_2021, Table3). <!-- Here we report that 4-month- old female CX3CR1-/- mice show a hyperactive, anxiolytic-like and depressive-like phenotype, in agreement with previous data indicating altered social behavior in these mice (Zhan et al., 2014).-->
However, there are many inconsistencies. 
Regarding anxiety, most studies did not show any differences between genotypes [@rogers_2011, @hellwig_2016, @schubert_2018]. <!-- Although other authors detected no depressive-like phenotype of these mice in the sucrose preference (Milior et al., 2016) or in the TST (Hellwig et al., 2016), male and female animals were grouped and tested together. -->
Nonetheless, there is one study that suggests anxiolytic effects of CX3CR1 depletion [@bols_2018], whereas the other study indicates the opposite (@schubert_2018, Table3).<!--table-->
A similar situation  was described regarding depressive-like behavior: one study indicates knockout is more depressive measured by Forced Swim Test and/or Tail Suspension Test, whereas the other reported the opposite conclusion.
It seems like the main difference between those experiments was the gender between animals.
Specifically, CX3CR1^-/-^ females are more depressive and anxiolytic than wild-type littermates, whereas the depletion of the same receptor in males elicit the opposite reaction.  
However, as this hypothesis is based only on two studies, further investigation is needed.

<!-- SPRAWDZIĆ TEŻ TE CYTOWANIA
Interestingly, although stress resilience has been described in CX3CR1-/- mice (Rimmerman et al., 2017; Yirmiya et al., 2015), other authors found that these animals show greater depressive- like behavior in response to inflammation compared to WT counterparts (Corona et al., 2013). -->

###### Pharmacological blockade of microglia - minocycline

####### what it is 
Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, is well known for its antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive effects. 
minocycline has been recognized as playing two mainly independent roles: it is a microglial inhibitor as well as a second- generation tetracycline. 
Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, is well known for its functions, such as neuroprotection or antihypernociception, that have been identified in the last decade, and it typically acts by blocking microglial activation and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production (Yong et al., 2004). - Peng

Minocycline, a second-generation, broad spectrum, semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic is of particular interest as an analgesic, in addition to its anti-microbial effect. 

###### function

Minocycline effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier (Aronson, 1980) and has a proven safety record in humans (Thomas and Le, 2004).
Minocycline mediated inhibition of microglial activation has been reported to reduce nociception in inflammation-evoked pain (Hua et al., 2005), spinal cord contusion injury (Hains and Waxman, 2006) and spinal nerve ligation (Lin et al., 2007). 

Recent reports suggests that minocycline inhibits Na+ channels in the primary afferent neurons (Kim et al., 2011) and also inhibits phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) expression in the spinal cord (Cho et al., 2012), supporting a neuronal target for minocycline. 
Therefore, it is possible that the observed analgesic effect of minocycline in this study might not be exclusively through glial inhibition, but rather a combined effect on glial cells and neuronal targets. However, further experiments are warranted to identify these targets - Kannampalli2014

While the majority of these studies attribute the analgesic effect of minocycline to inhibition of microglial activation (Tikka et al., 2001; Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013), some studies have also reported on its action on other targets like astrocytes (Zhang et al., 2012) and neurons (González et al., 2007). 
While reports indicate that minocycline has no direct effect on the neurons, González et al. (2007) have reported that minocycline is associated with the mitigation of neuronal excitability, glutamate release, and Ca2+ overloading in hippocampal neurons. - Kannampalli2014

####### synaptic transmission 
Modulation of synaptic transmission is one of the analgesic mechanisms of minocycline. 
Although it has been reported that minocycline may suppress excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, it remains unclear whether it could affect inhibitory synaptic transmission, which also plays a key role in modulating pain signaling. - Peng2016

Minocycline affects dopamine (Hashimoto et al. 2007) and glutamate transmission and depresses Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal neurons (González et al. 2007). 
Furthermore, there is enough evidence that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells. 
Microglia secrete proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, proteases, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6) and excitatory amino acids, which can affect neural activity as well as neuronal circuit involved in drug addiction (Coull et al. 2005; Niwa et al. 2007b; Yirmiya & Goshen 2011). Minocycline can affect expression of these factors. 
It has been shown that minocycline is able to upregulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tumor necrosis factor-α (Chen et al. 2012b).
- Arezoomandan2018


Moreover, the effect of minocycline may differ on different types of neurons. 
For example, minocycline (50 nM) had no effect on basal excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 (Pascual et al., 2012) or SG neurons (Berta et al., 2014); however, 100 lM minocycline may inhibit dorsal root entry zone stimulation-elicited EPSCs in SG neurons (Cho et al., 2006) or may decrease sEPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons (Gonzalez et al., 2007). 
At a concentration of 200 lM, minocycline may decrease C-fiber evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission (Zhong et al., 2010). 
In addition, minocycline at 500 lM abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons (Itoh et al., 2011). 
The above observations suggest that minocycline may decrease neuronal excitability in a concentration- and cell-type-dependent manner by decreasing glutamatergic transmission. 
In addition to excitatory input, neurons also receive inhibitory synaptic transmission. 
If minocycline could modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission, then IPSC frequency or amplitude must be influenced by minocycline. 


#### CX3CR1 expression? Przejście

However, its constitutive expression in different CNS cells ( Ludwig et al., 2005; Rosito et al., 2012 ) suggests additional roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication. 

Synaptic transmission is explicitly related to dendritic spines, as these tiny, actin-rich, postsynaptic protrusions from a dendrite, receive most of the excitatory synaptic input in the brain. 
Functional and structural changes in dendritic spines are also critical for synaptic plasticity (see Section: \@ref(network)), a cellular model of learning and memory. 

Moreover, the spine morphology is highly dynamic: it could vary within the same dendritic arbor and thus is  interdependently regulated.

In agreement with glial contribution to synaptic functions,<!--może inaczej ująć--> astrocytes [@perezalvarez_2014], microglia [@paolicelli_2011], and oligodendrocytes [@zemmar_2018] are implicated in interactions with dendritic spines in a highly active-dependent manner.

The finding that chemokines exert a neuromodulatory role in the brain is essential for a better understanding of the complex communication network between neurons and cells from their surrounding microenvironment. 
This section illustrates the emergent concept of chemokine coordination of neural networks, such as neuroendocrine functions, GABA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, and synchronized oscillatory activity.

Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of chemokines regulation of  proper neural network functioning by their effects on interneurons migration and maturation.

Synaptic plasticity is defined as a molecular form of learning, memory, and development in neural circuits.
It mainly comprises such mechanisms as Hebbian plasticity, synaptic scaling, and adult neurogenesis. 
Among different factors regulating synaptic plasticity, glial cells have been considered key players in maintaining synapse homeostasis [@deluca_2020; @field_2020; @kettenmann_2011; @mederos_2018]. 

Hebbian synaptic plasticity is the earliest and most widely accepted neurobiological theory of memory consolidation. 
According to this concept, a synapse will be strengthened if the presynaptic neuron is active while the postsynaptic neuron is firing, a process called Hebbian modification. 

Considering the relevance of chemokines' role in neurodevelopment (i.e., neuronal/axonal migration and synaptic pruning), it can be hypothesized that proper chemokine signaling during neurodevelopment is of high importance to provide functional connectivity between many cortical regions. 
However, to date, there is a scarcity of data on this topic. 

<!--microglia and process - advanced microscopy
Microglial processes constantly survey the brain parenchyma,transiently contact neuronal elements, and can also engulf cellular debris and eliminate synapses. Using immunocytochemical EM against IBA-1, we found direct contacts between microglial process and neuronal perikarya, as well as presynaptic elements, postsynaptic elements, and synaptic clefts. Synaptic elements showing signs of autophagy were also frequently contacted by microglia in both CFA and EAE. Microglial inclusions, sometimes containing recognizable synaptic elements that probably resulted from phagocytosis, were occasionally encountered in both conditions. In addition, features associated with extracellular digestion or “exophagy” (Haka et al., 2016), such as microglial processes in association with extracellular space pockets that contained partially to completely disrupted cellular membranes, as well as synaptic elements, were observed. These features are suggestive of ongoing extracellular digestion, either mediated by microglial remodeling of the extracellular matrix or release of lysosomal proteins. The prevalence of extracellular digestion was significantly reduced in EAE. Accordingly, the expression of CD68 in IBA-1-labeled cells, a lysosome-associated protein often used as a marker of microglial “activation” or “phagocytosis” was significantly reduced in the BLA of EAE mice compared with CFA controls.// In contrast, a recent study with microglial gene profiling using microarray analysis revealed suppression of microglial genes during the early stages of EAE development; specifically, the genes related to their phagocytic functions and cytoskeleton organization were suppressed (Yamasaki et al., 2014). This suppression could have multiple effects, such as reduced phagocytosis, cytokine, chemokine, and metalloproteinase production (Shemer et al., 2015).//Reduced extracellular spaces between the neuron and microglia were also observed in the EAE amygdala. These spaces generally contained material undergoing digestion in the CFA controls (synaptic elements that could be identified or membranes in a more advanced state of digestion), suggesting a reduced pruning of synaptic materials in EAE (Haka et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2016).;;-->
