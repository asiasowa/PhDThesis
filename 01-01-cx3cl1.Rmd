### Chemokines actions in the CNS {#chemointheCNS}

Over the past two decades, mounting evidence has illustrated that chemokines are also essential players in the CNS during neurodevelopment and in the adult brain beyond their well-known immunological role.  
Accordingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors, including the described above CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes, overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS, suggesting their involvement in local communication, especially crosstalk between neurons and glia.

Recently, in the light of the "glial revolution", our long-held views of the functions of these cells have been completely challenged.
Astrocytes, previously considered supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, network oscillations, and behavior [@perea_2009; @mederos_2019]. 
Being organized into microdomains and coupled into multicellular astrocytic networks *via* gap junctions, they are highly specialized cells (for a review: @khakh_2015). 
Furthermore, astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites, and synapses.<!-- citations-->
For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte makes contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans [@oberheim_2009], suggesting bidirectional communication. 
Indeed, they are endowed with a great variety of ion channels and receptors [@olsen_2015; @seifert_2018; @kofuji_2021] to react to a changing microenvironment, while they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters [@araque_2014; @savtchouk_2018; @covelo_2018]. 
Ca^2+^ levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca^2+^ levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission. 
Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews [@araque_2014; @guerragomes_2017; @bazargani_2016].

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about 5–12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord [@szepesi_2018].
They are derived from the myeloid precursor cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development (for a review, see: @prinz_2011).
These glial cells are also broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a review, see: @szepesi_2018).
Although microglia have long been recognized as "guardians of the brain", regulating inflammatory responses in the CNS, it is becoming increasingly evident that their functions are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain during both development and adulthood.
Being equipped by highly motile processes, microglia are dynamic and plastic cells that constantly monitor the microenvironment to sense local perturbation. 
Moreover, similar to astrocytes, microglia also express numerous cell surface ion channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, as well as signaling molecules.

Hence, both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamic and heterogeneous cells.
Notably, those rich repertoires of expressed surface and signaling molecules include a set of chemokines and their receptors. <!-- Moreover, their ability to form direct contact and release the soluble factors, such as chemokines, enables bidirectional interaction with other cell types in the CNS. -->
Thus, glial cells can both react to and release chemokines (for example: @dorf_2000, @mckimmie_2010; @sowa_2017).<!-- cytowania dotyczące microglia-->
Given constant glial monitoring of brain parenchyma, these immune molecules might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the influence of the environment to brain function, from cellular to synaptic, network, and finally behavioral levels.
<!--Therefore, dissecting mechanisms of neuron-glial communications in the brain is of high importance, as identifying molecular targets may be used to counteract brain damage and preserve brain homeostasis.-->
<!--Consistent with this notion, accumulating data indicate chemokine-mediated coordination of glial cells and chemokine system.
What is more, in the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, the CX3CR1 receptor gene has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter [@jung_2000].
Considering CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression, this genetic strain is one of the essential tools for studying the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation [@paolicelli_2014].
Thus, this model resulted in an extensive body of evidence, highlighting the key role of CX3CL1 signaling in regulating a broad spectrum of aspects of microglia functions, as discussed below. --><!--EWENTUALNIE TO POTEM SKRÓCIĆ-->

The first discoveries regarding CX3CL1 and CXCL12 non-inflammatory roles were studies showing their influence on the reduction of neurotoxicity, mainly by activating neuroprotective pathways, such as Akt phosphorylation or activation of MAP kinases  (p-38, ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")`)<!--poprawić--> [@maciejewskilenoir_1999; @meucci_2000]. <!--Another aspect regulated by CXCL12 is its implication in neuroprotective actions, mainly by activating neuroprotective pathways., such as Akt and ERK`r knitr::asis_output("\U00BD")` [@vauzour_2007].inne, poprawić....--><!-- for example the activation of the Ca^2+^ and cAMP-dependent transcription factor CREB [@meucci_1998] It can also act post-synaptically by activating aG protein activated inward rectifier K+(GIRK), a voltage-gated K channel Kv2.1 associated to neuronal survival, and by increasing high voltage-activated Ca2+currents.

Specifically, CXCL12 [@meucci_1998] and then CX3CL1 [@meucci_2000] were reported to reduce the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons induced by gp120 or glia deprivation<!--, further indicating their direct neuronal actions-->.
Later, more studies further documented that both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cultures from either rodents or humans [@deiva_2004; @limatola_2005; @nicolai_2010].

Moreover, the binding of CX3CL1 to microglial CX3CR1 was shown to restrain LPS-induced microglia activation (@mizuno_2003; @zujovic_2000, for a review: @biber_2007), leading to the initial presumption that CX3CL1 maintains microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state.
However, further studies illustrated that microglia activation is not an all or none event, but rather a continuum of progressive stages depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cues in the local environment, which, in turn, change their phenotype and functional activity (@crain_2013; @lively_2013; for a review: @masuda_2020 and @tan_2020). <!-- Accordingly, CX3CR1 signaling has been reported to impact microglial function under both physiological and pathological conditions, which is discussed throughout this dissertation.może też że nei tylko neuroprotective? -->

Nevertheless, following the CX3CL1 application, microglia was reported to release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection, including adenosine [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010]. 
It is an endogenous modulator of brain functions, binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes  (adenosine A1 receptor, adenosine A2A receptor,  adenosine A~2C~ receptor, and adenosine A~3~ receptor - A~1~R, A~2A~R, A~2C~, and A~3~R, respectively). 
It was shown that adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection *via* A~1~R [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010].
This receptor, expressed on microglia, was also reported to be required for CX3CL1 increase in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) activity in astrocytes, resulting in higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and thereby neuroprotective action [@catalano_2013].
Thus, these data nicely illustrate the CX3CL1-regulated local communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to neuroprotection.<!-- A neuroprotective aspect of CX3CL1 was also studied in the context of neurodegeneration. Specifically, it was shown that deletion of CX3CR1 in microglia led to increased release of IL-1 and neuronal death in such models as systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [@cardona_2006].Notably, gene insertion of the only soluble variant of CX3CL1, not the membrane-anchored version, was shown to rescue motor coordination and reduce neurodegeneration in the PD model [@morganti_2012].Similarly, only upregulation of soluble CX3CL1 was reported to reduce Tau-pathology [@finneran_2019]. On the other hand, in the ischemic model, the CX3CL1 intracerebroventricular injection was shown to induce neuroprotective effects (e.g., a reduction of a lesion volume and neurological deficits) [@cipriani_2011].Again, the involvement of A~1~Rs was associated with those effects. --> 

The next milestone in neuroimmunology was observations that CX3CL1 and CXCL12 with their corresponding receptors exhibit the highest expression during neurodevelopment, indicating their crucial functions during this period. 
Indeed, it has become increasingly evident that both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes are crucial players in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival in this period. <!-- citations?--> 
For instance, during hippocampal development, CX3CR1^-/-^ deficient microglia showed impaired migration  [@pagani_2015; @paolicelli_2011].
This observation was associated with their delayed synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient reduction of synaptic density and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties [@paolicelli_2011].
Precisely, these changes were observed during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline.<!--, highlighting CX3CR1 impact on synaptic pruning during neurodevelopment.-->
Importantly, these mice were also tested in similar experimental settings in their adulthood (P40) [@zhan_2014]. 
Although dendritic spine density remained unchanged, neurons from CX3CR1^-/-^ mice still displayed a lower frequency of mEPSCs and sEPSCs than their wild-type littermates, illustrating that a transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic transmission despite unchanged the number of excitatory synapses [@zhan_2014]. <!--These data support the idea of a critical window during which microglia-mediated synaptic pruning is crucial for proper circuit maturation. -->

On the other hand, those neurodevelopmental processes regulated by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 (i.e., proliferation, migration, and survival) are also present in the adult brain. 
Accordingly, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are associated not only with developmental neurogenesis [@lysko_2011; @pujol_2005; @tran_2004], but also adult neurogenesis, which is restricted to two neurogenic regions, i.e., the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) near the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.<!-- Accordingly, CXC12 is found to be a key player in neurogenesis during the development of, among others, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus .// CXCL12 was also reported to guide neural progenitors [@bhattacharyya_2008; @casoni_2012; @tran_2003].-->
For example, both CXCR4 and CX3CR1 receptors are expressed on neural stem cells [@ji_2004].
In addition, it is well established that CXCL12 is responsible for the generation and positioning of new neurons within these niches, as well as their axonal and dendritic outgrowth and branching [@abe_2015; @abe_2018; @zhu_2017].
Moreover, similar to what was observed during the neurodevelopment, in CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice, adult-born granule neurons in the DG also displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with additionally observed morphological changes, such as enlargement and shortening [@bols_2018]. 
Besides being ultrastructurally enlarged, synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality. <!-- lepiej, ale upewnić się -->

Given their previously mentioned inhibition of both glutamate and NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity, together with their influence on neuronal processes outgrowth, branching, and synaptic pruning, one could speculate that CXCL12 and CX3CL1 could modulate electrophysiological properties in the CNS. 
Indeed, accumulating data reveals that these chemokines modulate neuronal electrical activity through both postsynaptic (e.g., changes in Ca^2+^ transients or intrinsic membrane properties by activation/inactivation of particular channels/receptors following CKRs activation) and presynaptic (i.e., including presence in synaptic vesicle and (co-)release of neuropeptides/neurotransmitters/gliotransmitters) mechanisms (for a review: @rostne_2007 and @sowa_2021).
For example, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents [@lauro_2008; @limatola_2005; @meucci_1998; @ragozzino_2006]. 
<!--These effects are probably a result of PKA-related phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845 [@ragozzino_2006].-->
Importantly, further investigations revealed that CX3CL1 might not exclusively act on postsynaptic neurons but also activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine [@piccinin_2010]. 
Similarly, one of the adenosinergic receptors, the A~2A~R, together with D-serine release from glial cells, is also required for CX3CL1 regulation of NMDA receptor function [@scianni_2013].

Moreover, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 impact adult neurogenesis along with synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, which are believed to affect synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. <!-- Accordingly, disruption of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling has harmful effects on both neurogenesis and cognition.-->
Accordingly,  both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 axes were reported to be upregulated following learning [@rogers_2011; @su_2012].<!-- dodać cytowanie z ... Consistently, after learning, the CXCR4 level was documented to be increased in CA3 .// Importantly, as adult neurogenesis is known to be an important player in memory, CXCL12 was also shown to be upregulated after learning [@su_2012]. -->
In addition, several lines of evidence illustrated that CX3CL1 modulates synaptic plasticity in this region [@bertollini_2006; @maggi_2009; @maggi_2011; @paolicelli_2011; @ragozzino_2006; @rogers_2011] and regulates learning and memory [@maggi_2011; @reshef_2017; @rogers_2011; @serchov_2015].
<!--In relation to glia, increasing studies implicated both exogenous or exercise-induced CX3CL1 in promoting neurogenesis and NSC/NPC activity in a microglia-dependent manner, whereas depletion of CX3CR1 resulted in a decreased number of newly generated neurons [@vukovic_2012; @bachstetter_2011; @rogers_2011].
In addition to microglial mediation, CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice were shown to significantly reduce neurogenesis, which could be reversed by IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` receptor antagonist administration [@bachstetter_2011].
When behaviorally assessed, these mice displayed impaired motor learning, spatial recognition, and fear-conditioning. 
Interestingly, blocking IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` signaling reversed hippocampal-dependent learning, whereas motor learning was still impaired [@rogers_2011]. -->

Chemokines' regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus. 
Briefly, both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 molecules were shown to affect synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum [@giovannelli_1998; @ragozzino_2002], and mice with CX3CR1^-/-^ receptor deletion were characterized by the LTP in the spinal cord [@bian_2015].
These findings may be associated with CX3CL1-mediated behavioral consequences regarding motor coordination and pain [@rogers_2011; @verge_2004].
It also should be noted that another form of synaptic plasticity, i.e., synaptic scaling, is widely accepted to be mediated by TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` [@bezzi_2001], which is mainly expressed by astrocytes, for example, *via* CXCR4 activation [@stellwagen_2006]. 
Therefore, by modulating TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity [@stellwagen_2006].

In addition, mounting evidence shows interactions between the chemokine system and "classical" neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. <!-- citation and example -->
For instance, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the substantia nigra (SN), the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN [@guyon_2005; @guyon_2006; @heinisch_2010; @ragozzino_1998].
<!--CXCR4 is also widely expressed on microglia, and thus being able to react to astrocytic glutamate. najlepiej rozbudować -->
By acting on the presynaptic site, CXCL12 affects the activity of serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons, thereby modulating the release of neuroactive molecules [@guyon_2005; @guyon_2006; @heinisch_2010]. 
Moreover, CXCL12 is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: @bhattacharyya_2008).
However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin, MCH, and DA<!-- dodać inne + cytowania-->), <!--together with ...., --> postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved in this phenomenon. 
For example, in MCH neurons, CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na^+^ and K^+^ channels of the action potential [@guyon_2005], or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents [@guyon_2005a].
These results suggest that CXCL12 signaling may be involved in neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and stress.
In line with this notion, CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia.
Not only a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the PVN and perifornical lateral hypothalamus, but also an intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus [@poon_2016]. 
These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior. <!-- Both SDF-1 and GABA have been shown to regulate the rate of GnRH neuronal migration by accelerating and slowing migration, respectively. As such, this system was used to explore the mechanism by which these molecules act to produce coordinated cell movement during development. In the present study, GABA and SDF-1 are shown to exert opposite effects on the speed of cell movement by activating depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signaling pathways, GABA via changes in chloride and SDF-1 via changes in potassium. GABA and SDF-1 were also found to act synergistically to promote linear rather than random movement. The simultaneous activation of these signaling pathways, therefore, results in tight control of cellular speed and improved directionality along the migratory pathway of GnRH neurons. --><!-- Precisely, CXCR4 was reported to be tonically active at low physiological concentrations, constantly exerting its action on MCH neurons.
Consistently, under basal conditions, those cells showed more hyperpolarized membrane potential than orexin neurons, which do not express CXCR4 [@eggermann_2003]. -->

Similarly, the dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of both pre- and postsynaptic actions of CXCL12. 
CXCL12 was reported to enhance the frequency of sIPSCs and mIPSCs in this region, indicating presynaptic mechanisms, which is in line with the documented presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons [@guyon_2006].
In addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 could act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of HVA currents [@guyon_2008a].
Consistent with this data, by using unilateral intranigral or intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12, a further study has illustrated that this chemokine triggered contralateral turns in circling behavior  [@skrzydelski_2007]. 
Of note, considering that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in dopamine neurons<!-- citations -->, it is tempting to speculate that this chemokine may act in an autocrine manner [@guyon_2008a].
Importantly, some CXCL12-induced increase in an inward current is suggested to be induced from glutamate release from astrocytes [@guyon_2006].
