### Chemokines functions in the CNS under physiological conditions 

Over the past two decades, mounting evidence have been illustrating that beyond their well-known immunological role, chemokines are also important players in the CNS during neurodevelopment and in the adult brain. <!-- -->
Accordingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS, suggesting their involvement in local communication, including the described above CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes.
Consistently, chemokines and their receptors are emerging as a key mediators of homeostatic crosstalk between neurons and glia. 
Recently, in the light of the "glial revolution", our long-held views of the functions of these cells were completely challenged.
Both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamics and heterogeneous cells, expressing a rich repertoire of ion channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, including CKRs.
Considering that glial cells constantly monitor brain parenchyma, these molecules might enable glial cells to sense not only local perturbation but also neuronal activity, integrating it within glial networks. 
Thus, it can be speculated that chemokines might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the influence of the environment to brain function and behavior.
Therefore, dissecting mechanisms of neuron-glial communications in the brain is of high importance, as identifying molecular targets may be used to counteract brain damage and preserve brain homeostasis.
What is especially important and extensively studied is that 

In the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, the CX3CR1 receptor gene has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter [@jung_2000].
Considering CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression, this genetic strain is one of the essential tools for studying the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation [@paolicelli_2014].
Thus, this model resulted in an extensive body of evidence, highlighting the key role of CX3CL1 signaling in regulating a broad spectrum of aspects of microglia functions, as discussed below. 

#### Microglia {#microglia}

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about 5–12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord [@szepesi_2018].
They are derived from the myeloid precursor cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development (for a review, see: @prinz_2011).
Finally, these glial cells are broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a review, see: @szepesi_2018).
Although microglia have long been recognized as "guardians of the brain", regulating inflammatory responses in the CNS, it is becoming increasingly evident that their functions are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain during both development and adulthood.
Being equipped by numerous cell surface receptors and channels, with<!-- or exhibiting--> highly motile processes, microglia are dynamic and plastic cells that constantly monitor the microenvironment to sense local perturbation. 
Moreover, their ability to form direct contact and release the soluble factors, such as chemokines, enables bidirectional interaction with other cell types in the CNS. 

#### Astrocytes

Astrocytes, previously considered supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, network oscillations, and behavior [@perea_2009; @mederos_2019]. 
Being organized into microdomains and coupled into multicellular astrocytic networks *via* gap junctions, they are highly specialized cells (for a review: @khakh_2015). 
Furthermore, astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites, and synapses.<!-- citations-->
For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte makes contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans [@oberheim_2009], suggesting bidirectional communication. 
Indeed, they are endowed with a great variety of ion channels and receptors [@olsen_2015; @seifert_2018; @kofuji_2021] to react to a changing microenvironment, while they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters [@araque_2014; @savtchouk_2018; @covelo_2018]. 
Ca^2+^ levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca^2+^ levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission. 
Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews [@araque_2014; @guerragomes_2017; @bazargani_2016].
Thus, astrocytes can both react to and release the set of chemokines (for example: @dorf_2000, @mckimmie_2010; @sowa_2017).<!--more citations--> 

#### Neurodevelopment 

For instance, it is increasingly evident that CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is a crucial player during neurodevelopment.
Accordingly, the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis was demonstrated to affect the outgrowth of dopaminergic axons in the forebrain and the laminar positioning of subsets of cortical interneurons [@squarzoni_2014].
Similarly, CX3CR1^-/-^ deficient microglia during hippocampal development showed impaired migration [@pagani_2015; @paolicelli_2011].
This observation was associated with their delayed synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient reduction of synaptic density and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties [@paolicelli_2011].
Precisely, these changes were observed during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline. <!--, highlighting CX3CR1 impact on synaptic pruning during neurodevelopment.-->

Interestingly, these mice were also tested in similar experimental settings in their adulthood (P40) [@zhan_2014]. 
Although dendritic spine density remained unchanged, neurons from CX3CR1^-/-^ mice still displayed a lower frequency of mEPSCs and sEPSCs than their wild-type littermates. 
These results illustrate that a transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic multiplicity, whereas the number of excitatory synapses remained the same [@zhan_2014].
These data support the idea of a critical window during which microglia-mediated synaptic pruning is crucial for proper circuit maturation.

#### CX3CL1 action in the CNS {#CX3CL1inthebrain}

Initially, the binding of CX3CL1 to its receptor CX3CR1 was believed to maintain microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state by showing that this chemokine can restrain LPS-induced microglia activation (@mizuno_2003; @zujovic_2000, for a review: @biber_2007). 
However, further studies illustrated that microglia activation is not an all or none event, but rather a continuum of progressive stages depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cues in the local environment, which, in turn, change their phenotype and functional activity (@crain_2013; @lively_2013; for a review: @masuda_2020 and @tan_2020). 
Accordingly, CX3CR1 signaling has been reported to impact microglial function under both physiological and pathological conditions. 



Moreover, it is well-established that not only microglia control the elimination and maturation of synapses, but also these cells prune synapses at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sides, thereby regulating synaptic innervation [@paolicelli_2011; @schafer_2012]. 
In line with these findings, by using the same strain of mice, another study indicated that in the dentate gyrus (DG), adult-born granule neurons also displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with additionally observed morphological changes, such as enlargement and shortening [@bols_2018]. 
Besides being ultrastructurally enlarged, synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality. <!-- lepiej, ale upewnić się -->

#### Synaptic transmission 

Furthermore, dysfunctions in glutamatergic neurotransmission were further confirmed in CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices [@basilico_2019]. 
Recordings from slices of transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability compared to wild-type mice, illustrating that neuron–microglia crosstalk profoundly impacts functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function.

These results are nicely complemented by findings obtained by studies using mixed neuronal and glial cultures [@ji_2013].
Specifically, adding microglial cells to the hippocampal neuronal culture results in an upregulation of excitatory synaptic currents, together with a higher density of dendritic spines in neurons.
In contrast, microglial depletion from hippocampal organotypic cultures led to both reduction in the dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission. 
Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in adult mice was associated with preventing dendritic spine loss in obese mice [@cope_2018].
These findings strongly support the notion that microglia are key regulators of the dendritic spine density in both the developing and the adult brain. 
Another CX3CL1-mediated function in the CNS is neuroprotection.
First, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce neuronal cell death following gp120-, glutamate-induced and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cultures from either rodents or humans [@deiva_2004; @limatola_2005; @meucci_2000]. 
On the other hand, following the CX3CL1 application, microglia was reported to release soluble factors promoting neuroprotection, such as adenosine [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010]. <!-- zmienić microglial cells treated with CX3CL1 release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection in mixed hippocampal neuron–glia cultures.-->
It is an endogenous modulator of brain functions, with increasingly evident actions on synaptic transmission [@ribeiro_2010] or glia [@boison_2010], which acts by binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes (adenosine A1 receptor, adenosine A2A receptor, adenosine A~2C~ receptor, and adenosine A~3~ receptor - A~1~R, A~2A~R, A~2C~, and A~3~R, respectively).
Adenosine was shown to modulate CX3CL1 neuroprotection *via* A~1~R [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010].
This receptor, expressed on microglia, was also reported to be required for CX3CL1 increase in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) activity in astrocytes, resulting in higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and thereby neuroprotective action [@catalano_2013].
This data nicely illustrate the CX3CL1-regulated local communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. 

A neuroprotective aspect of CX3CL1 was also studied in the context of neurodegeneration. <!-- Disruption of FKN signaling has also been studied in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. -->
Specifically, it was shown that deletion of CX3CR1 in microglia led to increased release of IL-1<!--beta--> and neuronal death in such models as systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [@cardona_2006].
Notably, gene insertion of the only soluble variant of CX3CL1, not the membrane-anchored version, was shown to rescue motor coordination and reduce neurodegeneration in the PD model [@morganti_2012].
Similarly, only upregulation of soluble CX3CL1 was reported to reduce Tau-pathology [@finneran_2019]. 
On the other hand, in the ischemic model, the CX3CL1 intracerebroventricular injection was shown to induce neuroprotective effects (e.g., a reduction of a lesion volume and neurological deficits) [@cipriani_2011].
Again, the involvement of A~1~Rs was associated with those effects.

Considering the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of dendritic spines, along with its inhibition of both glutamate and NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity, one could speculate that CX3CL1 might modulate excitatory synaptic transmission.
Indeed, there are several lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis.
For example, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents [@lauro_2008; @limatola_2005; @meucci_1998; @ragozzino_2006]. 
These effects are probably a result of PKA-related phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845 [@ragozzino_2006].
Further investigations revealed that CX3CL1 might not exclusively act on postsynaptic neurons but also activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine. 
Of note, sole adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure [@piccinin_2010]. 
Similar to studies concerning the neuroprotective action of CX3CL1 described above, this CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R and, to the lesser extent, A~1~R [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]. 
Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. 
Moreover, the A~2A~ receptor, together with D-serine release from glial cells, is also required for CX3CL1 regulation of NMDA receptor function [@scianni_2013].
Overall, several lines of evidence described above indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, possibly as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms, required for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010]. 

Indeed, previously described reduction of postsynaptic glutamate currents *via* dephosphorylation of GluR1 AMPA in acute brain slices is associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) and mimics long-term depression (LTD) [@bertollini_2006; @ragozzino_2006]. 
Accordingly, LTD is enhanced in CX3CR1^-/-^ mice at P13 [@paolicelli_2011], suggesting that CX3CL1 has the highest relevance during early postnatal age.
However, similar electrophysiological studies indicated either a complete lack of LTP in knockout mice [@rogers_2011] or a more pronounced LTP than in wild-type counterparts when LTP was induced by a weak stimulation protocol [@maggi_2011]. 
Interestingly, when mice were housed in an enriched environment compared to wild-type mice, they had enhanced plasticity [@maggi_2009].
These results suggest that the absence of microglia-driven CX3CR1 signaling impedes enrichment effects, possibly due to some shared mechanisms that warrant further investigation. 
However, at the network level, microglial interactions with synapses were shown to be important in regulating the maturation of neural circuits and shaping their connectivity in an activity- and experience-dependent manner, altering synaptic plasticity [@paolicelli_2011; @parkhurst_2013; @schafer_2012; @tremblay_2010; @wake_2009].


#### Synaptic plasticity

As synaptic plasticity is widely known as a molecular model of learning, the changes in synaptic plasticity correlates should results in modulation in learning and memory. 
In line with this hypothesis, behavioral studies on the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in the regulation of learning and memory were giving contradictory results, reflecting changes in synaptic plasticity in the studies described above.
Briefly, CX3CR^-/-^ mice have shown impaired [@rogers_2011], improved [@maggi_2011; @reshef_2017], or unaltered [@serchov_2015] cognitive functions. 
Those discrepancies may result from differences in housing conditions, animal gender, age, or behavioral test protocols between laboratories.
However, this issue warrants further clarifications. 

Moreover, adult neurogenesis, especially in the DG, is also believed to affect memory and learning, and CX3CL1 is suggested to be implicated in those processes. <!-- lepiej to napisać --> 
Accordingly, disruption of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling has harmful effects on both neurogenesis and cognition. 
Increasing studies implicated both exogenous or exercise-induced CX3CL1 in promoting neurogenesis and NSC/NPC activity in a microglia-dependent manner, whereas depletion of CX3CR1 resulted in a decreased number of newly generated neurons [@vukovic_2012; @bachstetter_2011; @rogers_2011].
In addition to microglial mediation, CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice were shown to significantly reduce neurogenesis, which could be reversed by IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` receptor antagonist administration [@bachstetter_2011].
When behaviorally assessed, these mice displayed impaired motor learning, spatial recognition, and fear-conditioning. 
Interestingly, blocking IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` signaling reversed hippocampal-dependent learning, whereas motor learning was still impaired [@rogers_2011]. 

Another aspect in relation to CX3CL1 involvement in synaptic plasticity concerns the activity of interneurons.
Importantly, CX3CL1 was shown to decrease the LTP at synapses in the DG; however, when GABA~A~ receptors were blocked, the magnitude of the LTP was enhanced [@sheridan_2014].
These results might highlight the possible modulation of CX3CL1 in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition on the network level. 
In line with this hypothesis, CX3CL1 is also able to modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission. 
For example, beyond the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was documented to increase the amplitude of sIPSCs and eIPSC without affecting PPR, increasing the sensitivity of serotoninergic neurons to GABA inputs and consequently inhibiting 5-HT neurotransmission [@heinisch_2009; @heinisch_2011]. 
In addition, by using human tissue from epileptic patients, which is usually less responsive to the repeated activation of GABA~A~ receptors than those from healthy tissue [@ragozzino_2005], it was shown that CX3CL1 reduced this desensitization of GABA~A~ currents in cortical pyramidal neurons [@roseti_2013].

Of note, not only CX3CL1 modulates local communication and networks within a structure, but also some initial evidence implicates this chemokine in coupling between brain regions. 
Neuronal populations are thought to couple between structures, reflecting information processing, which can be quantified using coherence as a measure (for a review: @schnitzler_2005). 
In particular, by measuring connections between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, mice with deletion of CX3CR1 revealed a decrease in the coherence between those two structures, compared to their wild-type littermates [@zhan_2014].<!-- , see Fig 4D-->
Thus, this finding suggests that the CX3CR1 knockdown leads to a decrease in hippocampal–prefrontal connectivity, which may have behavioral consequences, such as anxiety or cognitive impairments [@zhan_2014].
Moreover, knockout mice showed reduced frontal cortex oscillatory driving to the hippocampus than their wild-type littermates at baseline conditions [@zhan_2015]. 
It is speculative whether it is the consequence of morphological modifications of microglia depleted of CX3CR1 [@piirainen_2021], but scanty evidence is available so far. <!-- tutaj może poprawić tę drugą część zdania...-->

CX3CL1 regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus. 
Briefly, this signaling molecule was shown to induce synaptic depression of evoked parallel fibers inputs onto Purkinje neurons [@giovannelli_1998], and mice with CX3CR1^-/-^ receptor deletion were characterized by the LTP in the spinal cord [@bian_2015].
These findings may be associated with CX3CL1-mediated behavioral consequences regarding motor coordination and pain [@rogers_2011; @verge_2004].

#### Behavior

Besides mentioned above behavioral phenotypes, CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice have been gaining attention in relation to chronic stress. 
Briefly, in comparison to wild-type littermates, CX3CR1 is essential for controlling social behavior and social dominance [@zhan_2014; @piirainen_2021]. 
However, there are many inconsistencies. 
Regarding anxiety, most studies did not show any differences between genotypes [@rogers_2011; @hellwig_2016; @schubert_2018]. 
Nonetheless, there is one study that suggests anxiolytic effects of CX3CR1 depletion [@bols_2018], whereas the other study indicates the opposite [@schubert_2018].
A similar situation was described regarding depressive-like behavior: one study indicates knockout is more depressive measured by Forced Swim Test and/or Tail Suspension Test, whereas the other reported the opposite conclusion.
It seems like the main difference between those experiments was the gender between animals.
Specifically, CX3CR1^-/-^ females are more depressive and anxiolytic than wild-type littermates, whereas the depletion of the same receptor in males elicits the opposite reaction. 
However, as this hypothesis is based only on two studies, further investigation is needed.
