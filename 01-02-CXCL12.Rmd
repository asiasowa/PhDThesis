### CXCL12

CXCL12/SDF-1α belongs to the CXC group of chemokines. CXCL12/SDF-1α is the predominant and the smallest isoform (from all of six isoforms that are alternative spicing products of one common mRNA precursor molecule). It is also the smallest, at 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. 

SDF-1α (CXCL12) is another chemokine which has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive distribution in the CNS as well as the fact that it can be produced not only by glial cells but also by neurons [@Banisadr2003, @Heinisch2010a, @Stumm2002]. This chemokine has been shown to play an essential role in brain plasticity during development but also in regulating the activity of various brain circuits in normal and pathological conditions [@Merino2014, @Timotijević2012, @Tiveron2008a]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that there are several cross-talks between the CXCL12 and with its receptor CXCR4 and other neurotransmitter systems in the brain (e.g. GABA, glutamate and endocannabinoids) [@Heinisch2010a, @Heinisch2011]. The neuromodulatory actions of CXCL12 have been observed in various neuronal populations, including the hippocampus [@Kasiyanov2008], cerebellum [@Limatola2000], MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area [@Guyon2005] (LHA), vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamus [@Callewaere2006], dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra [@Guyon2006], the dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2010a] and recently the amygdala [@Yang2016]. What is particularly interesting, CXCL12 has often similar effects in these various circuits (increase in glutamate and/or GABA synaptic activity), however these effects occur via different mechanisms, even within one structure. For example, in the dorsal raphe nucleus CXCL12 increases the frequency of recorded spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSC) in serotonergic neurons through a pre-synaptic mechanism, but decreases sIPSC amplitude via a post-synaptic mechanism in non-serotonergic neurons [@Heinisch2010a]. Moreover, CXCL12 often appears to exert opposite effects on neuronal function depending on its concentration, e.g. in MCH-expressing neurons of the LHA, where the action potential discharge is different depending on the concentration [@Guyon2005]. Of particular interest is the observation that pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation leads to elevated levels of CXCL12 and other chemokines by activation of glial or endothelial cells which in turn release chemokines [@Guyon2014]. The chemokines released bind to CXCR4 present on neurons and induce changes in excitability that could induce an adaptive response to inflammation, leading to “sickness behavior,” characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue [@Dantzer2001, @Dantzer2007]. Sickness behavior is considered to be the physiological and psychological effect of immune activation during the course of infection, which is primarily mediated by the central action of peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines. Given the abundance of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS, it is not surprising that changes of cytokine/chemokine levels during inflammation are causing multiple physiological and behavioral perturbations. For example, effects of CXCL12 on dorsal raphe neurons could underlie depressive symptoms frequently observed with inflammation [@Maes1998], as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression. Similarly, the effects of CXCL12 on MCH neurons which are part of the feeding behavior and metabolism control circuit [@Nahon2006] could explain anorexia. These symptoms of sickness behavior are usually reversible when inflammation stops. Overall, this chemokine system is one of the key players in the neuro-immune interface that participates in shaping CNS responses to changes in the environment.

<!-- Unlike many chemokines whose expression is strongly up-regulated during inflammatory responses, the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 are constitutively and widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (Banisadr et al. 2002; Sanchez-Alcaniz et al. 2011; Schonemeier et al. 2008; Stumm et al. 2002; Stumm et al. 2003). -->

• CXCR7 is an interesting atypical chemokine receptor (Maksym et al., 2009). Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, CXCR7 is conserved well across the vertebrate species including sea lamprey (Nomiyama et al., 2011). It binds CXCL11 and CXCL12. Importantly, CXCR7 can heterodimerize with CXCR4 and modulate the effect of CXCL12 on CXCR4. Furthermore, CXCR7 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways (Maksym et al., 2009). During embryogenesis, CXCR7 is necessary for proper migration of primordial germ cells to CXCL12 via CXCR4 by acting as a sink for CXCL12 (Boldajipour et al., 2008). CXCR7 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007). Although poorly expressed in normal adult tissues, CXCR7 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors and tumor-associated vessels and appears to promote tumor growth and neoangiogenesis partly by signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Maksym et al., 2009).
• Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are known to reside in the bone marrow. Broxmeyer et al. (2005) reported that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced release of HSCs from the bone marrow, indicating that the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a key signal maintaining HSCs in the bone marrow. This observation had potential clinical utility, because certain cancer patients are candidates for whole-body irradiation followed by reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment via HSCs. Thus, the ability of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to release HSCs from the bone marrow meant that these ‘‘mobilized’’ HSCs could be isolated from the blood of the patient in sufficient numbers to permit repopulation with autologous HSCs (Uy et al., 2008). Interestingly, AMD3100 synergizes with granulocyte colony stimulating factor to mobilize HSCs, improving the effectiveness of the approach and allowing the isolation of enough cells for autologous cell transplantation. This combined approach has been used in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and with multiple myeloma (Pusic and DiPersio, 2010). Other CXCR4- based therapeutics have been reviewed recently (Peled et al., 2012).
• These developments underscore the important roles that CXCR4 plays in development. Other studies have documented that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays pivotal roles in homing of various stem cells to particular places of the embryo during development. One of the most useful experimental models to understand these mechanisms has been the zebrafish, where CXCR4 is the signal that guides stem cells that give rise to the gonads of the developing fish embryo (Doitsidou et al., 2002; Knaut et al., 2003). More recent studies have documented the coordinated roles of CXCR4, CXCL12, and CXCR7 in the development of the central nervous system in the zebrafish (Diotel et al., 2010; Tiveron and Cremer, 2008). Thus, certain homeo- static chemokine receptors play key roles in the homing of various stem cells. The ability of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in directing stem cell homing is probably related to its prominent role in directing the metastatic destination of tumor cells as well (Zlotnik et al., 2011)
