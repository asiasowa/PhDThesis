### CXCL12

CXCL12/SDF-1α belongs to the CXC group of chemokines. CXCL12/SDF-1α is the predominant and the smallest isoform (from all of six isoforms that are alternative spicing products of one common mRNA precursor molecule). It is also the smallest, at 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. 

SDF-1α (CXCL12) is another chemokine which has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive distribution in the CNS as well as the fact that it can be produced not only by glial cells but also by neurons [@banisadr_2003, @heinisch_2010a, @stumm_2002]. This chemokine has been shown to play an essential role in brain plasticity during development but also in regulating the activity of various brain circuits in normal and pathological conditions [@merino_2014, @timotijevi_2012, @tiveron_2008a]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that there are several cross-talks between the CXCL12 and with its receptor CXCR4 and other neurotransmitter systems in the brain (e.g. GABA, glutamate and endocannabinoids) [@heinisch_2010a, @heinisch_2011]. The neuromodulatory actions of CXCL12 have been observed in various neuronal populations, including the hippocampus [@kasiyanov_2008], cerebellum [@limatola_2000], MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area [@guyon_2005] (LHA), vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamus [@callewaere_2006], dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra [@guyon_2006], the dorsal raphe nucleus [@heinisch_2010a] and recently the amygdala [@yang_2016]. What is particularly interesting, CXCL12 has often similar effects in these various circuits (increase in glutamate and/or GABA synaptic activity), however these effects occur via different mechanisms, even within one structure. For example, in the dorsal raphe nucleus CXCL12 increases the frequency of recorded spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSC) in serotonergic neurons through a pre-synaptic mechanism, but decreases sIPSC amplitude via a post-synaptic mechanism in non-serotonergic neurons [@heinisch_2010a]. Moreover, CXCL12 often appears to exert opposite effects on neuronal function depending on its concentration, e.g. in MCH-expressing neurons of the LHA, where the action potential discharge is different depending on the concentration [@guyon_2005]. Of particular interest is the observation that pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation leads to elevated levels of CXCL12 and other chemokines by activation of glial or endothelial cells which in turn release chemokines [@guyon_2014]. The chemokines released bind to CXCR4 present on neurons and induce changes in excitability that could induce an adaptive response to inflammation, leading to “sickness behavior,” characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue [@dantzer_2001, @dantzer_2007]. Sickness behavior is considered to be the physiological and psychological effect of immune activation during the course of infection, which is primarily mediated by the central action of peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines. Given the abundance of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS, it is not surprising that changes of cytokine/chemokine levels during inflammation are causing multiple physiological and behavioral perturbations. For example, effects of CXCL12 on dorsal raphe neurons could underlie depressive symptoms frequently observed with inflammation [@maes_1998], as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression. Similarly, the effects of CXCL12 on MCH neurons which are part of the feeding behavior and metabolism control circuit [@nahon_2006] could explain anorexia. These symptoms of sickness behavior are usually reversible when inflammation stops. Overall, this chemokine system is one of the key players in the neuro-immune interface that participates in shaping CNS responses to changes in the environment.

<!-- Unlike many chemokines whose expression is strongly up-regulated during inflammatory responses, the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 are constitutively and widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (Banisadr et al. 2002; Sanchez-Alcaniz et al. 2011; Schonemeier et al. 2008; Stumm et al. 2002; Stumm et al. 2003). -->

• CXCR7 is an interesting atypical chemokine receptor (Maksym et al., 2009). Together with CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12, CXCR7 is conserved well across the vertebrate species including sea lamprey (Nomiyama et al., 2011). It binds CXCL11 and CXCL12. Importantly, CXCR7 can heterodimerize with CXCR4 and modulate the effect of CXCL12 on CXCR4. Furthermore, CXCR7 can also signal in some cell types although not by the classical G protein-coupled receptor pathways (Maksym et al., 2009). During embryogenesis, CXCR7 is necessary for proper migration of primordial germ cells to CXCL12 via CXCR4 by acting as a sink for CXCL12 (Boldajipour et al., 2008). CXCR7 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007). Although poorly expressed in normal adult tissues, CXCR7 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors and tumor-associated vessels and appears to promote tumor growth and neoangiogenesis partly by signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Maksym et al., 2009).
• Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are known to reside in the bone marrow. Broxmeyer et al. (2005) reported that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced release of HSCs from the bone marrow, indicating that the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a key signal maintaining HSCs in the bone marrow. This observation had potential clinical utility, because certain cancer patients are candidates for whole-body irradiation followed by reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment via HSCs. Thus, the ability of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to release HSCs from the bone marrow meant that these ‘‘mobilized’’ HSCs could be isolated from the blood of the patient in sufficient numbers to permit repopulation with autologous HSCs (Uy et al., 2008). Interestingly, AMD3100 synergizes with granulocyte colony stimulating factor to mobilize HSCs, improving the effectiveness of the approach and allowing the isolation of enough cells for autologous cell transplantation. This combined approach has been used in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and with multiple myeloma (Pusic and DiPersio, 2010). Other CXCR4- based therapeutics have been reviewed recently (Peled et al., 2012).
• These developments underscore the important roles that CXCR4 plays in development. Other studies have documented that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays pivotal roles in homing of various stem cells to particular places of the embryo during development. One of the most useful experimental models to understand these mechanisms has been the zebrafish, where CXCR4 is the signal that guides stem cells that give rise to the gonads of the developing fish embryo (Doitsidou et al., 2002; Knaut et al., 2003). More recent studies have documented the coordinated roles of CXCR4, CXCL12, and CXCR7 in the development of the central nervous system in the zebrafish (Diotel et al., 2010; Tiveron and Cremer, 2008). Thus, certain homeostatic chemokine receptors play key roles in the homing of various stem cells. The ability of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in directing stem cell homing is probably related to its prominent role in directing the metastatic destination of tumor cells as well (Zlotnik et al., 2011)


 In the developing and mature brain, virtually all types of CNS cells such as neural progenitors, neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes as well as endothelial cells of brain blood vessels are targets for SDF-1 (Li and Ransohoff, 2008). Developmental aspects controlled by SDF-1 in the CNS include cell proliferation, migration, and (neuronal) cell survival (Li and Ransohoff, 2008). A recognized function of SDF-1 in the mature CNS is the control of intercellular communication between brain cells (Bezzi et al., 2001; Rostene et al., 2007). In the injured CNS, SDF-1 regulates inflammatory processes (Cartier et al., 2005; Li and Ransohoff, 2008) and promotes tissue regeneration by recruiting neural progenitor cells to the site of injury (Tran et al., 2007).
 CXCR7 shows a roughly 10 times higher binding affinity for SDF-1 as compared with CXCR4 (Balabanian et al., 2005; Crump et al., 1997) and additionally binds interferon-inducible T-cell a chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11) as a second ligand (Burns et al., 2006). receptor. Similar to the atypical chemokine receptors, D6 and CCX-CKR (Graham, 2009), CXCR7 contains a modified DRYLAIV motif; this motif is assumed to be essential for G protein binding (Thelen and Thelen, 2008)
 Moreover, several studies failed to demonstrate CXCR7-dependent activation of G proteins and subsequent Ca2 1-induced chemotaxis (Burns et al., 2006; Levoye et al., 2009; Rajagopal et al., 2010b; Sierro et al., 2007). Studies on the migration of primordial germ  cells  further  revealed  that  CXCR7  controls CXCR4-mediated cell migration by sequestering extracellular SDF-1 and, hence, shaping the extracellular chemokine  gradient  (Boldajipour  et  al.,  2008).  More recently, this scavenger function was additionally highlighted by the demonstration of a constant cycling of CXCR7 between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as well as a nonsaturating binding of SDF-1 to CXCR7 (Naumann et al., 2010).  Intriguingly, despite this atypical function, CXCR7 induces cell signaling in various types of tumor cells and controls their growth,  adhesion,  and  transendothelial  migration (Burns et al., 2006; Grymula et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Zabel et al., 2009). In addition, CXCR7-mediated cell signaling occurs in primary interneurons (Wang et al., 2011) Along the same line, we recently demonstrated that in primary astrocytes, SDF1-dependent activation of several signaling molecules/ pathways including Erk, Akt, and PKC  is entirely mediated by CXCR7 ( € Odemis et al., 2010). Since CXCR7 associates b -arrestin, it has been suggested that CXCR7 would affect cell function through a b -arrestin-dependent mechanism (Luker et al., 2009; Kalatskaya et al., 2009; Rajagopal et al., 2010a; Zabel et al., 2009). We now provide evidence that in primary rodent astrocytes and human astrocytoma cell lines, CXCR7 induces cell signaling and controls cell proliferation and migration through pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/oproteins. 
Along the same line, we observed that SDF1-induced increases in [Ca2 1]i are sensitive to the CXCR7 antagonist, CCX771 (Zabel et al., 2009), but not to the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD31000 (Hatse et al., 2002).
The  previously  reported  failure  of  SDF-1-bound CXCR7 to activate G proteins in nonastroglial cells has been primarily attributed to the fact that CXCR7 contains a modified DRYLAIV motif (Thelen and Thelen, 2008). This motif represents a highly conserved region within the second intracellular loop of GPCRs and is assumed to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation. Indeed, several established atypical chemokine receptors such as D6, DARC, and CCXCKR either lack the DRYLAIV motif or exhibit a modified motif (Graham, 2009). However, other chemokine receptors such as lymphotactin receptors and CXCR6, also showing modifications of the DRYLAIV motif, still signal through G proteins (Thelen and Thelen, 2008). These discrepancies are currently regarded as an indication that at least in case of some GPCRs the DRYLAIV motif is  not sufficient for  G protein  coupling and requires  additional  sequences  (Thelen  and  Thelen, 2008). Consequently, modifications  of  the DRYLAIV motif, as exhibited by CXCR7, may not per se represent a reliable indicator for the lack of G protein coupling.

**BIASED SIGNALLING**
Agonist binding to GPCR typically results in balanced G protein- and arrestin-mediated cell signaling (Rajagopal et al., 2010b). Biased signaling, through only one of these pathways, is either caused by a biased ligand or a biased receptor. While until now biased receptor function  has  only  been  observed  with  experimentally mutated  GPCRs,  a  recent  work  demonstrated  that CXCR7 acts as a biased receptor in HEK-293 cells and signals exclusively through b -arrestin (Rajagopal et al., 2010a). Notably, in astrocytes signaling of SDF-1-bound CXCR7 was sensitive to PTX, but was not affected by depletion of b -arrestin1 or b -arrestin2. Vice  versa , signaling of the alternative CXCR7 ligand, I-TAC (Burns et al., 2006), was unaffected by PTX, but was abolished following depletion of b -arrestin2. These findings are consistent with the view that CXCR7 functions as a ligandbiased receptor in astrocytes. Mechanistically, receptoror ligand-biased signaling of CXCR7 might be determined by whether or not SDF-1-bound CXCR7 couples to G proteins in a given cell type. 
 
 
 SDF-1 has been shown to act in the brain as a neurotransmitter  (Banisadr et al., 2005) and to be released with GABA from  inhibitory neurons (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008). 
 SDF-1 via CXCR4 coupled to G  i/o  has been shown to regulate  neuronal signaling through inhibition of voltage dependent  calcium (Ca  2+  ) currents (Oh et al., 2002), in particular the N-  type channel (Simen et al., 2001).
 However, SDF-1 also  activates GIRK channels (Guyon et al., 2005; Guyon and  Nahon, 2007) which GnRH neurons express (Hu et al., 2006;  Klenke et al., 2010). 
 
 Taken together, these data suggest that the small molecule and cyclic peptide block ligand binding by acting as orthosteric competitors of the CXCL12 N-terminal signaling trigger, providing strong support for the two-site model of binding. Along these lines, a recent NMR study showed that the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 could displace the CXCL12 N terminus from the receptor without displacing the chemokine core domain (58

   Banisadr 2016: CXCR7 in the brain (Schönemeier et al. 2008a , b ; Shimizu et al. 2011 ). Knowledge of the precise expression pattern and characterization of cells expressing CXCR7 is required to further explore the function of CXCR7 in the brain. It is well established that SDF-1/CXCL12 is constitutively expressed by endothelial and neuronal cells in various regions of the adult rat brain (Tham et al. 2001 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Banisadr et al. 2003 ) and the expression patterns of SDF-1/CXCL12 and CXCR4 have been well established in structures associated with various functions such as their role in adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation among other functions (Banisadr et al. 2002 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Tissir et al. 2004 ;Tranetal. 2007 ).
   
   
   CXCL12 is stored in vesicle like structures within neurons which seem to be neurotransmitter storage vesicles (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).
   It has been shown that the development of adult DG neural stem cells is regulated by the release of GABA from neurons of this type (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). Release of CXCL12 within the DG neural stem cell niche is able to enhance GABAergic transmission to neural stem cells (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). We observed that CXCL14 had essentially the opposite effect and could inhibit GABAergic inputs to these cells. The GABAergic input to DG neural stem cells takes the form of both tonic and phasic transmission. Interestingly, both tonic and phasic effects of synaptically released GABA were inhibited by CXCL14. We also observed that some cells responded to both CXCL12, which enhanced, and CXCL14, which decreased GABAergic transmission to nestin-expressing cells. Hence, it seems likely that CXCL12 and CXCL14 represent ‘up’ and ‘down’ volume controls that can regulate GABA inputs to neural stem cells in a reciprocal fashion. The fact that CXCL14 and CXCL12 are also both contained in DG GABAergic interneurons (Bhatta- charyya et al. 2008) increases the probability of a meaningful connection between the effects of these three molecules in the control of DG neuron development in the adult. By comparison neither CXCL14 nor CXCL12 altered GABAergic transmission to mature granule cells in the DG (Figure S3 and Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).
   
In our previous studies, we concluded that the effects of CXCL12 on DG neural stem cells were likely to be mediated  post-synaptically  (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). Indeed, CXCR4 receptors are clearly expressed by these cells (Tran et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). It is also clear from our experiments that adult neural stem cells express the receptor (or at least ‘a receptor’) for CXCL14. Thus, CXCL14 increased [Ca2+]iin these cells, one of the cardinal signs of chemokine receptor signaling. Given the fact that neural progenitor cells express the receptor for CXCL14 and the observation that the chemokine reduces the amplitude of GABAergic PSCs recorded from these cells one might conclude that the effect of CXCL14 is at least partly mediated post-synaptically. However, it is quite possible that a pre-synaptic effect is also involved. Precise identification of the mechanism by which CXCL14 produces its effect will have to await further studies on identifying its receptor and its location in the DG.

Guyon_2006
SDF-1 a increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to SDF-1 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by SDF-1 a . It is therefore likely that SDF-1 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.

It is well established that SDF-1 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the SDF-1 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of SDF-1 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.
