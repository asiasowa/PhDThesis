Finally, over the last decade, the notion that dysfunctions in chemokine system leads to neuropsychiatric diseases has attracted much attention (for a review @stuart_2015). <!--/// generated additional attention as a result of the discovery that in neocortex/// has attracted   much   attention. -->
Broadly, dysfunctions in the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pairs is similar to “sickness behavior”.
It is a physiological and psychological state characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines [@dantzer_2001; @dantzer_2007]. 
Given the described above modulation of the release of serotonin in the DRN as well as involvement in feeding behavior and learning by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 may affect mood and lead to depression [@maes_1998].
Accordingly, the link between those chemokines and chronic stress is well-documented [@sowa_2017; @zhan_2014; @piirainen_2021].<!-- więcej cytowań...--><!-- tabelka -->
<!-- Thus, the effect of CXCL12 on serotonergic neurons in the DRN could underlie depressive symptoms, as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression. --> 

Interestingly, initial behavioral evidence is starting to elucidate the possible increasing evidence also points to// mediation of those chemokine in anxiety-related behavior [@bols_2018; @schubert_2018].
Those types of behavior are widely accepted to be due to dysfunctions in functioning of the amygdala. 
Consistently, this region was reported to display relatively high expression of CX3CR1 and CXCR4. 
Moreover, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: @yang_2016). 

However, despite the relatively high expression of CXCR4 and CX3CR1 in the amygdala, a crucial structure in regulating stress response [@roozendaal_2009], which is also implicated in sickness behavior, and ,  and integrate  signals from endocrine and immune systems

<!-- Besides mentioned above behavioral phenotypes, CX3CR1^-/-^ knockout mice have been gaining attention in relation to chronic stress. -->


Amygdala is strategically positioned to regulate homeostatic function, and thus, one may speculate that it would be involved in integrating signals from endocrine and immune systems. 
It is supported by several lines of evidence. 
First, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages CeA and, to a lesser extent, the BLA [@engler_2011; @frenois_2007; @harrison_2009]. 
Peripheral signal of immune activation is thought to be mediated either *via*  activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting by proinflammatory cytokines and/or glucocorticoids to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to the amygdala, predominantly its central part (for a review: @vitkovic_2000; @critchley_2013).
Alternatively, this signal activates the HPA axis, which is also connected with the amygdala [@diiorio_2017; @green_2007; @herman_2005]. 


Second, mounting evidence illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part. 
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders [@girgenti_2017; @tovote_2015; @yang_2016], epilepsy [@fabene_2010; @roseti_2013; @suleymanova_2021; @tian_2017], obesity [@guillemotlegris_2017; @kawamura_2021], pain [@mlikparsadaniantz_2015; @old_2012; @paretkar_2019; @yuan_2020], drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; @coller_2012, @freeman_2012, @jacobsen_2016; @wang_2012).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.

Third, many recent studies demonstrating glial involvement in behavior, including the amygdala [@althammer_2020; @martinfernandez_2017]. 
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors. 

Finally, several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@nishiyori_1998; @tarozzo_2003]<!-- dodać CXCR4, CXCR7 CYTOWANIA-->, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala. 
Surprisingly, despite many similarities between the amygdala network and chemokine system dysfunctions, the electrophysiological role of chemokines in this structure is still unclear.<!--  -->

Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit. <!-- napisać lepsze podsumowanie.... Overall, this chemokine system is one of the key players in the neuro-immune interface that shapes CNS responses to changes in the environment. While much effort has been made to investigate the mechanisms underlying CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3-mediated regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity and their specific properties in certain synapses and brain regions, their impact on network function and animal behavior have only been initially explored. Taken together, the relevance of the actions mentioned above of CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling to mechanisms implicated in many neurobiological disorders is suggestive of -->
