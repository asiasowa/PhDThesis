### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 {#CXCL12}

#### CXCL12 structure {#CXCL12str}

CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily.
In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`,  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B5")`, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C6")`), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa [@yu_2006]. 
The `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one [@yu_2006].
Hence, as used here, the term "CXCL12" refers to the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation.  
It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. <!-- citation i trochę zmienić...-->
However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological processes (for a review: @britton_2021). <!-- zmienić trochę --> 
CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-sheet held in close apposition to an `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation [@murphy_2007; @wu_2010].
CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7.
All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species [@nomiyama_2013; @nomiyama_2015].
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 [@balabanian_2005]. 

#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 expression {#cxcl12expr}

CXCL12, along with their receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, is constitutively expressed and widely distributed in the CNS, both during neurodevelopment and adulthood [@banisadr_2002a; @schnemeier_2008; @stumm_2002; @stumm_2003]. <!-- They are widely distributed across the CNS. /// CXCL12 is another chemokine which has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive distribution in the CNS as well as the fact that it can be produced not only by glial cells but also by neurons [@banisadr_2003, @heinisch_2010a, @stumm_2002].--><!-- Unlike many chemokines whose expression is strongly up-regulated during inflammatory responses, the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 are constitutively and widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (Banisadr et al. 2002; Sanchez-Alcaniz et al. 2011; Schonemeier et al. 2008; Stumm et al. 2002; Stumm et al. 2003). -->
Moreover, these molecules are present in nearly all CNS cell types, including endothelial, glial, and notably neuronal cells.
Specifically, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-localized with many neuropeptides, for example, in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA)[@guyon_2006]. <!--CXCL12, together with its corresponding receptor, CXCR4, are constitutively expressed in the dopaminergic neurons (DA) of the SN (see: \@ref(expr)).  ( Banisadr et al., 2000, 2002a, 2005a,b, 2003 ).--><!-- czy ACKR3 też????? -->
Furthermore, ACKR3 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in the same neuronal [@shimizu_2011] and astrocytic populations [@odemis_2010]. 
In neurons, prominent cytoplasmic expression of ACKR3 was demonstrated, whereas CXCR4 was found on the cell membrane [@shimizu_2011], suggesting that ACKR3 may affect CXCR4 trafficking and/or coupling to other proteins [@shimizu_2011].
Consistently, ACKR3 up-regulation was shown to enhance heterodimer formation with CXCR4, which further resulted in its internalization and degeneration [@utokonomi_2013].
Moreover, as described in detail in Section Biased signaling (\@ref(biasedsignaling)), there is a possibility that in certain cellular contexts, CXCL12 might trigger different ACKR3- or CXCR4- signaling, which also could lead to either G protein-dependent or -independent biased response. <!-- poprawić-->
<!-- ACKR3 in the brain (Schönemeier et al. 2008a , b ; Shimizu et al. 2011 ). Knowledge of the precise expression pattern and characterization of cells expressing ACKR3 is required to further explore the function of ACKR3 in the brain. It is well established that CXCL12/CXCL12 is constitutively expressed by endothelial and neuronal cells in various regions of the adult rat brain (Tham et al. 2001 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Banisadr et al. 2003 ) and the expression patterns of CXCL12/CXCL12 and CXCR4 have been well established in structures associated with various functions such as their role in adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation among other functions (Banisadr et al. 2002 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Tissir et al. 2004 ;Tranetal. 2007 ).-->
<!-- subcellular
Confocal imaging of CXCR4 immunostaining as presented in this study clearly showed that in neurons of the caudate putamen the receptor is mostly located along the plasma membrane of perikarya and dendritic processes. Furthermore, CXCR4 in this region is also expressed in beaded Æbres that resemble varicosed axonal processes. A similar pattern of CXCR4 labelling was observed in the substantia innominata (not shown). This reinforces the hypothesis that CXCR4 activation could modulate synaptic transmission (Limatola et al ., 2000). Interestingly, a markedly different cellular localization of CXCR4 was observed in neurons from other brain regions such as the lateral hypothalamus. In these neurons, CXCR4 labelling was punctate and apparent throughout the cytoplasm of the perikaryon, and was barely visible in dendritic processes. This indicates that the cellular localization of CXCR4 may vary depending on the type of neurons that express the receptor. Although the functional consequences of this observation are unclear at present, it may suggest that speciÆc cellular mechanisms of CXCR4 addressing and trafÆcking could operate in different neuronal populations [@banisadr_2002a]-->
<!-- Finally, we addressed the striking mismatch between intense CXCR4 mRNA expression (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Tissir et al., 2004; Tran et al., 2007) and weak CXCR4 protein expression in the SGL (Stumm et al., 2002). Studies in non-neuronal cell lines showed that CXCR4 is sequestered from the cell surface (internalized), sorted to lysosomes, and degraded after agonist stimulation (Orsini et al., 1999; Marchese and Benovic, 2001). Therefore, the mismatch between CXCR4 mRNA and CXCR4 protein in the SGL may reflect tonic activation and turnover of CXCR4 by endogenous CXCL12-->
<!-- expression outside CNS
However, CXCL12 exhibits broad tissue expression including brain, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney,  spleen, and bone marrow. CXCR4 can be considered as a node which is integrating  and transducing inputs from a range of ligand-receptor interactions into a responsive  and divergent network of intracellular signaling pathways that impact multiple cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and stress resistance. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), originally  termed Fusin due to its role in cell-cell fusion12 and its expression was first described in peripheral blood leukocytes and  subsequently in hematopoietic stem cells, B-lymphocytes,  epithelial, endothelial, stromal fibroblasts, and cancer cells.13 -->
<!--Additionally, CXCR4 is often co-expressed with opioid receptors in neurons and astrocytes, frequently forming heterodimers [@burbassi_2010], whereas ACKR3 is implicated in chemokine-opioid interactions [@ikeda_2013, @meyrath_2020], illustrating interactions between chemokine and opioid systems (see Section: \@ref(opio), for review: @mlikparsadaniantz_2015).

#### CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling {#CXCL12signal}

Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, in addition to the enhancement of receptor-ligand binding, there is a subsequent GDP exchange for GTP, and the trimeric G~i~-protein dissociates into its constituent parts,  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~ and G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`~ (@ganju_1998; see Fig. \@ref(fig:cxcl12sig)). 
These molecules activate several intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review: @britton_2021, @ward_2006).  
PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). <!-- /// In parallel, CXCR4-oriented migration is mediated by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which can be activated by both G`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")``r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` and G `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` subunits [45]. -->
IP3 production leads to increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). 
Both intracellular free calcium and PKC promote the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and proliferation.  
In parallel, the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~i~ subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase and a consequent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in cell cycle entry and proliferation [@cheng_2015]. 
In addition to the well-characterized coupling to  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`i~, convincing evidence illustrates that CXCR4 can also bind to other G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`~ proteins such as G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~, G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`o~, and G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`s~ (for a comprehensive review: @pozzobon_2016; see Fig. \@ref(fig:cxcl12sig)).
For example, by binding to G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`12/13~, CXCR4 leads to Rho activation, whereas  G~`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`q~ signal through Rac activation. 
Moreover, it is well documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal pathway.

Following CXCR4 activation, G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are also activated, inducing the intracellular C-terminal domain phosphorylation, which, in turn, results in `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins recruitment. 
These molecules lead to the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and subsequent receptor internalization. 
Moreover, `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins were reported to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CXCR4, leading to receptor downregulation and trafficking to endosomal compartments [@denies_2019]. 

CXCL12 second receptor, ACKR3, like other ACKR receptors, contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs<!--see figure...--> [@thelen_2008].<!-- It is thought to be essential for G protein binding and their subsequent activation [@thelen_2008]-->
The modification of this motif is believed to unable the activation of G proteins and subsequent Ca^2+^-induced chemotaxis [@burns_2006; @levoye_2009; @rajagopal_2010a].
Thus, for a long time, as a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 was thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration [@naumann_2010].<!-- there was a prevailing notion that ACKR3 only sequesters CXCL12 extracellular gradient and thus control CXCR4-mediated cell migration. ////ACKR3's signaling pathways are discussed later in section "Biased Signaling" \@ref(biasedsignaling). skopiować z later...-->
However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 was also able to signal *via* `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin pathway [@rajagopal_2010a; @wang_2011].
Moreover, although CXCR4 and ACKR3 are activated by the same chemokine, they signal through different pathways (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin vs. G-coupled).
Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin biased receptor (see: \@ref(biasedsignaling)).
Nonetheless, more recently, it was shown that ACKR3 has functionality independent of the `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestins.
Specifically, [@montpas_2018] demonstrated that both siRNA knockdown of  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin 1 and or `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells does not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of ACKR3's ligands (e.i., CXC11 and CXCL12). 
In addition, the following studies further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ levels following the activation of PTX-sensitive G~i/o~ proteins, leading to proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes [@odemis_2010].  
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: @bajetto_2001a), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor [@odemis_2012]. 
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells.
Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist [@burns_2006], resulted in activation of `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting [@odemis_2012].  
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.  
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification.

Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs  astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Cx43 internalization in a `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin2-dependent manner [@fumagalli_2020], whereas CXCR4 leads to NF-K`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` activation with consequent TNF-`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` and glutamate release from these cells [@bezzi_2001; @cal_2008; @cal_2010].
Therefore, these data suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions *via* different signaling pathways in astrocytes, indicating that, in particular cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019].

#### Astrocytes

Astrocytes, which were considered as supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, network oscillations, and behavior [@perea_2009, @mederos_2019]. <!-- Astrocytes are specialized cells, organized in non-overlapping domains within the CNS parenchyma and coupled into multicellular networks via gap junctions ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010 ). -->
Being organized into microdomains and coupled into multicellular astrocytic networks *via* gap junctions, they are highly specialized cells (for a review: @khakh_2015). 
Furthermore, astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites and synapses.<!-- citations-->
For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte make contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in  rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans [@oberheim_2009], suggesting bidirectional communication. <!-- A single cortical astrocyte is estimated to contact 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in  rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans [@oberheim_2009]./// Observational studies from postmortem human tissues have revealed that human astrocytes are much larger and more complex than their murine counterparts (Oberheim et al., 2006, Oberheim et al., 2009). More recently, transplantation of human glial progenitors into mouse brains has been shown to improve learning and memory (Han et al., 2013). These observations raise questions about how murine astrocyte physiology and function might extend to humans. Are there distinct properties of human astrocytes that contribute to human intelligence and cognition? Can we extend findings about astrocyte pathology in neurological disorders from mouse and rat studies to develop effective therapeutic approaches in humans?--><!-- They are prominently found in proximity of nerve terminals, sensing neural activity and being activated during synaptic transmission.--><!-- Several lines of evidence suggest that,  through this close association with neurons, astrocytes alter synaptic functions.--><!-- Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission [ 33 , 34 ], long-term potentiation [ 34 – 40 ],  and long-term depression [ 15 ] in several brain areas, as well as provide a developmental switch  of synaptic transmission from LTD to LTP in hippocampus [ 41 ]. --><!-- Astrocytes can also modulate synaptic transmission by releasing transmitters In agreement with this hypothesis is the observation that astrocyte stimulation in mice’s primary sensory areas increases neural firing beyond stimulation (Perea et al., 2014; Poskanzer et al., 2016). --><!--A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote synapses formation, are defective in phagocytosis, and release soluble factors that induce apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes ( Zamanian et al., 2012; Liddelow et al., 2017 ). A2 reactive astrocytes might have protective/reparative functions, since they upregulate neurotrophic factors and thrombospondins (which promote synapses repair) ( Liddelow and Barres, 2017 ). These and other evidence support the notion that the interplay among neurons, microglia and astrocytes orchestrates the endogenous response to limit brain damage upon toxic insult. Trettel2020--><!--Astrocytes are essential for brain homeostasis affecting: i) the blood – brain barrier (BBB) integrity; ii) the cerebral blood flow, fluid, ion, pH and transmitter homeostasis; iii) the synaptic function, being components of the (tripartite) synapsis and releasing gliotransmitters; iv) the CNS metabolism regulating energy supply to neurons ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010 ). Upon acute brain insults or chronic brain diseases (such as neurodegenerative disease, brain tumor, epilepsy) astrocytes become reactive and undergo morphological, transcriptional and functional changes that can be either beneficial or detrimental ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Liddelow and Barres, 2017 ). Trettel2020-->
Indeed, they are endowed with a great variety of ion channels and receptors [@olsen_2015, @seifert_2018, @kofuji_2021] to react to changing microenvironment as well as they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters [@araque_2014, @savtchouk_2018, @covelo_2018]. <!-- bidirectional communication :) // Since the tripartite synapse concept emerged in 1999 [@araque_1999], it is well-established that astrocytes are involved in the dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission (for example: @araque_2014).To react to changing microenvironment, they are endowed with a great variety of voltage and ligand-operated  ion  channels [@kofuji_2021]. -->
Ca^2+^ levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca^2+^ levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission. <!-- nie podoba mi się to zdanie // Astrocytes display a wide variety of Ca^2+^ signals, particularly relevant in astrocytic signaling, as Ca^2+^ fluctuations are thought to integrate environmental information  and  generate  functional outputs, such as releasing gliotransmitters, including glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` [@araque_2014, @guerragomes_2017].   -->
Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca^2+^ elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews [@araque_2014, @guerragomes_2017, @bazargani_2016].
Thus, astrocytes can both react to and release the set of chemokines (for example: @dorf_2000; @mckimmie_2010; @sowa_2017).<!--more citations--> 
<!-- nie wiem czy tutaj to o gap junction, ja bym o tym tylko wspomniała wcześniej, a potem rozbudowała...
Moreover, astrocytes are enriched in gap junctions, by which they form broad cellular networks comprised of hundreds of cells, allowing for the intercellular diffusion of ions, second messengers, cyclic AMP, Ca^2+^, glutamate, ATP, among others.Gap junctions are formed by connexins, mainly by Cx43 and Cx30, which differ in their expression.Despite their scale, such networks were illustrated to preferentially couple one astrocyte over the other. Therefore, neighboring astrocytes may not necessarily be connected by gap junctions, and such preference may be of functional relevance.Moreover, gap junction networks were demonstrated to play an essential role in complex brain functions, including cognition and behavior (for a review: @guerragomes_2017). As ACKR3 was demonstrated to induce the internalization of Cx43 [@fumagalli_2020], future studies aimed at establishing its functional significance and whether other chemokine receptors may elicit similar actions are warranted. --><!--Furthermore, ACKR3 activation promotes β-arrestin2- and dynamin-dependent Cx43 internalization to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication in primary astrocytes. @fumagalli_2020

It is  of interest to understand how these subcellular mechanisms in astrocytes and their processes are linked with synaptic transmission and plasticity in neocortex [ 13 , 15 , 42 , 50 , 51 ]. [@manninen_2020]
Interestingly, the GABA transporters (GATs) GAT-1 and GAT-3 show particular cellular and sub-cellular distributions throughout the brain (Ribak et al., 1996; Boisvert et al., 2018). GAT-3 is the most abundant GAT in astrocytes and is localized in astrocytic processes that are adjacent to synapses and cell bodies, but are also close to basal and apical dendrites (Boddum et al., 2016), while GAT-1 can be found in distal astrocytic processes and is more abundant in neurons (Borden, 1996; Scimemi, 2014). -->

#### CXC12 actions in the brain

Considering that virtually all types of brain cells express either CXCL12 and/or one of its receptor, this chemokine serves a wide array of functions in both the developing and mature brain.<!-- zmienić trochę to zdanie?? // In the developing and mature brain, virtually all types of CNS cells such as neural progenitors, neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes as well as endothelial cells of brain blood vessels are targets for CXCL12 (Li and Ransohoff, 2008).// ŁADNE ZDANIE ALE TROCHĘ ZMIENIĆ --><!--Despite structural difference and the activation of different chemokine receptors, CXCL12 and CX3CL1 share many similar roles in the healthy brain, at least to some extend.  also is an important player in regard to neurodevelopment. /// beznadziejne zdanie... /// It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001).-->
Indeed, several lines of evidence illustrate that CXCL12 is involved in neurodevelopment, mainly by controlling cell proliferation, migration, and survival. <!-- Developmental aspects controlled by CXCL12 in the CNS include cell proliferation, migration, and (neuronal) cell survival (Li and Ransohoff, 2008). zmienić /// CXCL12/CXCR4 pair modulates cerebral cortex (Bagri et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2003; Stumm and Höllt, 2007) and cerebellar (Ma et al., 1998; Zou et al., 1998) development. -->
For instance, CXCL12 is associated with both developmental and adult neurogenesis. 
<!-- proliferation + adult neurogenesis /// Another analogous action that is similar to CX3CL1 is CXCL12 implication in the regulation of neurogenesis.-->
Indeed, the expression of CXCL12 and its receptors is relatively high in embryonic and adult neural progenitor cells [@tran_2004].
<!--coś o neurogenezie w młodości -->
Accordingly, CXC12 is found to be a key player in neurogenesis during development of, among others, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [@lysko_2011; @pujol_2005].
On the other hand, the adult brain neurogenesis is restricted to two neurogenic regions, e.i., the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) near the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. <!-- better written, citations --> 
It is well established that CXCL12 is responsible for generation and positioning of new neurons within these niches, as well as their axonal and dendritic outgrowth and branching  [@abe_2015; @abe_2018; @zhu_2017].<!--The expression of CXCL12 in the hippocampal granular layer regulates the generation and the positioning of new granule neurons (Abe et al., 2018), as well as axonal elongation and sprouting (Pujol et al., 2005; Lysko et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012). /// The chemokine CXCL12 (C-X-C motif ligand 12) and its signaling receptor CXCR4 (C-X-C motif receptor 4) represent an important pathway that regulates homing and maintenance of stem cells in neural niches-->
<!-- może tutaj dodać o neurogenezie po urazach???? --- In addition, CXCL12 is also well-documented to be upregulated after different insults, including ....-induced generating of new neurons According to its role in neurogenesis, the upregulation of CXCL12 upon stroke (Wang et al., 2012), or demyelination (Carbajal et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2014) contributes to generate new cells and to restore normal CNS functions tRETTEL2020--><!-- Indeed, CXCL12 stimulates astrocytes promoting Akt phosphorylation ( Khan et al., 2004 ), G-protein-induced///activated ERK1/2 signaling cascade leading to cell proliferation ( Bajetto et al., 2001b ) in astrocytes,-->
Adult neurogenesis, especially near SGZ, is linked to memory.
Consistently, after learning, CXCR4 level was documented to be increased in CA3 [@su_2012]. 

CXCL12 was also reported to guide neural progenitors [@bhattacharyya_2008; @casoni_2012; @tran_2003].<!--Moreover, GABA, together with CXCL12, were reported to synergistically to alter cell movement and promote maturation of interneurons during neurodevelopment and later in the adulthood [@bhattacharyya_2008; @casoni_2012]. Regarding cell migration, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was, for instance, demonstrated to guide interneurons (for example: @bhattacharyya_2008 and @casoni_2012) and promote the maturation of GABAergic neurons during neurodevelopment [@luo_2008]. CXCL12, a chemokine, is  involved in primordial germ cell migration (Blaser et al., 2005),  migration of neural progenitors (via its receptor CXCR4) and axon  growth and branching during development of the nervous system  (Tran and Miller, 2003; Pujol et al., 2005).///  Recent work has shown  that GABA and CXCL12 may act synergistically to alter cell  movement (Seidel et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008). [@casoni_2012]-->
Importantly, as interneurons are guided to the correct destination by CXCL12 gradient, ACKR3, by acting as a "sink" to collect excess CXCL12, also is implicated in this phenomenon [@snchezalcaiz_2011].<!-- Interneurons are guided to the correct cortical layer via CXCL12 gradients while  ACKR3 acts as a sink to collect excess CXCL12. [@snchezalcaiz_2011] //  <!-- (Boldajipour et al., 2008).!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-->
Moreover, a recent study further demonstrated that ACKR3-mediated scavenging and endocytosis of CXCL12 was dependent on receptor phosphorylation rather than `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-arrestin signaling [@saaber_2019]. <!--Similarly, Saaber et al. demonstrate that ACKR3 chemokine scavenging and endocytosis is dependent on receptor phosphorylation but independent of β-arrestins.

Neuronal growth and synapse formation can also be achieved by a phenomenon called giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs).
GDPs are spontaneous network-driven rhythmic-like large neuronal oscillations in the developing hippocampus, formed by GABA, exerting depolarizing and excitatory actions during postnatal development. 
CXCL12 was reported to tonically inhibit GDPs,  further highlighting the role of this chemokine in neuronal development [@benari_2002].Moreover, they are modulated by external factors, including chemokines, such as  CXCL12 and CX3CL1 [@meucci_1998; @liu_2003; @sheridan_2014].??? sprawdzić czy nie chodzi o calcium --><!-- CXCR4 and neurodevelopment 
These developments underscore the important roles that CXCR4 plays in development. 
Other studies have documented that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays pivotal roles in homing of various stem cells to particular places of the embryo during development.
In zebrafish, a cannonical model of the developmental studies, ... More recent studies have documented the coordinated roles of CXCR4, CXCL12, and ACKR3 in the development of the central nervous system in the zebrafish (Diotel et al., 2010; Tiveron and Cremer, 2008). 
Thus, certain homeostatic chemokine receptors play key roles in the homing of various stem cells.  -->
In addition, CXCL12 was shown to enhance GABAergic transmission within DG neurogenic niche, which, in turn, is implicated in maturation of adult neural stem cells within this structure [@bhattacharyya_2008].<!--
It has been shown that the development of adult DG neural stem cells is regulated by the release of GABA from neurons of this type (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). Release of CXCL12 within the DG neural stem cell niche is able to enhance GABAergic transmission to neural stem cells (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).--><!--We observed that CXCL14 had essentially the opposite effect and could inhibit GABAergic inputs to these cells.--><!--The GABAergic input to DG neural stem cells takes the form of both tonic and phasic transmission.Interestingly, both tonic and phasic effects of synaptically released GABA were inhibited by CXCL14. We also observed that some cells responded to both CXCL12, which enhanced, and CXCL14, which decreased GABAergic transmission to nestin-expressing cells.Hence, it seems likely that CXCL12 and CXCL14 represent ‘up’ and ‘down’ volume controls that can regulate GABA inputs to neural stem cells in a reciprocal fashion. The fact that CXCL14 and CXCL12 are also both contained in DG GABAergic interneurons (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008) increases the probability of a meaningful connection between the effects of these three molecules in the control of DG neuron development in the adult. By comparison neither CXCL14 nor CXCL12 altered GABAergic transmission to mature granule cells in the DG (Figure S3 and Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). -->
CXCL12-induced modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission is also present during adulthood and will be described later in this section. <!-- + GABAergic transmission-->
Importantly, as adult neurogenesis is known to  be an important player in memory, CXCL12 was also shown to be upregulated after learning [@su_2012]. <!-- ładniej napisać to zdanie... -->

The first evidence was the observation that  CXCL12  reduces the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons induced by gp120 or by glia deprivation [@meucci_1998].
Moreover, this chemokine was shown to inhibit NR2B [@nicolai_2010], a NMDA receptor subunit which is predominantly located extrasynaptically [@ivanov_2006; @lveill_2008]. 
Their activation due to excessive glutamate are thought to be neurotoxic.
Thus, CXCL12 is believed to reduce NMDA-induced calcium responses associated with decreased neuronal death [@nicolai_2010].<!-- lepiej opisać /// CXCL12 selectively inhibits NR2B expression in vitro and in vivo altering NMDA-induced calcium responses associated with neuronal death, while promoting prosurvival pathways that depend on stimulation of synaptic receptors.

<!-- Another novel neuroprotective activity of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been identified in its ability to increase dendritic spine numbers ( Pitcher et al., 2014 ). In particular authors found that, in opiate abuser and in neuroAIDS patients, deregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 is determinant to cognitive dysfunction associated with dendritic spine loss. The authors also demonstrated that CXCL12/CXCR4 regulates dendritic spine density both in vitro, in pure neuronal cultures, and in vivo, in a rat model of opiate abuse. -->
<!--In addition, the upregulation and the increased release of CXCL12 is also often observed during pathological states, for example, in astrocytes during ischemia--><!-- The upregulation and the release of CXCL12 from astrocytes was also observed in the ischemic penumbra (Stumm et al., 2002; Hill et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2005). 
In vitro, ischemia alters the expression of miRNAs associated with CXCL12 regulation, leading to increased CXCL12 expression and release from astrocytes ( Shin et al., 2014 ). 
In addition, acting on microglial cells, CXCL12 activates signaling pathways that trigger the release of IL-6 ( Lu et al., 2009 ), which has neuroprotective properties in ischemia ( Loddick et al., 1998; Ali et al., 2000; Ohtaki et al., 2006 ). -->
<!-- Another neuroprotective aspect regulated by CXCL12 is an inhibition increase in the pro-survival signaling of synaptic NMDA receptor, and in the downregulation of the extrasynaptic NR2B-NMDA receptor subunit (whose activity is known to mediate neurotoxicity ( Nicolai et al., 2010 ). /// Consistently, CXCL12 neuroprotective role neuroprotection is also sustained by an increase in the pro-survival signaling of synaptic NMDA receptor, and in the down-regulation of the extrasynaptic NR2B-NMDA receptor subunit (whose activity is known to mediate neurotoxicity) ( Nicolai et al., 2010 ).  /// Since all the experiments presented in the above cited papers were performed using neuronal cultures with a separate astrocytes layer, it cannot be excluded that the neuroprotective effects might be also mediated by glial cells. // Indeed, CXCL12 stimulates astrocytes promoting Akt phosphorylation ( Khan et al., 2004 ), G-protein-PI-3Kinase-ERK1/2 signaling cascade leading to cell proliferation ( Bajetto et al., 2001b ), NF-Kb activation with consequent TNFα (Han, 2001) and glutamate release// Recently it has been reported that gliptin (Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 DPP-4 inhibitor) improves motor functions and reduces tissue damage upon MCAO, increasing the cerebral level of CXCL12 ( Chiazza et al., 2018 ).

Furthermore, a decreased expression of CXCL12 was observed in the brain of Tg2576 and in 3XTg AD animal models at the stage of cognitive decline, as well as in brain tissue from AD patients ( Parachikova and Cotman, 2007).-->

Thus, abovementioned findings strongly indicate that CXCL12 could modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. 
Consistently, in the cerebellum, CXCR4 activation results in a decrease in NMDAR function, and thus, leads to synaptic depression [@ragozzino_2002].<!-- , probably by CXCL12-induced reduction in NR2B expression subunit of NMDAR [@nicolai_2010]. na ile to prawda? nie bardziej aktywacja NR2B przyczynia się do LTD? sprawdzić -->
Moreover, CXCR4 receptors were shown to be presynaptically located in hippocampal noradrenergic and glutamatergic nerve endings.
They were connected with presynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting that CXCR4-NMDAR interactions can regulate both noradrenaline and glutamate exocytosis [@diprisco_2016]. 
In addition, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the substantia nigra (SN), the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN [@guyon_2005; @guyon_2006; @heinisch_2010; @ragozzino_1998].<!--CXCL12 depresses the evoked input of the parallel fibers to Purkinje neurons ( Giovannelli et al., 1998; Ragozzino et al., 1998, 2002 ). trettel--><!-- sprawdzić... // CXCL12 has been shown to act in the brain as a neurotransmitter  (Banisadr et al., 2005) and to be released with GABA from  inhibitory neurons (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008).

However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin, MCH, DA<!-- dodać inne + cytowania-->), <!--together with ...., -->postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved in this phenomenon. <!--In addition, CXCL12 was reported to co-localize with neurons releasing neuropeptides, such as vasopressin (AVP) and MCH in posterior pituitary neurons, and substance P in DRG neurons (see Sections: \@ref(cell)). -->
For instance, electrophysiological recordings of supraoptic neurons have demonstrated that CXCL12 decreases the electrical activity of AVP neurons *via* CXCR4, resulting in reduced AVP release [@callewaere_2006].<!-- Consistent with this data, intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12 were illustrated to significantly inhibit the release of AVP induced by high plasma osmolarity . -->
Similarly, in MCH neurons,  CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na^+^ and K^+^ channels of the action potential in MCH neurons [@guyon_2005], or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents in hypothalamic neurons [@guyon_2005a].
However, considering that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in these neurons <!-- citations -->, it is tempting to speculate that autocrine regulation might be implicated in these ... <!--These findings also elucidate that CXCL12 cognate receptor, CXCL12, may be implicated in the autocrine regulation of these neurons. -->
Considering that the hypothalamus, a brain region comprised of different nuclei and several neuronal populations producing neuropeptides, is critically involved in the regulation of major neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and also stress, one could speculate that CXCL12 signaling may be involved in these functions.
In line with this notion, dysfunctions in CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia.
Not only a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides (e.g. enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the PVN and perifornical lateral hypothalamus, but also intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus[@poon_2016]. 
These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior. <!-- Both SDF-1 and GABA have been shown to  regulate the rate of GnRH neuronal migration by accelerating and slowing migration, respectively. As such, this system was used to  explore the mechanism by which these molecules act to produce coordinated cell movement during development.

GABA and SDF-1 were also found to act  synergistically to promote linear rather than random movement. The simultaneous activation of these signaling pathways, therefore,  results in tight control of cellular speed and improved directionality along the migratory pathway of GnRH neurons.  -->
Importantly, depending on the concentration, CXCL12 is thought to exert opposite effects on the action potential discharge in MCH neurons [@guyon_2005], which may have functional consequences on the activity of neuroendocrine functions.
Precisely, CXCR4 was reported to be tonically active at low physiological concentrations, constantly exerting its action on MCH neurons. <!-- whereas its activation lead to ... -->
Consistently, under basal conditions, those cells showed more hyperpolarized membrane potential than orexin neurons, which do not express CXCR4 [@eggermann_2003]. 

The dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of both pre- and post-synaptic actions of CXCL12. 
CXCL12 was reported to enhance the frequency of sIPSCs and mIPSCs in this region, indicating  presynaptic mechanisms, which is consistent with the documented presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons [@guyon_2006].
In addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 can act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of HVA currents [@guyon_2008a].

Interestingly, following CXCL12 application, SN dopaminergic neurons have shown an increase in an inward current [@guyon_2006].
This effect was independent on CXCR4 receptor, action potential-dependent sodium channel, and GABA~A~ receptors [@guyon_2006], suggesting that this chemokine may induce glutamate release from astrocytes.<!-- Interestingly, the observed CXCL12-induced increase in Glu was independent of CXCR4 receptor. It was speculated that its source might be glutamate secreted from non-neural cells [@guyon_2006]. -->
Consistently, immunohistological analyses revealed that astrocytes in this structure lacked CXCR4, further supporting the possibility of astrocytic mediation [@guyon_2006]. 
Considering abovementioned expression of another ACKR3 receptor in astrocytes, it is possible that this receptor is responsible for this CXCL12-induced increase in glutamate. 
Alternatively, it may be also mediated on CXCR4-expressing microglial cells. <!--As CXCR4 was not present on astrocytic cells in the SN [@guyon_2008], thus this inward current likely resulted from the activation of CXCR4 on microglia and/or ACKR3 activation.--> 
However, the exact mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release still warrants further investigation.<!-- CXCL12 a increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12 a . It is therefore likely that CXCL12 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice. It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation. -->

It is widely accepted that TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` mediates synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity leading to the adjustment of synaptic strength [@stellwagen_2006] and mainly astrocytes, have been identified as the main source of the TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` in the CNS.
Therefore, by modulating TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity [@stellwagen_2006].

<!-- dodać gdzieś jeszcze GIRK???? 
Interestingly, CXCR4 is associated with outward TTX-sensitive G protein-coupled inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel.
This current was shown to be prevented by applying the GABA~B~ antagonist, suggesting GABA spillover onto GABA~B~ receptors [@guyon_2007] as well as CXCR4-exerted actions by additional GABAergic receptor./// CXCL12 induced changes in saltatory GnRH movement  were shown to occur through a GIRK dependent mechanism.  GIRK channels open via a signal transduction cascade triggered  by the G  bc  dimeric protein released by activated G protein-  coupled receptors (Dascal, 1997; Yamada et al., 1998). Opening  of the GIRK channel results in permeability to potassium ions  and hyperpolarization of the cell.

#### Opioids {#opio}

Convincing evidence illustrates that opioid receptors and  CKRs are often co-expressed in the same neuron and can directly interact, thus each influencing the function of the other (see Section: \@ref(cxcl12)). 
The most studied mechanism in this regard is the heterologous desensitization, where the  activation of one type of GPCR receptor leads to the inactivation of another GPCR receptor present in the same cell.
Consistent with this idea, following CXCL12 exposure, the heterologous desensitization of opioid receptors has been linked to functional outcomes at cellular (e.g. reduced chemotaxis [@szabo_2002]) and electrophysiological (e.g. decreased morphine-induced hyperpolarization in PAG neurons in the presence of CXCL12 [@heinisch_2011]) levels. <!-- Phosphorylation is an   essential step for heterologous desensitization. Such phosphorylated   receptors lose their capacity to couple to the   downstream heterotrimeric G protein and   therefore become insensitive to stimulation.   -->

A recent elegant study has provided extensive<!--novel?new?--> evidence that ACKR3 is a chemokine receptor with the ability to bind opioid peptides; however opioid binding did not trigger downstream signaling through this receptor [@meyrath_2020].
Thus, it is suggested that ACKR3 serves scavenger functions for many opioids, especially enkephalins and dynorphins, by reducing their availability for their classical opioid receptors [@meyrath_2020]. 
Accordingly, treatment with ACKR3 agonist LIH383, even at high concentration, did not produce any electrophysiological effect in PAG<!--or locus coruleus?--> neurons, confirming the scavenging function of ACKR3 in this brain region.
Interestingly, in the presence of the ACKR3 agonist, dynorphin A improved its potency towards its classical receptors, which resulted in more significant inhibition of neuronal firing than in the absence of ACKR3 activation [@meyrath_2020]. 
These findings suggest that ACKR3 regulates opioid peptide availability, and consequently its signaling through their classical receptors [@meyrath_2020], adding another level of complexity and fine-tuning to the opioid system but also opens additional therapeutic opportunities.

Consistent with this idea, ACKR3 was reported to bind intermediate opioid peptides, specifically BAM22 and peptide E, which results in enhancement of circadian glucocorticoid oscillation in the adrenal glands, and, therefore, anxiolytic-like behavior [@ikeda_2013]. <!-- może poprawic albo wrocić do innej wersji? -->
BAM22 and peptide E were shown to be released under a condition named subcapsular cell hyperplasia (SCH) [@ikeda_2013], which is a pathohistological change of adrenal tissue.
SCH cells lack prohormone convertase, an enzyme required for processing these proteins to mature enkephalins [@ikeda_2013].
Therefore, this study highlights the functional relevance of chemokine and opioid systems interactions.

##### sickness behavior, nie wiem czy nie do behavior-->

What is worth noting is that ...
The chemokines released bind to CXCR4 present on neurons and induce changes in excitability that could induce an adaptive response to inflammation, leading to “sickness behavior,” characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue [@dantzer_2001, @dantzer_2007]. <!-- zmienić -->
Sickness behavior is considered to be the physiological and psychological effect of immune activation during the course of infection, which is primarily mediated by the central action of peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines. <!-- zmienić -->
Given the abundance of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS, it is not surprising that changes of cytokine/chemokine levels during inflammation are causing multiple physiological and behavioral perturbations. <!-- zmienić -->
For example, effects of CXCL12 on dorsal raphe neurons could underlie depressive symptoms frequently observed with inflammation [@maes_1998], as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression.<!-- zmienić -->
Similarly, the effects of CXCL12 on MCH neurons which are part of the feeding behavior and metabolism control circuit [@nahon_2006] could explain anorexia. <!-- zmienić -->

ACKR3 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007).
