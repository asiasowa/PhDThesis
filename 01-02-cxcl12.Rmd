## Chemokines and amygdala

Amygdala is strategically positioned to regulate homeostatic function, and thus, one may speculate that it would be involved in integrating signals from endocrine and immune systems. <!-- jakieś lepsze intro...

It is supported by several lines of evidence. <!-- review how immune system sub the brain -->
First, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages CeA and, to a lesser extent, the BLA [@engler_2011; @frenois_2007; @harrison_2009]. 
Peripheral signal of immune activation is thought to be mediated either *via*  activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting by proinflammatory cytokines and/or glucocorticoids to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to the amygdala, predominantly its central part (for a review: @vitkovic_2000; @critchley_2013).
Alternatively, this signal activates the HPA axis, which is also connected with the amygdala [@diiorio_2017; @green_2007; @herman_2005]. 
Moreover, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: @yang_2016). 

Second, mounting evidence illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part. 
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders [@girgenti_2017; @tovote_2015; @yang_2016], epilepsy [@fabene_2010; @roseti_2013; @suleymanova_2021; @tian_2017], obesity [@guillemotlegris_2017; @kawamura_2021], pain [@mlikparsadaniantz_2015; @old_2012; @paretkar_2019; @yuan_2020], drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; @coller_2012, @freeman_2012, @jacobsen_2016; @wang_2012).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.

Third, many recent studies demonstrating glial involvement in behavior, including the amygdala [@althammer_2020; @martinfernandez_2017]. 
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors. 

Finally, several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@nishiyori_1998; @tarozzo_2003]<!-- dodać CXCR4, CXCR7 CYTOWANIA-->, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala. 
Surprisingly, despite many similarities between the amygdala network and chemokine system dysfunctions, the electrophysiological role of chemokines in this structure is still unclear.<!--  -->
