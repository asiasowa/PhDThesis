Finally, over the last decade, the notion that dysfunctions in the chemokine system lead to neuropsychiatric diseases has attracted much attention (for a review @stuart_2015).
Broadly, dysfunctions in the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pairs are similar to “sickness behavior”.
It is a physiological and psychological state characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines [@dantzer_2001; @dantzer_2007]. 
Given the described above, modulation of the release of serotonin in the DRN as well as involvement in feeding behavior and learning by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 may affect mood and lead to depression [@maes_1998].
Accordingly, the link between those chemokines and chronic stress is well-documented [@sowa_2017; @zhan_2014; @piirainen_2021]. 

Interestingly, initial behavioral evidence is starting to elucidate the possible mediation of those chemokines in anxiety-related behavior [@bols_2018; @schubert_2018; @yang_2016].
Those types of behavior are widely accepted to be due to dysfunctions in the functioning of the amygdala. 
Consistently, this region was reported to display relatively high expression of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 [@nishiyori_1998; @tarozzo_2003], strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala. 

Moreover, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages the amygdala [@engler_2011; @frenois_2007; @harrison_2009]. 
In addition, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: @yang_2016). 
Mounting evidence also illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part. 
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders [@girgenti_2017; @tovote_2015; @yang_2016], epilepsy [@fabene_2010; @roseti_2013; @suleymanova_2021; @tian_2017], obesity [@guillemotlegris_2017; @kawamura_2021], pain [@mlikparsadaniantz_2015; @old_2012; @paretkar_2019; @yuan_2020], drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; @coller_2012, @freeman_2012, @jacobsen_2016; @wang_2012).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.

Finally, recent studies demonstrated glial mediation in behavior, including in the amygdala [@althammer_2020; @martinfernandez_2017]. 
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors. 

Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit.
