<!-- ####  CXCL12- and CX3CL1-induced regulation of neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication {#example}

Here, I will introduce a simplified model of coordinated actions of neuron-glia interactions fine-tuned by chosen chemokines and gliotransmitters. 

As mentioned above, CX3CL1 is the most widely studied chemokines in relation to neuron–microglia crosstalk and regulation of microglial activity. 
Accumulating evidence illustrates that many environmental triggers can up-regulate CX3CL1 expression, including an insult [@hughes_2002], learning [@sheridan_2014], or the presence of another chemokine, CXCL12, *via* its action on neuronal ADAM17 [@cook_2010] (Fig....).

CX3CL1 was shown to exert neuroprotective actions against  Glu-induced  excitotoxicity, with  mechanisms  fully  dependent  on  A~1~R  [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010] and at least partially dependent on  A~3~R  [@rosito_2012; @rosito_2014].
In contrast, NMDA-induced toxicity, mainly mediated by NR2B-containing extrasynaptic  NMDARs, was reported to require A~2A~R and the presence  of D-serine [@scianni_2013; @lauro_2014].
These results highlight that modulation of glial function by adenosine is essential in the context of neuroprotection, as both microglia and astrocytes release it as a gliotransmitter.

Additionally, it is well-established that astrocytes might also exert a neuroprotective role upon brain insult by buffering extracellular Glu [@blanger_2009]. 
Evidence illustrated that CX3CL1, acting on microglia, induced the production and release of adenosine that exerted their effects on astrocytes by binding to A~1~R (Fig. 3D), and consequently inducing the up-regulation of the astrocytic GLT-1 transporter (Fig. 3E, @catalano_2013).
Microglia can also release CXCL12, which then acts, for example, *via* astrocytic CXCR4 and, in turn, produces TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, leading to remyelination (see Fig...; @bezzi_2001, @cunha_2020).

To sum up, the  mentioned above findings strongly support the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines are key communicating molecules between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserving brain functions.
Please note that this is a simplification of neuron-microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in the context of neuroprotection, and many other factors and connections are omitted for the sake of clarity. -->


<!--### Chemokines modulates behavior {#behavior}

Since mounting evidence supports the notion that chemokines coordinate several brain circuits of behavioral relevance, including hippocampus, DRN, SN, hypothalamus, it may indicate their contribution to these behaviors.
Consistent with this idea, disturbances of several chemokines/chemokine receptor axes were implicated in the pathophysiology of neurobiological disorders [@paolicelli_2014; @poon_2016; @stuart_2015].
Moreover, despite increasing evidence about the chemokine system's role in mediating homeostatic brain functions, the mechanisms underlying chemokines regulation of behavior under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. 
Hence, here I discuss a handful of studies on the regulation of chemokines on various types of behavior, such as learning and memory, social interactions, locomotor activity, anxiety. 
Results from those studies are summarized in Table 3. 

To sum up, these findings reinforce the idea that chemokines and their receptors are involved in higher brain functions regulating many types of behavior, including cognitive, motor, and emotional behavioral effects.
However, to date, very little is known about their cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological profile with regard to potential interaction with glia to put these results in a broader context. // and glial-mediated mechanisms to put these results in a broader context.///

Although many brain regions have been found to participate in anxiety regulation it is commonly accepted that among them the amygdala plays a prominent role (Canteras et al., 2010; Davis and Whalen, 2001; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Engin and Treit, 2008; Everitt et al., 2003; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000, 2007; McNally et al., 2011; Pape and Paré, 2010; Paré et al., 2004; Pérez de la Mora et al., 2008, 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2009).

Several behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, commonly occur in mice with CX3CR1 deletion. -->

All neuronal circuits of higher animals comprise excitatory and inhibitory neurons forming intense feed-forward and feedback connections [@mohler_1990, @ferrante_2009, @roth_2012].
However, the precise control of network operations would not be possible without interneurons.
Although they constitute only 20-30% of all cells in cortical circuits, this small, diverse group of inhibitory neurons enables higher brain functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, or social interaction (for a review: @mederos_2019). 
Through inhibition, GABAergic interneurons can shape the circuit activity controlling (1) frequency of surrounding pyramidal neurons, (2) network excitation level by feed-forward mechanism, and (3) synchronized oscillation events [@mederos_2019]. 
The importance of interneurons in relation to network functioning illustrates the highly controlled manner by which interneurons connect with other neurons [@tremblay_2016]. 

##### Synaptic scaling {#scal}

In order to prevent the destabilizing component of Hebbian plasticity in network function, neurons are able to sense their excitability and trigger negative-feedback homeostatic mechanisms to counteract perturbations in synaptic activity and restrain it within a dynamical but physiological range [@field_2020]. 
Recent accumulating data also highlight the essential role of glial cells, as they are equipped with, for instance, glutamate transporters to control the concentration of glutamate and other neurotransmitters in the microenvironment. 
Importantly, stable but flexible neural activity is fundamental for proper brain function and support of animal behavior, depending on a dynamic interface between homeostatic synaptic  plasticity  mechanisms  and  Hebbian  forms  of plasticity [@field_2020; @tremblay_2016].-->
