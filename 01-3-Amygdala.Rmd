## Amygdala       

The amygdala, a complex comprised of heterogenous collection of nuclei, is located in the medial temporal lobe. 
Its nulei can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: @duvarci_2014).
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this structure, there is no <!--anatomical--> standardization of amygdaloid nuclei terminology. <!-- although there is no standardization in relation to correct term, -->
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes <!--synonym-->the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) [@mcdonald_1998; @sah_2003].
However, here the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, as it was presented in many excellent papers focusing on these domains due to their contribution in fear-conditioning (@bocchio_2016; @duvarci_2014; @ehrlich_2009; @pape_2010; @spampanato_2011, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalanuclei)).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere [@pitknen_1997; @sah_2003]. <!--check citations and more? -->

### Functions

This limbic region is involved in very distinct behaviors related with learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction [@ehrlich_2009; @herry_2010; @ledoux_2000; @roozendaal_2009].<!-- Accumulating evidence indicate that amygdala is involved in. wcześniej: mood regulation, fear-conditioning/associative learning, and modulation of cognitive functions-->
At first glimpse, this variety of functions could be surprising, but most of them are related<!--inne słówko // reduced?--> to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning and its malfunctions. 
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events, so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie -->
This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning. 
For example, during fear conditioning, an neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior [@janak_2015; @ledoux_2000].
Therefore, amygdala has been conserved throughout evolution and even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals [@janak_2015]. 
Amygdala is also an important player in tuning autonomic responses to homeostatic challenges, including those of the peripheral immune system [@pachecolpez_2005]. <!--więcej cytowań / lepiej napisać-->
Recent technological advances and approaches, including optogenetic and pharmacogenetic, in conjunction with genetic targeting of specified cells, battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, enable to determine how neuronal activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes.
Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have<!--inne słówko--> widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @pape_2010; @sah_2003), further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. <!-- figure ? illustrating amygdala as a hub?-->
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the role, anatomy, and physiology of this fascinating and complex brain structure. <!-- brzydkie zdanie napisać jakoś lepiej.... /// This has led to new insights into behavioral functions of amygdala neuronal activity, revealing a complex picture of amygdalar control of behavior. // The fear circuitry orchestrates defense mechanisms in response to environmental threats. This circuitry is evolutionarily crucial for survival, but its dysregulation is thought to play a major role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions in humans.-->

### Structure and Connectivity {#amygdalastructure}
<!-- Anatomy and Physiology?-->
#### The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) {#BLAstructure}

The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter is also known as accessory basal nucleus (@krettek_1978, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalanuclei)). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
It is also often referred as the basolateral nucleus (BLA) and hereafter this term will be used.<!-- In order to avoid misunderstanding, I will refer to the basolateral complex as BLA and basal/basolateral nucleus as B. -->
The BLA is considered to be the main point of the entry for cortical and subcortical sensory inputs into the amygdala (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @lalumiere_2014; @sah_2003a). 
This complex developmentally and structurally is a cortical-like structure [@waclaw_2010]. 
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @mcdonald_1993; @spampanato_2011]. <!-- figure? i może usunąć review i dać jednak ... research?-->

##### Cells

###### Principal cells {#PC}

Principal cells (PC) show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal pyramidal counterparts, including spiny complex dendritic trees and prominent spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections [@faber_2001; @par_1995]. <!-- see figure? -->
BLA principal cells are not homogeneous, but differ mainly in both of those characteristics. <!-- However, no correlation was found between their neuronal firing properties and morphology   -->
However, these variables seem not to be inter-correlated [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000].
Pyramidal-like cells of the BLA are characterized by large triangle-shaped soma, dendritic spines, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite [@mcdonald_1982]. <!-- (McDonald 1982, 1984, 1992). ///mocniej zmienić szczególnie drugą część zdania.../// Previous morphological characterization of BLA principal cells has revealed that these neurons exhibit large, complex dendritic arbors and contain a more prominent apical dendrite similar to that of cortical neurons (McDonald 1982). ///  Our data also show that principal cell dendrite spine density increased at distal regions compared with proximal regions [@klenowski_2015]-->
Based on their morphological profile, BLA neurons display variation in soma volume [@klenowski_2015], <!-- klenowski_2015 // The observed level of somatic variation, dendritic organization, and spine localization is likely to provide important morphological control over the integration of synaptic inputs, which would be expected to influence cellular output and potentially contribute to differences in BLA principal cell physiology. // can be classified including semipyramidal and stellate-like morphology (Rainnie et al. 1993; Sah et al. 2003).-->

Electrophysiologically, the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms an continuum: at one end cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas at the other end cells fire repetitively throughout the current injection with little accommodation [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- może jakiś figure? see Fig. in methods?-->

Interestingly, neurons with prominent spike frequency adaptation were shown to have larger afterhyperpolarization (AHP) than those that fire repetitively [@faber_2002; @sah_1996]. 
As it is well-established that a rich repertoire of ion channels shape the firing pattern of mammalian central neurons (for example: @bean_2007), it is suggested that principal cells have a <!--differential-->distinct distribution of calcium-activated potassium channels responsible for AHP, which leads to difference in their repetitive firing properties [@faber_2001; @faber_2002].
<!-- HERE: additional electrophysiological features of principal cells Additionally, another electrophysiological characteristics of principal neurons in BLA are: relatively wide  action potentials (half-width = 1.2 ms), ....., .....-->
<!-- ALSO more on channels in these neurons // channels and their electrophysiological properties. As electrophysiological properties of neurons are mirrored by their ... of ionic channels -->
Interestingly, some of them display bursting activity or a delay in firing when depolarized from more negative membrane potentials, which is thought to be due to the presence of low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current  [@washburn_1992].
<!-- principal cell apical dendrite structure is organized to support the formation of high levels of distal synaptic inputs, which are likely to be excitatory (Fig. 5). Furthermore, reduced proximal spine density suggests that this region may receive a greater portion of inhibitory inputs compared with distal dendrites. our neurochemical results show a higher number of GABAergic synapses on the soma and proximal dendrites compared with the distal dendrites of principal neurons (Fig. 8), potentially facilitating inhibitory control of principal neuron firing (Miles et al. 1996). @klenowski_2015-->

###### Interneurons {#BLAinter}

Interneurons, in contrast to principal cells, have smaller cell bodies, aspiny dendrites, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the basolateral nuclei [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002; @mcdonald_2004]. <!-- BLA interneurons generally have smaller cell bodies compared with principal cells, lack spines, and have no apparent apical dendrite (McDonald 1982).-->
According to their dendritic trees, they could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, and bipolar cells [@mcdonald_1982]. <!-- After we divided our interneuron data set into spiny and aspiny interneurons on this basis, examination of these subgroups did not reveal any significant morphological differences, nor did we find any obvious localization patterns, as each BLA subnucleus we sampled from contained both spiny and aspiny interneurons (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we found that interneurons classified as spiny had similar proximal and distal spine densities compared with principal cell basal dendrites. This finding is noteworthy, as previous studies have suggested that BLA interneurons are generally spine sparse or aspiny (McDonald 1982; Sah et al. 2003; Washburn and Moises 1992).@klenowski_2015-->
Moreover, analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their expression of the same neurochemical markers. 
Although brain regions may differ in relative ratios of interneuron types, in the BLA, the main two non-overlapping groups are those expressing calbindin (CB+; around 50% of neurons) or calretinin (CR+; around 20% of neurons) [@kemppainen_2000; @mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002]. 
Each of these groups can be further sub-divided based on their expression of somatostatin (SOM+), vasoactive intestinal peptide  (VIP+), cholecystokinin (CCK+), and parvalbumin (PV+) (for a review, see: @spampanato_2011). 

Regarding the electrophysiological profile of BLA interneurons, contrary to principal cells, they show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously *in vivo* at high frequencies (10-15 Hz)  [@spampanato_2011; @pare_1995]. <!-- figure? -->
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons [@petillainterneuronnomenclaturegroup_2008], but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004]. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Specifically, electrophysiological analyses have identified at least six distinct types of firing properties [@jasnow_2009; @mahanty_1998; @sosulina_2010; @woodruff_2007]. <!-- figure ? -->
However, there is no correlation between neurochemical markers and electrophysiological profile. 
For example, four electrophysiologically separable types of cells were found to express PV in combination with either CCK or CB [@sosulina_2010]. 
Although the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity  is currently unclear, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and may modulate local circuits differently. <!-- cytowanie? yup, szczególnie ważne!!!! [@spampanato_2011]-->

<!-- + KANAŁYYYYYYYYYY -->

##### Afferents

As mentioned above, the BLA is regarded as the main input nuclei of the amygdala, receiving strong glutamatergic projections from nearly all sensory modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory and visceral, auditory, and visual), mainly *via* cerebral cortex (for review: @pape_2010; @sah_2003). <!-- może poprawić to zdanie? i chyba nie tylko PC? //  -->
Synapses are made not only on principal neurons<!-- citation?-->, but interneurons in the BLA have also emerged as recipients of cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs [@szinyei_2000]. <!-- zmienić? -->
The majority of connections are ipsilateral, entering the amygdala *via* the external capsule [@mascagni_1993; @sah_2003]. <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review?-->
In all species, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially its medial part, is a major source of cortical projections to the amygdaloid complex [@duvarci_2014; @mcdonald_1996; @pape_2010; @sah_2003], regulating fear extinction and expression [@burgosrobles_2009; @milad_2002; @sotresbayon_2010]. <!-- add that it is important AND BI-DIRECTIONAL -->

Previous studies using anterograde and retrograde tracing have shown that excitatory input from cortical and thalamic regions is received primarily at distal dendritic processes and spines of BLA principal neurons (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999). More recently, there has been a plethora of research demonstrating that these connections play a pivotal role in associative learning tasks such as fear conditioning and extinction (reviewed in Duvarci and Pare 2014; Johansen et al. 2011; Pape and Pare 2010) and the formation of memories that encode incentive value to rewarding stimuli (Everitt et al. 1999; Robbins and Everitt 2002).<!--klenowski_2015-->

<!-- FEAR CONDITIONING-->
A large body of evidence, including fMRI studies in humans [@labar_1998], highlight the involvement of lateral BLA in acquisition of fear conditioning [@blanchard_1972; @ledoux_1990]. <!-- może bardziej it is well known that -->
Principal cells in the LA are described to<!--może jakoś inaczej?--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS and a strong input carrying US information when these experiences are paired. 
This leads to LTP at excitatory synapses onto LA neurons, and in turn, enables CS alone to activate them and induce the freezing behavior [@kim_2017]. 
Consistently, based on optogenetic stimulation of principal cells in the LA, paired with a neutral tone (CS; without a footshock), an increase in freezing behavior both during training and in a later<!--further--> retention test was reported [@johansen_2010]. <!-- DZIWNE ZDANIE ... -->
Similarly, photoactivation of LA axonal terminals from the auditory thalamus (the medial geniculate nucleus, MGN) and the auditory cortex (AC) when applying footshock (without a neutral tone) results in<!-- were shown to produce?--> conditioned freezing and synaptic potentiation [@nabavi_2014]. 
Intriguingly, optical stimulation of a subset of principal neurons expressing Thy1 promoter did not affect freezing behavior during fear conditioning, but rather appeared to influence consolidation specifically for memories that oppose<!--coś z tym słówkiem jest nie tak--> fear conditioning [@jasnow_2013].<!-- Stimulation of these neurons enhanced the retention of the extinction learning [@jasnow_2013].-->

<!-- LEARNING PARAGRAPH - SHORTEN OR DELETE? -->
The notion that BLA neurons contribute to consolidation of learning is further supported by several lines of evidence. 
Firstly, the BLA complex is known to have strong reciprocal connections with structures involved in long-term declarative memory, including the perirhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, and the hippocampus<!-- cytowanie!!!! McDonald pewnie ale brak tego artykułu  [@McDonald2000; cognitive review i brak tego artykułu...-->. 
Moreover, synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA [@bauer_2007; @pelletier_2004]. 
In addition, @huff_2013 highlighted the role of gamma frequency (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, induced in the BLA by bursts of light pulses, in enhancing retention. <!-- końcówka może inaczej?-->
In line with these findings, inhibition of BLA neurons impaired retention of the learning [@huff_2013].

Likewise integrating CS and aversive stimuli by BLA neurons, CS can be paired with rewarding stimuli, such as sweet liquid or food pellets [@schoenbaum_1998; @tye_2007; @tye_2008].
Consistent with this notion, it is well-established that both fear- and reward-induced conditioning responses <!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues--> are associated with a synaptic potentiation in the LA, resulting in excitatory drive in LA neurons following the cue and thereby mediating cue-triggered behavior [@clem_2010; @johansen_2010; @tye_2008]. <!-- nowsze cytowania i poprawić to zdanie... -->
Hence, learning about potential rewards is adaptive, as is learning about environmental stimuli that predict danger, and both engage the amygdala [@janak_2015]. <!--poprawić.. Thus, not only fear conditioning, but also reward cue responses develop through long-lasting enhancement of glutamatergic inputs from sensory thalamic stimuli onto LA principal cells in the LA 78. ///  -> Hence, amygdala seems to be involved in learning a spectrum of of positive (rewarding) to negative (aversive) outcomes-->

<!--NEUROMODULATORS-->
While the balance of glutamate and GABA transmission within the BLA orchestrates learning, anxiety states and addition, these two neurotransmitter systems are tightly regulated by numerous neuromodulators, such as <!-- wymienić --> that fine-tune these behavioral outputs. <!-- nie wiem czy to nie bardziej zdanie na podsumowanie, a tutaj coś innego jak : it should be noted that amygdala is also strongly innervated by different types of neuromodulators, such as dopamine, serotonine, ..., and will be discussed in details in next section --> 
For example, dopamine, released by axons originated from the midbrain neurons [@asan_1997], plays crucial role in modulating BLA activity.
<!-- chu 2012 jednak później na razie ... -->

Another neuromodulator, serotonin (5-HT), has been suggested to have a fast excitatory inputs in the BLA (264). <!-- zmienić drugą część zdania i sprawdzić tę cytację z sah 2003 -->
However, since this initial report, subsequent experiments have been unable to reproduce these results as all inputs to these neurons can be blocked with a combination of glutamatergic and GABAergic antagonists (136, 259, 290). <!-- zmienić -->
Instead, 5-HT3 receptors in this nucleus have been proposed to be present presynaptically on interneuron terminals (103, 104). <!-- sah 2003 zmienić-->


By combining optogenetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, it was suggested that 5-HT neurons exert a frequency-dependent, cell-type-specific control over BA circuitry *via* 5-HT and glutamate co-release to inhibit the BA output. <!-- zmienić to od 5-HT neurons... Sengupta 2017 i rozbudować...
Optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals at low frequencies ( < 1 Hz) evoked a short-latency excitation of BA interneurons (INs) that was depressed at higher frequencies. 
Pharmacological analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by glutamate and not 5-HT because it was abolished by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. 
Optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals at higher frequencies (10–20 Hz) evoked both slow excitation and slow inhibition of INs. 
These effects were mediated by 5-HT because they were blocked by antagonists of 5-HT~2A~ and 5-HT~1A~ receptors, respectively.
These fast glutamate-and slow 5-HT-mediated responses often coexisted in the same neuron. 
Interestingly, fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking INs displayed differential modulation by glutamate and 5-HT.
Furthermore, optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals did not evoke glutamate release onto BA principal neurons, but inhibited these cells directly *via* activation of 5-HT~1A~ receptors and indirectly *via* enhanced GABA release. 
--> 
The integration of sensory inputs and subsequent generation of emotional responses is largely determined by the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory input to BLA principal cells (Davis et al. 1994), in addition to local inhibition provided by GABAergic interneurons (Ehrlich et al. 2009; Spampanato et al. 2011). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the pattern of local innervation within the BLA promotes synchronous firing of principal cells that facilitates rapid oscillations and synaptic plasticity (Muller et al. 2006).<!--klenowski 2016-->

##### Intrinsic connectivity

Principal cells prefer to form local synapses with proximal interneurons and send longer distance collaterals onto other principal cells [@szinyei_2000].<!-- cytowanie tylko do interneuronów czy ogólnie? sprawdzić-->
This glutamatergic inputs to BLA interneurons have an unusual property<!--lepiej napisać-->: synapses containing AMPA receptors with low GluR2 subunit in the postsynaptic membrane and no NMDA receptors [@mahanty_1998]. <!-- zmienić bardziej...  i rozbudować o coś takiego ale z nowszymi cytowaniami i lepiej napisane 
Generally, including principal BLA or interneurons from other brain areas, their glutamatergic input contain both NMDA- and AMPA- receptors.
Moreover, AMPA receptor are heterodimers with four possible subunits: mGluR1-4. 
It was documented that AMPA receptors with few or no mGluR2 component results in strong inward rectification and calcium permeability [@washburn_1997].  -->
On the other hand, long-distance collaterals are seems to be sent with preferential lateromedial directionality, i.e., LA principal neurons send many projections onto neurons in the basal nuclei (B) [@duvarci_2014; @krettek_1978; @pitkanen_1997]. <!-- poprawić zdanie i fig ??? -->

Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).

BLA interneurons form synaptic connections with each other, creating local circuit networks [@lang_1998]. <!-- poprawić i nowsze cytowanie?-->
Consistent with this idea, morphological analyses have shown that axons from those cells branch several times creating many axon collaterals and terminals near the cell body [@millhouse_1983]. <!-- znów strasznie stare cytowanie... -->
Activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA~A~-receptor-dependent and slow, GABA~B~-receptor-dependent components. <!-- sah 2003 citations 108, 135, 218, 284). zmienić bardziej-->
Electrophysiological analysis of spontaneously occurring miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSC)<!--from where? --> have revealed that distinct subpopulations of interneurons are responsible for these two types of inhibitory components. <!-- poprawić? that ...  different interneurons in the BLA are responsible for generating the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor-mediated component of inhibitory synaptic current (263). zmienić -->
In contrast to most other cells, the slow component of the inhibitory synaptic potential in LA pyramidal neurons is in part generated by a calcium-activated potassium conductance that is activated by calcium influx *via* NMDA receptors (39, 108)<!-- zmienić --> , suggesting NMDAR coupling to calcium-activated potassium channels, at least in the lateral amygdala. <!-- This observation raises the possibility that NMDA receptors in lateral amygdala neurons might be coupled to calcium-activated potassium channels.-->
Alternatively, axon collaterals of PC send their inputs to interneurons, indicating a feedback role for interneurons<!-- MOCNO ZMIENIĆ  I NIE ROZUMIEM  ///  However, it is possible that the excitatory inputs to interneurons are due to activation of axon collaterals of pyramidal cells, which indicates a feedback role for interneurons. -->
In line with this hypothesis, immunological studies illustrate that while parvalbumin interneurons receive local excitatory (262) and thalamic inputs (295), only few synapses of cortical origin have been found on those cells (262). <!--The PV+ interneurons receive strong excitatory inputs from local BLA principal cells but weak inputs from the cerebral cortex [@smith_2000] suggesting a main role in feedback inhibition. /// <- moje zdanie /// Tracking studies in the cat and monkey found that cortical afferents form few if any synapses with parvalbumin positive neurons, while local afferents do make synapses onto them (262). -->
These findings illustrate the notion that different populations of interneurons can have a feed-forward and/or a feedback role in the BLA. <!-- zmienić jeszcze mocniej //// These findings are consistent with the proposal that different populations of interneurons can have a feed-forward and/or a feedback role in the basolateral complex. gdzie ten proposal? -->

On the other hand, large inhibitory synaptic events underlie spontaneous and cortically-evoked membrane potential fluctuations of BLA pyramidal-like cells [@lang_1997; @popescu_2011]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
Since BLA interneurons fire robustly during oscillatory activity, inhibition of principal cells may also originate from feed-forward action of local GABAergic neurons [@lang_1998]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
An interesting recent study sheds light on this issue showing that CB+ interneurons mediate cortically-evoked feed-forward inhibition in the BLA [@unal_2014]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
Selective feed-forward and feed-back inhibition onto principal cells has been suggested to be mediated by different types of PV+ interneurons of BLA [@woodruff_2007]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
It is clear from both functional and anatomical data that PV expressing cells powerfully inhibit both principal cells as well as other interneurons [@muller_2005; @woodruff_2007]. <!--  zmienić--> 

A recent study demonstrates an interesting target-specific effect induced by dopamine acting at PV expressing- principal cells or PV-expressing-interneuron synapses [@chu_2012]. <!-- zmienić -->
Specifically, dopamine selectively inhibits the release of GABA from PV+ interneurons to principal cells, but not to other interneurons. <!-- zmienić Specifically, @chu_2012 demonstrated that activation of D2 receptor in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in LA reduced GABAergic transmission only to principal cells, but not to interneurons. --> 
This target-specific neurochemical modulation enables a sharp disinhibition of principal cells not accompanied by a concomitant alteration of the inhibitory inputs. <!-- zmienić -->
Such a decrease of the inhibitory tone on BLA principal cells by dopamine may facilitate the induction of long- term potentiation at sensory afferents [@bissire_2003]<!--Bissieere2003-->and the formation of fear memories [@fadok_2009]. <!-- zmienić -->

BLA principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with proximal dendrites having fewer spines but higher densities of neurochemical GABAergic synapses compared with distal dendrites. Furthermore, we found that BLA interneurons exhibited reduced dendritic arbor lengths and spine densities but had significantly higher densities of putative GABAergic synapses compared with principal cells, which was correlated with an increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. [@klenowski_2015]

These cells (interneurons) receive cortical inputs that are regionally similar to principal cells (Smith et al. 2000); however, their efferent connections appear to be distributed   extensively within the local BLA network (Carlsen 1988; Ehrlich et al. 2009; McDonald et al. 2002; Rainnie et al. 1991).

Previous studies have shown that a large amount of BLA inhibitory activity is provided by locally projecting interneurons (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2006; Rainnie et al. 2006; Woodruff and Sah 2007), and electron microscopic analysis has revealed that BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct patterns of axonal innervation (McDonald and Betette 2001; Muller et al. 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007). These analyses showed that BLA interneurons expressing calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV), which constitute ~ 50% of the cell population (McDonald and Mascagni 2001; Rainnie et al. 2006), formed axonal arborizations that target the soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment of principal cells (McDonald and Betette 2001; Muller et al. 2005, 2006). Dense interconnections are also formed between somas and axon terminals of PV-containing interneurons (Muller et al. 2005). Regional differences in the connectivity of interneuron subtypes are also observed for somatostatin-containing interneurons, which predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of principal cells (Muller et al. 2007). More recently, an elegant study performed by Bienvenu and colleagues identified two additional interneuron subtypes, axo-axonic and amygdalostriatal. Axo-axonic cells primarily innervated the initial axon segment of principal cells, while amygdalo-striatal cells formed perisomatic innervation of principal neurons and also medium spiny neurons in the amygdala-striatum border (Bienvenu et al. 2012). 

Our Sholl analysis revealed an increased number of neurochemical GABAergic synapses at the soma and proximal dendrites of principal cells, which was reduced on dendrites with increased radial distance away from the soma (Fig. 8). Coupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. This arrangement was also observed for BLA interneurons; however, densities of neurochemical GABAergic synapses at this cell type were significantly increased compared with principal cells (Fig. 7). Given that inhibitory input to BLA cells (McDonald et al. 2011) and locally projecting interneurons predominantly innervates perisomatic targets and subtypes shown to selectively target dendrites at distal regions (CB and somatostatin expressing) primarily interact with principal cells (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2007), the high density of neurochemical GABAergic synapses formed at distal dendrites of BLA interneurons may arise from non-local inhibitory input; however, the source of this input remains to be determined.

While it is conceivable that a proportion of the neurochemical GABAergic synapses we quantified arose via connections between neurons in and outside the BLA (presumably those formed at distal dendrites), we believe that the cellular organization observed within this region suggests that the majority are formed by BLA interneuron-BLA interneuron and BLA interneuron-BLA principal cell contacts. Hence, our data suggest that BLA interneurons not only provide strong regulation of principal cell output by targeting the soma and proximal dendrites but also form a densely interconnected inhibitory network consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron GABAergic contacts. This level of somatodendritic organization, coupled with reciprocal excitatory connections provided by principal cells (McDonald et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2000), which can fire synchronously (Pare et al. 1995; Pare and Gaudreau 1996), may facilitate the propagation of inhibitory signals within the BLA. Furthermore, the subsequent inhibitory feedback onto principal cells is thought to contribute to rhythmic cell firing and synchronization of BLA activity (Pare et al. 2002). This was recently demonstrated for rhythmic compound IPSCs of PV interneurons, which improved spike-timing precision and synchronized principal cell firing in the BLA (Ryan et al. 2012).

The results from this study indicate that the different regions do, in fact, make different subcellular connections. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The BLA appears to make synaptic connections much closer to the soma, relative to other regions, especially the thalamic inputs. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Additionally, the BLA inputs target spines of an “intermediate” size, along with ventral hippocampal inputs, in contrast to the thalamic inputs to the large spines and the contralateral mPFC inputs to the small spines. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
As both the size of the spine and the distance from the soma govern the relative strengths of the inputs, these findings shed light on how different regions influence local circuit activity in other regions. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In a follow-up study, Little and Carter (2013) extended their findings, again using optogenetics combined with two-photon microscopy. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In this case, their findings indicated that BLA inputs to the mPFC were considerably stronger on mPFC neurons that innervated the BLA, compared to mPFC neurons that provide inputs to the contralateral mPFC. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Together, these findings have contributed to a deeper understanding for how the BLA and mPFC inter-act and, critically, provide a foundation for understanding how BLA inputs to the mPFC may regulate PFC activity and PFC- dependent functions.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

BLA projects to the ventral hippocampus, structure which is also involved in anxiety (Pitkänen et al., 1995, 2000; Bannerman et al., 2003). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Felix-Ortiz et al. found that inhibition of BLA afferents to the ventral hippocampus, via activation of halorhodopsin, decreased anxiety-related behaviors. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Similarly, stimulation of such afferents, using 20 Hz light pulses to activate ChR2, increased anxiety-related behaviors. 
Moreover, electrophysiology analysis suggested that the effects of stimulating BLA inputs to the ventral hippocampus were mediated through local circuit mechanisms involving both direct activation of principal cells in the hippocampus and indirect recruitment of inhibitory neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In other work, Felix-Ortiz and Tye (2014) examined optical stimulation and inhibition of the BLA axon terminals in the ventral hippocampus during tests of social behavior. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In a resident-juvenile-intruder test, stimulation of these terminals, using 20 Hz light pulses, reduced social interactions of the resident, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased such interactions, suggesting that activation of this pathway increased anxiety in the animals whereas silencing of this pathway produced the opposite effect. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The effects with stimulation were blocked with microinjections of glutamate receptor antagonists into the ventral hippocampus, indicating that the results were due to stimulation of BLA axon terminals and the concomitant release of glutamate from those terminals. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Prior work has noted the existence of neurons within the basal nucleus of the BLA that are responsive to cues associated with footshocks and other neurons that are responsive to cues previously associated with footshocks that have been extinguished. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Senn et al. (2014) investigated whether such neurons also show distinct projection patterns to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
To perform a functional investigation of these subpopulations of neurons, retrogradely transported viruses containing Cre-recombinase were injected into either the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortex while a conditional viral vector expressing the opsins in a Cre-dependent manner was injected into the BLA. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
As a result, the opsins were selectively expressed in the IL-projecting neurons or the PL- projecting neurons, enabling illumination of the entire BLA to only stimulate or inhibit the specific subpopulation of neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Consistent with previous work suggesting a dichotomy between the dorsal regions of the mPFC (PL) and the ventral regions (IL) with regard to fear conditioning (Peters et al., 2009), the authors demonstrated that BLA neurons projecting to the PL are activated by unextinguished cues whereas those projecting to the IL are activated by extinguished cues. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Moreover, inhibition of IL-projecting neurons during cue extinction training produced a significant impairment in the retention of the extinction learning, compared to stimulating such neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Conversely, inhibition of the PL-projecting neurons during such training enhanced the retention of the extinction learning, compared to stimulating such neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
While much previous research has focused on the mPFC inputs to the BLA in regulating fear extinction and expression, these findings provide evidence that BLA inputs to distinct mPFC regions also differentially influence such behaviors.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Moreover, some set of projections are sent from both BLA and CeA. This connections are sent to BNST (Dong et al., 2001) and various hypothalamic nuclei (Pitkanen, 2000). <!-- zmienić @duvarci2014 -->
Finally, the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups (releasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline [NA], and dopamine [DA]) of the basal forebrain and brainstem (Steriade and Pare, 2007).<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

As part of understanding the precise role played by the BLA in such behaviors, Stuber et al. (2011) examined the pathway from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NA) core in modulating and driving reinforcement of operant behavior. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Although previous evidence had suggested that the BLA could directly influence dopamine release in the NA (Howland et al., 2002), a key mechanism for reinforcement, it was not clear whether activity in the BLA inputs to the NAcore could actually reinforce operant behavior or was necessary for reward seeking. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Stuber et al. found that mice engaged in an operant behavior (nose pokes) in order to receive optical stimulation (burst of 20 Hz light pulses) of the BLA axon terminals in the NAcore. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Similarly, optical inhibition, via activation of halorhodopsin, of the BLA terminals decreased responding for a sucrose reward. Strikingly, optical stimulation of mPFC inputs to the NAcore did not produce the same effects.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Other work has shown that optical stimulation of BLA inputs to the NAshell are also reinforcing (Britt et al., 2012), though, in contrast to the mPFC inputs to the NAcore, stimulation of mPFC inputs or ventral hippocampal inputs to the NAshell was also found to be reinforcing.  <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Together, these findings illustrate not only the increasing evidence for a role for BLA glutamatergic inputs to the NA in regulating reinforcement and reward but also that, depending on the part of the NA targeted, other glutamatergic inputs do not necessarily produce identical results <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

BLA is a key part of the neural circuit that drives drug-seeking behavior triggered by drug-associated cues (See et al., 2003). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
However, as the BLA projects to both the PL and the NA core, both of which are considered critical components of a general drug-seeking circuit (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001; McFarland et al., 2004; LaLumiere and Kalivas, 2008), it has not been clear which pathway is responsible for driving cue-induced drug-seeking.  <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Recent work by Stefanik and Kalivas (2013) has used optogenetics to investigate this issue. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The BLA was transduced with ArchT. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Inhibition of BLA terminals in either the PL or NAcore reduced cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking, indicating that activity in both pathways is obligatory for associative cue-driven cocaine-seeking. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Of note, there are other pathways that originate in the BLA that have since been implicated in bidirectional regulation of anxiety. <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->
Optically driving BLA projections to the ventral HPC (vHPC) is anxiogenic61 , whereas photostimulation of BLA inputs in the anterodorsal BNST (adBNST) is anxiolytic62. <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->
Photostimulation of the BLA–Vhpc pathway also decreases social interaction63, an effect perhaps related to the increase in anxiety that is seen following BLA–vHPC activation64 <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->

However, importantly, principal cells in the BLA innervate the CeA, either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses on CeA neurons (@krettek_1978, @lopezdearmentia_2004, see Section \@ref(CeA)) or indirectly *via* GABAergic ITC~m~ neurons<!--explain-->, leading to feed-forward inhibition [@jngling_2008, @royer_1999].<!-- poprawić to zdanie -->

Glutamatergic synapses are formed at the distal dendritic processes and spines of BLA principal neurons (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999; LeDoux et al. 1991; Mascagni et al. 1993), which then send projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (Tye et al. 2011), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Weller and Smith 1982), nucleus accumbens (Stuber et al. 2011), and medial prefrontal cortex (Senn et al. 2014) to facilitate the coordination of emotional responses. 

#### Intercalated masses {#ITCs}

Intercalated neurons (ITCs) do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the amygdala. <!-- figure -->
In particular, these fiber bundles are the external capsule bordering on the lateral part of the BLA and the intermediate capsule separating the BLA from the CeA. <!-- figure-->
Clusters located in the external and intermediate capsules are called lateral (ITC~L~) and medial (ITC~M~), respectively. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
ITCs are GABAergic cells with small (10–15 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) ovoid cell bodies [@mcdonald_1993; @nitecka_1987]. 
Their dendritic trees are spiny, flattened, long, and mostly remains within border of<!--constrainted within?--> the fiber bundle where their soma is located [@millhouse_1986]. 
Regarding their electrophysiological features, ITCs have higher membrane resistance and firing frequency compared with BLA and CeA interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @royer_2000]. 
Their high intrinsic firing frequency could be explained by their expression of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) after action potential, which is explained by slowly-inactivating K+ currents (I~SD~) [@royer_2000]. <!-- zmienić -->
Additionally, these neurons are surrounded by a small subset of larger (>50 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) cells with long thick dendrites. 
Still, little is known about these neurons within ITC masses. 
Previously, they were regarded as cholinergic neurons [@nitecka_1989]; however a recent report demonstrated their GABAergic nature and strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (mGluR1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`), GABA~A~ receptors `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`1 subunit, and parvalbumin (PV) [@bienvenu_2015].

##### Afferents

ITCs express the highest density of `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala [@jacobsen_2006; @palomarescastillo_2012; @pape_2010]<!--[@marowsky_2005]-->, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems. 

These cells receive sensory input as well, participating in fear conditioning [].<!--Citation and better written????!!!Thus, multiple plastic systems, and especially those integrating GABAergic neurons, could act in concert to encode aspects of stimulus associations in the amygdala.-->


##### Intrinsic connectivity 

Additionally, intercalated neurons form GABAergic reciprocal synapses onto other intercalated cell <!--[@Geracitano2012; @Royer2000]dodać cytowania--> within each cluster as well as between clusters, at least dorsal and ventral medial clusters []. <!-- inaczej to napisać i znaleźć cytowanie/// within each ITC cluster,  -->


##### Efferents 

As intercalated cells inhibit neurons in the CeA, thereby their activity will have an impact on the output of this structure. <!-- może lepiej napisać -->
<!--Little is known about the intercalated cell cluster in the external capsule. It was documented that these cells form synapses with BLA neurons and does not project to CeA [@marowsky_2005]. POPRAWIĆ i może wiadomo już coś więcej? It is tempting to speculate that similar to their medial counterparts, these intercalated neurons modulate cortical inputs to the BLA. 
Similar to BLA connections pattern, neurons in ITC cluster located dorsolaterally (ICMMD) send more projections to the CeM than CeL, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in dorsally located ITC mass  <!-- [@Royer1999; @Pare1993] DODAĆ PÓŹNIEJ CYTOWANIA-->


In addition to common GABA~A~ receptor, GABA~C-like~ receptor, insensitive to bicuculine, has been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses between ITCs and CeL neurons. <!-- moje zdanie-->
<!-- These receptors have been called GABA~C-like~ receptors due to their pharmacological similarity to retinal GABA~C~ receptors (89, 217). zmienić, cytowanie sah2003--><!-- Bicuculline-insensitive receptors have also been shown to be present in the medial subdivision (239), indicating these receptors are present throughout the central nucleus. Although bicuculline-insensitive ionotropic GABA receptors have been described in other regions of the central nervous system (90), the presence of these receptors at synapses has not been shown outside the central amygdala. zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->
The two GABA receptor types appear to be localized to different GABAergic inputs onto CeL neurons.
Thus inputs from the intercalated neurons that form synapses onto the dendrites of CeL neurons express both GABAA- and GABAC-like receptors. <!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->
These results suggest that the different GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of the central amygdala (47).<!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003--><!-- trochę nie ogarniam czy w końcu jest rozróżnienie czy nie na te dwa podtypy receptorów w różnych komórkach?!?!?!?! -->



#### Central amygdala {#CeAstructure}

Central amygdala (CeA), mainly a GABAergic nucleus, is comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM) and intermediate (CeI) divisions [@jolkkonen_1998; @mcdonald_1982a; @sah_2003]; however, the classification of these regions is inconsistent. <!-- inne cytowanie? problem z nim bo takiego nie ma  [@Cassell1986].-->
Importantly, the capsular region of the CeA appears to overlap with intercalated cell clusters [@mcdonald_1982a; @pape_2010] and will be hereafter referred to as ITCs.
However, CeA is commonly divided into the CeL and CeM divisions and there is a sparse number of investigations regarding CeI and CeL as a functionally and anatomically distinct subdivisions [@ciocchi_2010; @duvarci_2014; @haubensak_2010]. <!-- zobaczyć co z tym CeI bo nie rozumiem .... Therefore, in this dissertation, the latter classification will be used. odwołanie się do figury!!!!-->
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), is also considered to be a part of extended amygdala due to their similar phenotypes of neurons and intra-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense inter-connectivity [@fox_2015; @sah_2003]. 
However, BNST is out of the scope of this dissertation and will not be discussed here. 

Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered as a main output nuclei [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016].
Neurons within this nucleus are GABAergic with different functional and molecular features.  <!-- figure i poprawić to zdanie...  (-->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons [@mcdonald_1993; @sun_1993],
This is consistent with different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA [@medina_2004; @waclaw_2010]. 
Precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neurons-like morphology, displaying relatively small soma and multiple primary dendrites rich in branches and spines. <!--with numerous branches with high density of-->
On the other hand, CeM neurons have a large soma, dendrites with few branches with low density of dendritic spines [@cassell_1989; @mcdonald_1982a]. <!--[@Marina1999; @Hall1972-->

Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF) and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), constituting more than 90% of all neurons in CeA.

<!-- description of Late Firing neurons--><!-- exhibiting a substantial delay to action potential (AP) initiation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. -->
LF neurons display a pronounced delay before onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. <!-- figure? -->
It is thought that this characteristic delay<!--synonym--> is mediated by K~v1~-dependent slowly inactivated D-type K^+^ currents [@hou_2016; @martina_1999].

<!-- description of Regular Spiking neurons -->
generating repetitive firing spikes [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004].

The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of whole CeA neuronal population and are: (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells [@marina_1999]. <!-- figure-->
Fast-spiking cells shows a high membrane resistance and a high action potential frequency (>40 Hz), showing no accommodation, analogous to a subtype of interneurons present in the cortex, the hippocampus or the BLA,  discussed in previous section. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with > 1 ms in other cell types in CeA. <!-- citations? -->
They have also higher frequency of spontaneous synaptic potentials (sEPSPs). <!-- citations? -->
<!--  CeA neurons display aspiny morphology. which one? citations? -->
<!--These neurons likely correspond to local-circuit cells.  which one? -->
<!-- neuromarkers and morphology? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Low-threshold bursting cells are endowed with T-type calcium channels, giving rise to spike bursts. <!-- citations? -->
One of their characteristics is the presence of rebound spikes after hyperpolarizing current step [@dumont_2002; @hou_2016]. <!-- fig -->
<!-- neuromarkers? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Like neurons in striatum, neuronal cells in CeA also express wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including protein kinase C`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` (PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`), somatostatin (SOM), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin and others [@cassell_1989; @haubensak_2010].
Of these, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` and SOM are the two most highly expressed and largely non-overlapping neurochemical markers [@haubensak_2010; @hunt_2017; @li_2013].

Considering the expression of immunohistochemical markers, together with their electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections, two groups of CeA neurons have emerged: those expressing protein kinase C `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+) or somatostatin (SOM+). <!-- -->
<!--Of note, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` marker is specific to CeA. -->
PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+ neurons form relatively homogeneous group, which is comprised mainly of late-firing cells (~85%).<!-- and these neurons are predominantly described as late-firing (LF) neurons -->
These neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> following a fear conditioning protocol and thus are often referred as CeL~off~ cells. <!-- Following fear conditioning, these neurons respond to the CS with a reduction in activity and have therefore been called Ce- LOFF cells (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010). -->

In contrary, most of the PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells are SOM+.
However, those cells are classified as both late-firing (40%) or regular-spiking types (60%). <!-- może jakoś inaczej napisać -->
Moreover, these neurons respond to the fear conditioning with an increase in activity, and have, therefore, been termed CeL~ON~ neurons [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013]. 
Hence, it is plausible that these distinct populations fulfill different functional roles. <!-- We suggest that PKC␦-expressing and SOM- expressing neurons form heterogeneous populations of neurons, with different populations contributing to different behavioral outcomes. Understanding the flow of information through the CeA and its outputs, in a behaviorally specific and relevant manner, will be a challenge for future experiments. Hunt 2017-->

<!--tu skończyłam-->
substantial unidirectional connections between the CeL and the CeM (McDonald, 1982; Grove, 1988; Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998). 
Neurons in both regions also make extensive local connections (McDonald, 1982; Sun and Cassell, 1993; Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998), with local glutamate excitation of CeL neurons evoking IPSCs in neighboring neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004). 
A second population of CeL neurons, which is largely separate from the PKC(⫹) population, expresses somatostatin [somatostatin-positive (SOM⫹); Li et al., 2013]. 
These neurons receive direct synaptic input from the lateral amygdala, which is potentiated following auditory fear conditioning (Li et al., 2013). 
Electrophysiologically, PKC␦(⫺) neurons which are predominantly SOM(⫹), have been described as either LF or regular spiking (RS). 
Following fear conditioning, PKC␦(⫺) neurons respond to the CS with an increase in activity, and have therefore been called CeLON neurons (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010), which likely also correspond to SOM(⫹) neurons (Yu et al., 2016). 
PKC␦(⫺) neurons inhibit PKC(⫹) neurons, which in turn project to the CeM (Haubensak et al., 2010).- Hunt2017

##### Afferents

<!--CeL neurons receive oxytonergic innervation from hypothalamus and -->
Importantly, despite being regarded as the main output nuclei, CeA also receives substantial inputs. 
Specifically, hypothalamic axon terminals release oxytocin onto CeL neurons, which results in their increased excitability [@knobloch_2012]. 
Moreover,  when these terminals are stimulated during fear conditioning, it leads to attenuation of freezing behavior [@knobloch_2012]. <!-- poprawić -->
Stimulation of axons from another CeL input, parabrachial nucleus, leads to suppression of appetite [@Carter2013], which suggests that CeL has many parallel circuits. <!--CeA receives projections from BNST [@Gungor2015]-->
<!-- This picture is more complex when added a role of neuromodulators. 
Neurons in CeL and CeM express many neuropeptides (Gray and Magnuson 1987, 1992; Woodhams et al. 1983) that likely modulate fast inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission (Kash et al. 2015; McElligott and Winder 2009).  zmienić -->
In addition to excitatory, oxygenic and dopaminergic innervations, nuclei in amygdala are also strongly modulated by acetylocholine [@washburn_1992], norepinephire  [@faber_2002]<!--sprawdzić czy na pewno dobra cytacja-->, serotonin, and opioids <!-- more citations and figure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-->. 
<!-- division by BLA and CeA?!--->

 

Thus, each nuclei receives unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
These findings contribute to our better understanding of functional and behavioral significance of those diverse sets of inputs to the amygdala.<!-- better written .... how specific inputs, and even genetically distinct inputs, to the amygdala regulate both behavior and local circuit activity --> 

##### Intrinsic connectivity 

The LA was shown to form functional excitatory synapses on SOM+ and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells in the CeL (CeL:SOM+), and the excitatory strength of these synapses greatly increased as a result of fear conditioning (Li 2013). <!-- chyba wcześniej  i zmienić -->

The CeA network then receives signals from the BLA and computes the inhibitory GABAergic output to various brain areas. <!-- zmienić -->
Specifically, 
Within CeA, neurons form GABAergic synapses with each other. 
Recent study using optogenetic approach with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings nicely showed that neurons in the CeL are extensively interconnected, with local connections apparent between all types of neurons, but strongest between like neurons (SOM+ `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`SOM+ and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+) `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")` PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+))[@hunt_2017]. <!-- ZMIENIĆ JESZCZE BARDZIEJ -->
Moreover, by combining tracing, optogenetic, and electrophysiological techniques, it was demonstrated that both types of CeL neurons mainly unidirectionally project to CeM [@Petrovich1997; @Jolkkonen1998; @Haubensak2010; @Li2013; @Cocchi2010]. <!-- lepiej napisać i cytowania ... -->




Although both subtypes of CeL neurons inhibit one another and both project to the CeM52,53 , CeLON neurons respond to a fear CS at a shorter latency than CeLOFF52, suggesting that conditioned fear responses occur following activation of CeLON neurons that inhibit CeLOFF neurons projecting to CeM output neurons53 , thereby promoting freezing through disinhibition52,53. 

More recently, it was found that distinct subtypes of CeL neurons contact CeM cells projecting to different brainstem sites. 
In particular, CeM cells that project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are contacted by CeL neurons expressing oxytocin receptors (OR+), whereas CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) receive inputs from OR- CeL neurons (Viviani et al., 2011). 
It should be noted that many of the OR+ CeL neurons also express PKC<!--delta--> but not SOM and conversely for OR- CeL neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013).

The presence of experience-dependent potentiation in the CeL indicates that this region is also important for acquisition of the CS–US association, as suggested by earlier studies17,40,52, rather than merely serving as a relay of information from the LA

In mice, reducing the activity of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons was found to block decreased feeding stimulated by sickness or unpalatable tastes 58. 
Conversely, optogenetic excitation of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice, and this was not a confound of reduced activity or increased anxiety. 
These results indicate that CeL:PKCδ+ neurons suppress feeding in response to anorexigenic stimuli58. 
multiple inputs to CeL:PKCδ+ neurons that are activated by anorexigenic signals, including the BLA, the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the insula (IN)58


neurons in both the CeM and CeL receive glutamatergic inputs from the lateral and basal nucleus which activate both AMPA and NMDA receptors [(Royer and M de A 2004)]]. <!-- zmienić -->
Excitatory inputs to CeL neurons also express presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (186). <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
As in many other regions of the central nervous system  (132, 207), activation of these receptors leads to depression of the synaptic input. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
The activity of these receptors is modulated following kindling and chronic cocaine treatment 186 . <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
These findings suggest that alterations in synaptic efficacy at inputs to the CeA may be involved in the changes seen in epilepsy and behavioral sensitization to cocaine. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->

By making reciprocal inhibitory connections, these neurons provide both feedforward and/or feedback inhibition within the CeL (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ).

Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses. Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression. Such cell-type-specific transmission, modulation, and connectivity are likely to be critical for amygdala network function. [@hou_2016].

##### Efferents 

<!-- to add -->
In particular, whereas LA exclusively projects to CeL, the BA nuclei additionally make synapses onto CeM neurons [@krettek_1978]. <!-- poprawić jakoś -->
Moreover, neurons in the LA preferentially make synapses onto ITC cluster located dorsally (ITC~DM~), whereas ventral medial cluster (ITC~VM~) receives input from BL and BM principal cells [@royer_2000]. <!-- poprawić i figure ... -->
The study conducted by @tye_2011 nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals <!-- or cell body --> in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased this behavioral phenotype. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feed-forward inhibition of the CeM [@ciocchi_2010; @tye_2011] <!-- poprawić i brak tego cytowania @Pare2004;// BLA-cell-body activation decreased time spent by mice in the open arms of an elevated plus maze (EPM), indicating an increase in anxiety-like behaviour --> 

Thus, a glutamatergic BLA projection to the CeA can promote anxiolytic behavior. <!-- poprawić -->

when ChR2 was selectively expressed in CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons to allow their direct photoactivation, increased time in the open arms of the EPM was observed 58. <!-- cai 2014  from janak_2015-->
These data support the notion that a population of BLA neurons preferentially excites CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons that lead to reduced anxiety, perhaps through the projection from CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ to CeM output neurons. <!-- nie ogarniam ... -->
Alternatively, the CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neuronal projection to the BNST, also implicated in anxiety [@kim_2013], could mediate anxiolysis. <!-- zmienić -->
These studies show that the BLA–CeA pathway does not universally promote aversive states. <!-- zmienić -->



 
#### Amygdala projections
<!-- chaos -->
In addition to complex patterns of inputs<!--?-->, amygdala has also widespread efferent projections, including both cortical and subcortical regions (208). <!-- cytowanei? // On the output side, the targets of the amygdala are extremely diverse, however the CeM is widely accepted to be the main output nuclei.--> 

Although many cortical regions are contacted by BLA axons, this review will only consider the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), because it plays a critical role in regulating conditioned fear (Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010).  <!-- sprawdzić -->

Other amygdala outputs thought to contribute to conditioned fear include projections to BNST (Dong et al., 2001) and various hypothalamic nuclei (Pitkanen, 2000). <!-- CEA provides an important GABAergic input to the BNST, one that has been implicated as a critical pathway in the central stress system (Jasnow et al., 2004; Walker and Davis, 2008).-->

Finally, the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups (releasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline [NA], and dopamine [DA]) of the basal forebrain and brainstem (Steriade and Pare, 2007).


Indeed, nearly all brainstem projections of the amygdala are sent from CeM (Hopkins and Holstege 1978; Petrovich and Swanson 1997; Veening et al. 1984). <!-- Indeed, CeA supplies most amygdala projections to the brainstem nuclei that generate the behavioral and visceral correlates of conditioned fear, including the PAG, parabrachial nuclei, solitary nucleus, and DVC (Hopkins and Holstege, 1978). /// Neurons from parabranchial area (PB) receives inputs from CeA [@Bester1995]  -->
Specificly, CeM is the sole source of amygdala projections to the periaqueductal gray, which generates freezing (LeDoux et al. 1988), the most common index of conditioned fear. 
Moreover, CeM neurons fire at high rates during fear-inducing conditioned stimuli (Ciocchi et al. 2010; Duvarci et al. 2011), and optogenetic activation or inactivation of CeM triggers or impairs freezing, respectively (Ciocchi et al. 2010).



Finally, as with the majority of cells in the striatum, projections from the central nuclei are predominantly GABAergic while the basolateral nuclei have glutamatergic projections (42, 244, 269).<!--sah-->


Hence, the BLA transmits information widely throughout cortical regions, but its neuronal processing is greatly affected by excitatory projections from these regions. 
Predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the striatum, especially the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the CeA. 
In turn, the striatum, BNST and CeA have been considered to mediate the translation of BLA signals to behavioural output. 
Of note, there are exceptions to this serial model of information flow; the BA and CeA also receive sensory inputs, and the CeA contributes to some behavioural processes independently from the BLA23,24

<!-- Luna and Morozov (2012) contrasted the microcircuitry of BLA inputs vs. anterior piriform inputs to the posterior piriform cortex. Although both structures were found to innervate deep pyramidal cells of the posterior piriform, the BLA and anterior piriform connected with different kinds of interneurons. Specifically, the BLA produced strong connections with fast-spiking interneu- rons, whereas the anterior piriform had its strongest synapses on irregular-spiking interneurons. As these different classes of interneurons synapse on different regions of the pyramidal cells (somatic vs. distal dendritic), the feedforward inhibition from BLA vs. anterior piriform inputs would be expected to have profoundly different effects on the likelihood of spiking in the principal cells of the posterior piriform. -->

#### Amygdala and neuroinflammation
<!-- raczej we wcześniejszym rozdziale...-->
Amygdala is considered to be an essential component of the brain circuitry that forms the neural response to systemic immune activation [@Gaykema2007] and it is involved in sickness behavior [@Dantzer2008, @Goehler2007, @Roozendaal2009]. 
Regarding neuroinflammation circuit, pro-inflammatory cytokines signal the brain mainly through the activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to amygdala [@Goehler2000, @Quan2008]. 
Therefore, it is important to get better insights into brain activity during acute and chronic immune responses.
Evidence from many animal studies indicates that LPS significantly increases c-fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and, to a lesser extent, in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) [@Engler2011, @Frenois2007, @Vitkovic2000]. 
Moreover, functional and neuroanatomical studies indicate that peripheral immune activation may also affect amygdala function in humans. 
For example, depressive-like symptoms and anxiety can be transiently elicited in healthy human subjects by peripheral administration of LPS [@Grigoleit2011, @Harrison2009, @Wright2005]. 
These findings suggest that in humans, similar to rodents, the amygdala is involved in the integration of behavioral and immune responses.
A recent study documented that LPS-induced anxiety in mice as well as a pronounced increase in sEPSC frequency resulting in the hyperexcitability of BLA neurons were mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@Yang2016]. 
This suggests that alterations of CXCL12 signaling in this area play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation, and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety, a key component of a sickness behavior. 
Several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@Nishiyori1998, @Tarrozo2003], suggesting a possible influence on amygdala function. 
Although CX3CL1 also modulate synaptic activity and has been shown to modulate glutamate and GABA release in the hippocampus [@Ragozzino2006] and dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2009a], its neuromodulatory role in other brain centers remains unknown. 
Surprisingly, so far there have been no neurophysiological studies of CX3CL1 effects in the amygdala.

<!--In summary, recent studies have demonstrated that the BLA–CeA circuitry is involved in a diverse array of behaviours in addition to those related to fear. 
The key to understanding the production of these different behaviours is in the functional anatomy. -->
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution [@jarvis_2005], better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.

Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enables to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- zmienć -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs, but also on their timing and origin. <!-- zmienić // ładne podsumowanie-->
