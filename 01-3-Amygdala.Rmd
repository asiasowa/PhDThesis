## Amygdala       

The amygdala, a complex comprised of heterogenous collection of nuclei, is located in the medial temporal lobe. 
Its nulei can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: @duvarci_2014).
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this structure, there is no <!--anatomical--> standardization of amygdaloid nuclei terminology. <!-- although there is no standardization in relation to correct term, -->
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes <!--synonym-->the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) [@mcdonald_1998; @sah_2003].
However, here the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, as it was presented in many excellent papers focusing on these domains due to their contribution in fear-conditioning (@bocchio_2016; @duvarci_2014; @ehrlich_2009; @pape_2010; @spampanato_2011, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalastr)).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere [@pitknen_1997; @sah_2003]. <!--check citations and more? -->

### Functions

This limbic region is involved in very distinct behaviors related with learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction [@ehrlich_2009; @herry_2010; @ledoux_2000; @roozendaal_2009].<!-- Accumulating evidence indicate that amygdala is involved in. wcześniej: mood regulation, fear-conditioning/associative learning, and modulation of cognitive functions-->
At first glimpse, this variety of functions could be surprising, but most of them are related<!--inne słówko // reduced?--> to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning and its malfunctions. 
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events, so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie --><!-- plus dodać tutaj o modelu? -->
This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning. 
For example, during fear conditioning, an neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior [@janak_2015; @ledoux_2000].
Therefore, amygdala has been conserved throughout evolution and even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals [@janak_2015]. 
Amygdala is also an important player in tuning autonomic responses to homeostatic challenges, including those of the peripheral immune system [@pachecolpez_2005]. <!--więcej cytowań / lepiej napisać-->
Recent technological advances and approaches, including optogenetic and pharmacogenetic, in conjunction with genetic targeting of specified cells, battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, enable to determine how neuronal activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes.
Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have<!--inne słówko--> widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @pape_2010; @sah_2003), further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. <!-- figure ? illustrating amygdala as a hub?-->
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the role, anatomy, and physiology of this fascinating and complex brain structure. <!-- brzydkie zdanie napisać jakoś lepiej.... /// This has led to new insights into behavioral functions of amygdala neuronal activity, revealing a complex picture of amygdalar control of behavior. // The fear circuitry orchestrates defense mechanisms in response to environmental threats.

### Structure and Connectivity {#amygdalastructure}
<!-- Anatomy and Physiology? // As a group, amygdala nuclei receive inputs from and project to virtually all levels of the central nervous system. -->
#### The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) {#BLAstructure}

The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter is also known as accessory basal nucleus (@krettek_1978, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalastr)). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
All these nuclei are often referred as the basolateral nucleus (BLA) and hereafter this term will be used.<!-- In order to avoid misunderstanding, I will refer to the basolateral complex as BLA and basal/basolateral nucleus as B. -->
The BLA is considered to be the main point of the entry for cortical and subcortical sensory inputs into the amygdala (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @lalumiere_2014; @sah_2003a). 
This complex developmentally and structurally is a cortical-like structure [@waclaw_2010]. 
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @mcdonald_1993; @spampanato_2011]. <!-- figure? i może usunąć review i dać jednak ... research?-->

##### Neuronal Composition <!-- choć może cellular i tutaj też astrocyty? -->

###### Principal cells {#PC}

Principal cells (PC) show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal pyramidal counterparts.
Moreover, they represent a rather heterogeneous group with different subpopulation based on those characteristics; however, these variables seem not to be inter-correlated [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- However, no correlation was found between their neuronal firing properties and morphology  /// microglia represent a rather heterogeneous community with different subpopulation based  on  specific  brain  regions.  Each  microglia  subpopulation develop   unique   features   and   they   can   be   distinguished   by capacities and functions -->
Morphologically, PCs are characterized by large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite [@mcdonald_1982].<!--  see figure? --><!-- (McDonald 1982, 1984, 1992). /// Previous morphological characterization of BLA principal cells has revealed that these neurons exhibit large, complex dendritic arbors and contain a more prominent apical dendrite similar to that of cortical neurons (McDonald 1982). ///  Our data also show that principal cell dendrite spine density increased at distal regions compared with proximal regions [@klenowski_2015]-->
Based on their morphological profile, BLA neurons display variation in soma volume [@klenowski_2015] and/or shape (triangle vs. stellate-like morphology, @faber_2001, @par_1995). <!-- as well as shape of dendritic trees -->
Electrophysiologically, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections [@faber_2001; @par_1995], which forms an continuum. <!-- the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms an continuum: -->
At one end cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas at the other end their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- może jakiś figure i trochę lepiej napisać? see Fig. in methods?-->
Moreover, more prominent spike frequency adaptation were associated with more prominent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and higher expression of calcium-activated potassium channels in those cells [@faber_2001; @faber_2002; @sah_1996]. <!-- HERE: additional electrophysiological features of principal cells /// Additionally, another electrophysiological characteristics of principal neurons in BLA are: relatively wide  action potentials (half-width = 1.2 ms), ....., .....-->
Additionally, a small subset of PCs display bursting activity which is thought to be due to the presence of low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current [@par_1995]. <!-- ładniej napisać, wcześniej Interestingly, some of them display bursting activity or a delay in firing when depolarized from more negative membrane potentials, which is thought to be due to the presence .// consistent with the reported persistent lack of expression of the KCC2 transporter in hippocampal Cajal-Retzius cells -->
However, it is not clear to what extent these differences in firing pattern are reflective of distinct principal cells' subpopulations and what their functional significance might be. <!-- może zmienić trochę bardziej? -->

###### Interneurons {#BLAinter}

In contrast to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002; @mcdonald_2004]. <!-- BLA interneurons generally have smaller cell bodies compared with principal cells, lack spines, and have no apparent apical dendrite (McDonald 1982).-->
According to their dendritic trees, they could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, and bipolar cells [@mcdonald_1982]. 
Moreover, their dendrites can be either aspiny or spiny [@klenowski_2015]. <!-- lepiej napisać /// After we divided our interneuron data set into spiny and aspiny interneurons on this basis, examination of these subgroups did not reveal any significant morphological differences, nor did we find any obvious localization patterns, as each BLA subnucleus we sampled from contained both spiny and aspiny interneurons (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we found that interneurons classified as spiny had similar proximal and distal spine densities compared with principal cell basal dendrites. This finding is noteworthy, as previous studies have suggested that BLA interneurons are generally spine sparse or aspiny (McDonald 1982; Sah et al. 2003; Washburn and Moises 1992).@klenowski_2015-->
Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their expression of the same neurochemical markers. 
Although brain regions may differ in relative ratios of interneuron types.
In the BLA, the main two non-overlapping groups are those expressing calbindin (CB+) and calretinin (CR=) representing around 50% and 20% of all interneurons in the BLA, respectively [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002]. 
Each of these groups can be further sub-divided based on their expression of somatostatin (SOM+), vasoactive intestinal peptide  (VIP+), cholecystokinin (CCK+), and parvalbumin (PV+) (for a review, see: @spampanato_2011). <!-- można by było zrobić  różnymi kolorami interneurony w BLA i CeA ale nie wiem czy nie za dużo pracy... -->

Regarding the electrophysiological profile of BLA interneurons, contrary to principal cells, they show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously *in vivo* at high frequencies (10-15 Hz)  [@spampanato_2011; @pare_1995]. <!-- figure? -->
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons [@petillainterneuronnomenclaturegroup_2008], but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004]. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Specifically, electrophysiological analyses have identified at least six distinct types of firing properties [@jasnow_2009; @mahanty_1998; @sosulina_2010; @woodruff_2007]. <!-- figure ? -->
However, there is no correlation between neurochemical markers and electrophysiological profile. 
For example, four electrophysiologically separable types of cells were found to express PV in combination with either CCK or CB [@sosulina_2010]. 
Although the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity  is currently unclear, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and may modulate local circuits differently. <!-- cytowanie? yup, szczególnie ważne!!!!

<!-- + KANAŁYYYYYYYYYY -->

##### Connectivity

###### Afferents

Sensory information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory and visceral, auditory, and visual) converge in the BLA (for a review: @pape_2010, @sah_2003). 
It is carried by afferents from brain regions, including thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex, entering the amygdala *via* the external or internal capsules [@sah_2003]. <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review?-->
Moreover, the BLA complex is known to have strong reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially its medial part, perirhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, and the hippocampus, which are known to be involved in long-term declarative memory and suggests high functional relevance [@duvarci_2014; @par_2002]. <!-- trochę bardziej poprawić...--><!-- The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are interconnected brain structures involved in the extinction of conditioned fear. Here, we show that a defined subpopulation of basal amygdala (BA) projection neurons targeting the prelimbic (PL) subdivision of mPFC is active during states of high fear, whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic (IL) subdivision are recruited, and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity, during fear extinction. Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memoriesdependson thebalanceofactivitybetween two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways.  @senn_2014 -->

<!-- FEAR CONDITIONING-->
A large body of evidence highlight the role of these afferent in acquisition of fear conditioning [@blanchard_1972; @ledoux_1990]. <!-- Considerable work indicates that long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses transmitting CS information to the BLA underlies fear conditioning conditioning. That is, the ability of the once neutral CS to generate defensive behavior is mediated by an LTP-mediated increase in synaptic transmission onto BLA principal neurons ( Bocchio et al., 2017 ). -->
Principal cells in the BLA, especially its lateral part, are described to<!--może jakoś inaczej?--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS and a strong input carrying US information when these experiences are paired. 
This leads to LTP at those excitatory synapses onto LA neurons, and in turn, enables CS alone to activate them and induce the freezing behavior.
Consistently, for example, it was shown that photoactivation of LA axonal terminals from the auditory thalamus (the medial geniculate nucleus, MGN) and the auditory cortex (AC) when applying footshock (without a neutral tone) results in<!-- were shown to produce?--> conditioned freezing and synaptic potentiation [@nabavi_2014].
Moreover, @kim_2017 by using strains of knockin mice with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV-DIO-eYFP)  to functionally label neurons activated by discriminative auditory fear conditioning paradigm,  found that AMPA/ NMDA ratios were increased specifically in CS+, but not CS- afferents to LA neurons, indicating an input-specific, postsynaptic increase in glutamatergic transmission. <!-- Using this approach, CS+ terminals were first functionally labeled (CHr2-eYFP) during tone presentations after tamoxifen administration. Two weeks later the animals underwent fear conditioning with several conditioning trials (CS+ paired with US) to label LA neurons (tdTomato) activated  by  fear  conditioning.  After 4 days, the animals received discriminative conditioning and were sacrificed thereafter.  As  predicted  by  Hebbian models,  AMPA/NMDA  ratios  in  CS+  Figure 1. Input-Specific LTP in the Lateral Amygdala during Discriminative Fear Conditioning Prior to fear conditioning, sensory afferents carrying information concerning conditional stimuli (CS+, CS - ) from the auditory cortex (ACx) and medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) converge on principal neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA). During conditioning, coincident pre- and post-synaptic activity (red, active synapses and post-synaptic neurons) leads to input-specific long-term potentiation (LTP) at auditory afferents carrying CS+, but not CS - , information. Potentiated CS+ synapses (blue) allow the formerly innocuous CS to drive fear responses by depolarizing LA principal neurons. Neuron afferents (expressing ChR2) were only elevated in recordings from tdTomatopositive LA neurons labeled by fear conditioning, but not in non-labeled neurons./// Again, increases in AMPA/NMDA ratios recorded from LA neurons active during conditioning were specific to CS+ inputs, because randomly selected ACx/MGN afferents did not exhibit changes in AMPA/NMDA ratios in either labeled or non-labeled LA neurons.-->
Moreover, none of the experiments revealed changes in presynaptic site of synaptic efficacy.
<!-- A fundamental property of LTP is that it is only induced at synapses at which there is correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity  (e.g.,  presynaptic  neurotransmitter release coupled with postsynaptic depolarization). It has been argued that the ‘‘input specificity’’ of LTP might serve as a putative mechanism for the selectivity of conditioned fear responses to CSs that predict danger over those that do not ( Shin et al., 2006 ). //// label tone-responsive neurons in the ACx and MGN. Tone exposure recruited substantial numbers of eYFP-positive neurons in the ACx and MGN, and a substantial proportion ( ~ 12%–15%) of those neurons were found to project to LA. Moreover, different populations of ACx/MGN neurons were recruited by tones of different frequencies, revealing frequency-dependent labeled lines projecting to the LA. //// found that AMPA/ NMDA ratios, a postsynaptic correlate of potentiated glutamatergic transmission, were increased in CS+ (but not CS - ) afferents to LA neurons. Moreover, increases  in  AMPA/NMDA  ratios  were specific to CS+ inputs and were not expressed in other auditory afferents to the LA. None of the experiments revealed changes in presynaptic indices of synaptic efficacy.
-->
Intriguingly, optical stimulation of a subset of principal neurons expressing Thy1 promoter did not affect freezing behavior during fear conditioning, but rather appeared to influence consolidation specifically for memories that oppose<!--coś z tym słówkiem jest nie tak--> fear conditioning [@jasnow_2013].<!-- Stimulation of these neurons enhanced the retention of the extinction learning [@jasnow_2013].-->

Like integrating CS and aversive stimuli by BLA neurons, CS can be paired with rewarding stimuli, such as sweet liquid or food pellets [@schoenbaum_1998; @tye_2007; @tye_2008].
Consistent with this notion, reward-induced conditioning responses <!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues--> are also associated with a synaptic potentiation in the BLA, and thereby mediating cue-triggered behavior [@clem_2010; @johansen_2010; @tye_2008]. <!-- nowsze cytowania i poprawić to zdanie... -->
Hence, learning about potential rewards is adaptive, as is learning about stimuli that predict danger, and both of them engage the amygdala [@janak_2015]. <!--poprawić.. Thus, not only fear conditioning, but also reward cue responses develop through long-lasting enhancement of glutamatergic inputs from sensory thalamic stimuli onto LA principal cells in the LA 78. ///  -> Hence, amygdala seems to be involved in learning a spectrum of of positive (rewarding) to negative (aversive) outcomes-->

However, the integration of sensory inputs and subsequent expression of behavioral responses is not only determined by the sensory excitatory inputs to BLA principal cells, but also BLA interneurons receive, to some extend, inputs from cortical and thalamic afferents, similar to principal cells [@smith_2000; @woodson_2000]. <!-- These cells (interneurons) ;  -->
Specifically, ultrastructural studies <!--inaczej-morphological studies? electron microscopic studies?--> revealed that these thalamo-amygdala  terminals  directly  synapses  onto  distal  dendritic  processes  of inhibitory neurons in the BLA [@woodson_2000].<!-- bardziej zmienić te wyniki //   made  direct  synaptic  contacts  onto  distal  dendritic  processes  of inhibitory neurons in the BLA These data provide morphological evidence that thalamic afferents synapse directly onto inhibitory interneurons in LA, and are consistent with the possibility that inputs from the auditory thalamus initiate feedforward inhibition in LA. This architecture could play an important role in the suppression of background neural noise, thereby enhancing the response of LA cells to incoming auditory stimuli. -->

In addition to excitatory inputs, BLA is strongly innervated by different types of neuromodulators, such as dopamine, serotonin (5-HT)<!-- moreeeee-->, which play crucial role in modulating BLA activity, which will be discussed more in detail later.<!--section -->

<!-- EXCEPTION Recent  studies  indicate  that  the  basolateral amygdala, like the neocortex and hippocampus, receives GABAergic inputs from the basal forebrain in addition to the well-established cholinergic inputs. @mcdonald_2011 -->

<!-- Luna and Morozov (2012) contrasted the microcircuitry of BLA inputs vs. anterior piriform inputs to the posterior piriform cortex. Although both structures were found to innervate deep pyramidal cells of the posterior piriform, the BLA and anterior piriform connected with different kinds of interneurons. Specifically, the BLA produced strong connections with fast-spiking interneu- rons, whereas the anterior piriform had its strongest synapses on irregular-spiking interneurons. As these different classes of interneurons synapse on different regions of the pyramidal cells (somatic vs. distal dendritic), the feedforward inhibition from BLA vs. anterior piriform inputs would be expected to have profoundly different effects on the likelihood of spiking in the principal cells of the posterior piriform. --><!-- sprawdzić cytowanie -->

However, it has been known that some cortical GABAergic neurons also project to other brain areas ( Alonso and Ko  ̈ hler, 1982 ). Long-range inhibitory cells have been found to reciprocally connect hippocampus and septum, hippocampus and entorihnal cortex, and different neocortical areas (reviewed in Caputi et al., 2013 ), as well as corticofugal neocortical GABAergic neurons projecting to the amygdala ( Lee et al., 2014b ) and...


###### Intrinsic connectivity

<!-- jakieś wprowadzenie...-->
<!-- PRINCIPAL CELLS output-->
Principal cells are connected to each other, however, mainly by long-distance collaterals.<!-- lepiej napisać --> 
This mean that there is a low probability of a projection to nearby pyramidal-like neurons.
These long-distance collaterals<!--synonym--> are seems to display preferential lateromedial directionality, i.e., PCs from lateral part send many projections onto neurons in the basal nuclei (B) [@duvarci_2014; @krettek_1978; @pitkanen_1997]. <!-- poprawić zdanie i fig ??? -->
<!-- Stimulation of either the ic, ec or BLA evoked a glutamatergic excitatory synaptic current (EPSC) which was mediated by both non-NMDA and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptors. The ratio of the amplitude of the NMDA receptor-mediated component measured at 1 40 mV to the amplitude of the α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) component measured at –60 mV was similar regardless of  whether EPSCs  were evoked  in the  ec, ic  or BLA neurons. We conclude that  pyramidal  cells  of  the  LA  receive  convergent  inputs  from  the  cortex,  thalamus  and  basal  nuclei.  At  all  inputs,  both  AMPA/ kainate and NMDA-type receptors are active and colocalized in the postsynaptic density @mahanty_1999-->

In addition to those long-range collaterals onto other cells of the same type, principal cells form local synapses with proximal interneurons [@szinyei_2000]. <!-- for example 11% -> on PV s. In contrast, as many as 11% of the terminals contributed by the intranuclear axon collaterals of BL projection cells established synapses with PV-immunoreactive elements. Since the axon terminals of PV-immunoreactive interneurons are enriched in GABA and they exclusively form symmetric synapses,  these  results  suggest  that  PV-immunoreactive  interneurons  are  predominantly involved in feedback inhibition in the BL amygdaloid complex smith_2000 -->
Particularly, these synapses contain AMPA receptors with low GluR2 subunit in the postsynaptic membrane [@mahanty_1998], and such composition is thought to results in strong inward rectification and calcium permeability [@washburn_1997].
Moreover, in contrary to PCs in the BLA or interneurons from other brain areas, their glutamatergic input contain no NMDA receptors [@mahanty_1998]. 
<!-- functional relevance of these properties?????? -->

<!-- interneurons connections to PCs and what subcellular target of PCs-->
It is well-established that the main source of GABAergic inputs onto BLA projection cells are local interneurons  (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2006; Rainnie et al. 2006; Woodruff and Sah 2007).
<!--ALTERNATIVELY!!!!! : Despite few exceptions, such as <!-- more examples?, the main source of GABAergic inputs onto BLA projection cells are local interneurons [@ehrlich_2009; @spampanato_2011]. --><!--figure?/// The integration of sensory inputs and subsequent generation of emotional responses is largely determined by the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory input to BLA principal cells (Davis et al. 1994), in addition to local inhibition provided by GABAergic interneurons (Ehrlich et al. 2009; Spampanato et al. 2011).// Previous studies have shown that a large amount of BLA inhibitory activity is provided by locally projecting interneurons (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2006; Rainnie et al. 2006; Woodruff and Sah 2007).-->

<!-- EXCEPTION Recent  studies  indicate  that  the  basolateral amygdala, like the neocortex and hippocampus, receives GABAergic inputs from the basal forebrain in addition to the well-established cholinergic inputs. @mcdonald_2011 -->
Furthermore, morphological analysis has revealed that BLA principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses [@muller_2006; @klenowski_2015].<!-- // principal cell apical dendrite structure is organized to support the formation of high levels of distal synaptic inputs, which are likely to be excitatory (Fig. 5). Furthermore, reduced proximal spine density suggests that this region may receive a greater portion of inhibitory inputs compared with distal dendrites. our neurochemical results show a  (Fig. 8), potentially facilitating inhibitory control of principal neuron firing (Miles et al. 1996). @klenowski_2015 // BLA principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with proximal dendrites having fewer spines but higher densities of neurochemical GABAergic synapses compared with distal dendrites.  --><!--Consistently, it was shown that axons from interneurons branch several times creating many axon collaterals and terminals near the cell body of principal cells [@millhouse_1983].-->

<!-- To maximize flexibility, the cortex relies on the existence of a large diversity of GABAergic INs, which, as discussed in this review, differ over a large array of parameters( Ascoli et al., 2008 ). Anatomically, cortical GABAergic INs show a variety of somatic,dendritic,and axonal morphologies,including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons ( Kawaguchi and Kubota,1997;Kubota, 2014;Markrametal., 2004;Somogyi etal., 1998 ).IN subtypes also differ in their input and output connectivity with different cell types(both PCs and INs),which determines their circuit affiliation ( Beierlein et al., 2003; Gibson et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2015; Pfeffer et al., 2013 ). Electrophysiologically, a plethora of firing patterns have been observed,a consequence of the interplay of membrane cable properties and ion channel composition defining the passive and active membrane biophysical properties among IN subtypes ( Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Markram et al., 2004 ). In addition, the efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs have been shown to differ among INs ( Beierlein et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2000 ). There is also evidence that the synapses of specific IN types are associated with GABA receptors differing in subunit composition, which can affect the kinetics of the GABAergic response ( Ali and Thomson, 2008; Freund, 2003 ). All these properties affect IN responses to excitatory inputs and their postsynaptic impact onto target cells. -->


Reflecting differential receptor expression, GABAergic IN subtypes also vary in their response to neuromodulators such as acetylcholine(Ach), serotonin(5-HT), noradrenaline, and dop

All these features highlight a large diversity within the GABAergic interneuronal population, and most can have tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations.

Although they represent a minority of all cortical neurons (10%– 15% in rodents; Meyer et al., 2011 ), their local axons ramify extensively. While all GABAergic INs release GABA on their postsynaptic targets, the differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity,synaptic kinetics,and intrinsic membrane properties result in highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control of the activity of principal neurons and local networks.

The PV group includes the FS basket and chandelier cells ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). Chandelier INs, also known as axo-axonic neurons, are the most recognizable INs in terms of morphology ( DeFelipe et al., 2013 ) due to the unique candlestick-like synaptic terminal arrays they form to specifically target the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells. In contrast, the much more numerous basket cells make perisomatic ‘‘basket’’ terminals on the soma and proximal dendrites of PCs and INs. By producing hyperpolarizing and/or shunting inhibition ( Fishell and Rudy, 2011 ) close to the site of action potential generation, both types powerfully influence the output of their target neurons.

GABAB receptors display high affinity for GABA, slow G-protein-coupled-mediated signaling, and a predominantly extrasynaptic localization ( Gonzalez-Burgos, 2010 ). Repetitive firing of individual cells or concerted action of several INs is thought to produce sufficient extracellular accumulation of GABA to activate extrasynaptic receptors ( Kim et al., 1997; Mody et al., 1994; Scanziani, 2000; Thomson and Destexhe, 1999; Thomson et al., 1996 ).

Electrical synapses mediated by gap junctions have been used as a defining feature of different IN subtypes and are a major component of the connectivity between INs. While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among related INs remains high, but apparently mainly among INs of the same class.

Moreover, recordings from apical dendrites in vitro showed that activity in L5 pyramidal neurons disynaptically coupled via the Sst INs directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in neighboring pyramidal neurons. In contrast, INs that target the perisomatic area of PCs, such as PV and Cck basket cells and chandelier cells, have a stronger influence on regulating the spiking output of the cell, its timing, and thus the firing synchrony of populations of neurons ( Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996; Royer et al., 2012 ).

the location of inhibition relative to excitatory inputs will affect how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor and summate and activate voltage-gated conductances.

Our Sholl analysis revealed an increased number of neurochemical GABAergic synapses at the soma and proximal dendrites of principal cells, which was reduced on dendrites with increased radial distance away from the soma (Fig. 8). bCoupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. This arrangement was also observed for BLA interneurons; however, densities of neurochemical GABAergic synapses at this cell type were significantly increased compared with principal cells (Fig. 7). Given that inhibitory input to BLA cells (McDonald et al. 2011) and locally projecting interneurons predominantly innervates perisomatic targets and subtypes shown to selectively target dendrites at distal regions (CB and somatostatin expressing) primarily interact with principal cells (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2007), the high density of neurochemical GABAergic synapses formed at distal dendrites of BLA interneurons may arise from non-local inhibitory input; however, the source of this input remains to be determined.

While it is conceivable that a proportion of the neurochemical GABAergic synapses we quantified arose via connections between neurons in and outside the BLA (presumably those formed at distal dendrites), we believe that the cellular organization observed within this region suggests that the majority are formed by BLA interneuron-BLA interneuron and BLA interneuron-BLA principal cell contacts. Hence, our data suggest that BLA interneurons not only provide strong regulation of principal cell output by targeting the soma and proximal dendrites but also form a densely interconnected inhibitory network consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron GABAergic contacts. This level of somatodendritic organization, coupled with reciprocal excitatory connections provided by principal cells (McDonald et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2000), which can fire synchronously (Pare et al. 1995; Pare and Gaudreau 1996), may facilitate the propagation of inhibitory signals within the BLA. Furthermore, the subsequent inhibitory feedback onto principal cells is thought to contribute to rhythmic cell firing and synchronization of BLA activity (Pare et al. 2002). This was recently demonstrated for rhythmic compound IPSCs of PV interneurons, which improved spike-timing precision and synchronized principal cell firing in the BLA (Ryan et al. 2012). [@klenowski_2015]

 PN axons and PV neurons, light microscopy revealed numerous synapse-like contacts between these structures. The main PV+ targets of PN axons were the somata and proximal dendrites of PV neurons, although there were also contacts with more distal PV dendrites. In many cases, the PN axons ran along PV somata and/or proximal dendrites, forming multiple contacts. However, the great majority the PN axon terminals did not contact PV neurons. These observations suggest that there are robust reciprocal perisomatic PN-to-PV connections that may be important for the precise timing of rhythmic activity in the basolateral amygdala. [@mcdonald_2005]

Synapses are made not only on principal neurons<!-- citation?-->, primarily<!--specifically?--> at distal dendritic processes and spines <!-- (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999)-->, but interneurons in the BLA have also were reported to receive monosynaptic contacts from those cortical and thalamic sensory afferents [@szinyei_2000]. <!-- zmienić? -->


and electron microscopic analysis has revealed that BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct patterns of axonal innervation (McDonald and Betette 2001; Muller et al. 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007). 
These analyses showed that BLA interneurons expressing calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV), which constitute ~ 50% of the cell population (McDonald and Mascagni 2001; Rainnie et al. 2006), formed axonal arborizations that target the soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment of principal cells (McDonald and Betette 2001; Muller et al. 2005, 2006). 
Dense interconnections are also formed between somas and axon terminals of PV-containing interneurons (Muller et al. 2005). 
Regional differences in the connectivity of interneuron subtypes are also observed for somatostatin-containing interneurons, which predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of principal cells (Muller et al. 2007).
More recently, an elegant study performed by Bienvenu and colleagues identified two additional interneuron subtypes, axo-axonic and amygdalostriatal. 
Axo-axonic cells primarily innervated the initial axon segment of principal cells, while amygdalo-striatal cells formed perisomatic innervation of principal neurons and also medium spiny neurons in the amygdala-striatum border (Bienvenu et al. 2012). 



<!-- electrophysiological basis of inhibitory potentials -->
Activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA~A~-receptor-dependent and slow, GABA~B~-receptor-dependent components [@washburn_1992]. 
Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these two types of inhibitory components originate from<!-- are due to activity of?--> distinct subpopulations of interneurons [@sugita_1992]. <!-- może coś nowszego?????? different interneurons in the BLA are responsible for generating the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor-mediated component of inhibitory synaptic current (263). zmienić -->
Moreover, in contrast to most other cells, the slow component of the inhibitory synaptic potential in BLA pyramidal neurons is in part generated by a calcium-activated potassium conductance that is activated by calcium influx *via* NMDA receptors [@danober_1998; @lang_1997], suggesting NMDAR coupling to calcium-activated potassium channels, at least in the lateral amygdala. <!-- This observation raises the possibility that NMDA receptors in lateral amygdala neurons might be coupled to calcium-activated potassium channels.-->

<!-- something in between? -->
For interneurons, the anatomical location of the GABAergic synapses on the postsynaptic cell in large part determines the functional impact of interneuronal activity on the target neuron.
Thus, interneurons targeting perisomatic regions are strategically placed to modulate somatic action potential generation (Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996), whereas those terminating more distally may prevent dendritic action potentials (Miles et al., 1996), modulate the induction  of  glutamatergic  synaptic  plasticity  (Magee  and Johnston, 1997), or gate the transfer of information along the somatodendritic axis (Buzsaki et al., 1996). At the network level, these effects are facilitated by the presence of chemically and electrically connected networks of homogeneous interneuron populations (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Gibson et al., 1999; Hestrin and Galarreta, 2005), allowing widespread control of glutamatergic principal neuron activity. @woodruff_2006

<!--interneurons output , AND inhibitory networks in the BLA-->
In contrast to principal cells, efferent connections of BLA interneurons appear to be distributed extensively, but mainly restricted to the local BLA network [@carlsen_1988; @mcdonald_2002]. <!-- cytowania review: Ehrlich et al. 2009; może coś nowszego? albo tylko review? -->
Moreover, BLA interneurons exhibited reduced dendritic tree and spine densities but had significantly higher densities of GABAergic synapses compared with principal cells, which is further supported by the observed increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) [@klenowski_2015]. 
Furthermore, similarly to what was observed in the neocortex and hippocampus<!-- citation??-->, in the BLA, interneurons form synaptic connections with each other, creating local circuit networks [@lang_1998]. <!-- nowsze cytowanie?--><!-- PV+ interneurons forms inhibitory network that may be ...

<!--network motifs -->
Alternatively, it is also possible that the activation of interneurons, such as PV-expressing cells, is due to strong excitatory inputs from local principal cells, indicating a feedback inhibition from these interneurons [@smith_2000].<!-- MOCNO ZMIENIĆ  I NIE ROZUMIEM  ///  However, it is possible that the excitatory inputs to interneurons are due to activation of axon collaterals of pyramidal cells, which indicates a feedback role for interneurons. /// The PV+ interneurons receive strong excitatory inputs from local BLA principal cells but weak inputs from the cerebral cortex [@smith_2000] suggesting a main role in feedback inhibition. /// Tracking studies in the cat and monkey found that cortical afferents form few if any synapses with parvalbumin positive neurons, while local afferents do make synapses onto them [@smith_2000]. -->


<!-- dodać kiedy feed forward? może SOM z Tremblay? /// SOMATOSTATIN???!!!!-->
These findings illustrate the notion that different populations of interneurons can have a feed-forward and/or a feedback role in the BLA. <!-- zmienić jeszcze mocniej //// These findings are consistent with the proposal that different populations of interneurons can have a feed-forward and/or a feedback role in the basolateral complex. gdzie ten proposal? -->
This pattern of local innervation within the BLA is regarded as critical for the generation of synchronous firing of principal cells, facilitating rhythmic oscillations and synaptic plasticity involved in consolidation of emotional memories [@klenowski2015; @mcdonald_2004].<!-- zmienić bardziej //  These networks may be critical for the generation of synchronized rhythmic oscillations involved in consolidation of emotional memories @mcdonald_2004-->

<!-- oscillatory activity of bla? -->
On the other hand, large inhibitory synaptic events underlie spontaneous and cortically-evoked membrane potential fluctuations of BLA pyramidal-like cells [@lang_1997; @popescu_2011]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
Since BLA interneurons fire robustly during oscillatory activity, inhibition of principal cells may also originate from feed-forward action of local GABAergic neurons [@lang_1998]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
An interesting recent study sheds light on this issue showing that CB-expressing interneurons mediate cortically-evoked feed-forward inhibition in the BLA [@unal_2014]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
Selective feed-forward and feed-back inhibition onto principal cells has been suggested to be mediated by different types of PV+ interneurons of the BLA [@woodruff_2007]. <!-- zmienić ? -->
It is clear from both functional and anatomical data that PV-expressing cells powerfully inhibit both principal cells as well as other interneurons [@muller_2005; @woodruff_2007]. <!--  zmienić--> 
Moreover, the  potent excitatory effect of a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons in the BLA was reported [@woodruff_2006]. 
A single action potential in a PV-expressing interneuron can evoke a rapid, biphasic, outward/inward current sequence in postsynaptic PV-positive interneurons. <!-- zmienić bardziej -->
Outward currents are monosynaptic GABAergic events, whereas inward currents are disynaptic and caused by activation of AMPA receptors, suggesting the recruitment of glutamatergic neurons. <!-- zmienić bardziej -->

The notion that BLA neurons contribute to consolidation of learning is further supported by several lines of evidence. 

Moreover, synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA [@bauer_2007; @pelletier_2004]. 
In addition, @huff_2013 highlighted the role of gamma frequency (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, induced in the BLA by bursts of light pulses, in enhancing retention. <!-- końcówka może inaczej?-->
In line with these findings, inhibition of BLA neurons impaired retention of the learning [@huff_2013].

<!-- chandelier cells and depolarization -->
On the other hand, chandelier cells, a subtype of PV-expressing interneurons, have recently received much attention due to the evidence of their rather excitatory action than inhibition of postsynaptic pyramidal cells in neocortex by their GABAeric synapses in the axon initial segment [@szabadics_2006].<!-- Chandelier cells have recently generated additional attention as a result of the discovery that in neocortex, GABAergic synapses in the axon initial segment have a depolarized reversal potential compared to those innervating the somatic domain due to a higher intracellular chloride concentration at the axon initial segment ( Szabadics et al., 2006 ). Consequently, axo-axonic cells may excite rather than inhibit their postsynaptic pyramidal cells ( Szabadics et al., 2006 ). /// However, we found that AACs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic GABAergic inputs. Excitation and signal propagation initiated by AACs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon. @szabadics_2006 --><!-- Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; @szabadics_2006 ). -->
However, this remains controversial ( Glickfeld et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014 ). <!-- It is not clear if depolarizing with a reversal potential still below threshold has predominantly an excitatory or shunting effect and will require further investigation, but it has been recently suggested that this depends on the excitatory state of the postsynaptic cell ( Woodruff et al., 2011 ).  @tremblay_2016-->

<!-- neuromodulation pt2 -->
All these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators. 
For example, dopamine was reported to exhibit<!--demonstrate--> an interesting target-specific effect induced by dopamine acting at PV-expressing principal cells or PV-expressing interneuron synapses [@chu_2012]. <!-- zmienić -->
Specifically, its presence selectively inhibited the release of GABA from PV+ interneurons to principal cells, but not to other interneurons. <!-- zmienić Specifically, @chu_2012 demonstrated that activation of D2 receptor in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in LA reduced GABAergic transmission only to principal cells, but not to interneurons. --> 
This target-specific neurochemical modulation enables a sharp disinhibition of principal cells not accompanied by a concomitant alteration of the inhibitory inputs. <!-- zmienić -->
Such a decrease of the inhibitory tone on BLA principal cells by dopamine may facilitate the induction of long- term potentiation at sensory afferents [@bissire_2003]<!--Bissieere2003-->and the formation of fear memories [@fadok_2009]. <!-- zmienić -->
While the balance of glutamate and GABA transmission within the BLA orchestrates learning, anxiety states and addition, these two neurotransmitter systems are tightly regulated by these molecules that fine-tune behavioral outputs. 
For example, by combining optogenetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, it was shown that while stimulating 5-HT terminals at low frequencies (< 1 Hz) resulted in a short-latency excitation of BLA interneurons, at higher frequencies (10–20 Hz) these cells showed both slow excitation and slow inhibition.
These findings illustrate<!-- elucidate?--> frequency-dependent, cell-type-specific control over BLA circuitry *via* 5-HT and glutamate, which often co-existed in the same neuron [@sengupta_2017]. <!-- jeszcze bardziej rozbudować? -->
<!-- Pharmacological analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by glutamate and not 5-HT because it was abolished by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists.

Interestingly, fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking INs displayed differential modulation by glutamate and 5-HT.
Furthermore, optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals did not evoke glutamate release onto BA principal neurons, but inhibited these cells directly *via* activation of 5-HT~1A~ receptors and indirectly *via* enhanced GABA release.  -->

As mentioned above (see Section \@ref()<!-- inputs -->), 
The reciprocal connections between BLA and the mPFC appear to be involved in a wide variety of behavioral and higher cognitive functions. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Therefore, Little and Carter (2012) investigated how BLA, ventral hippocampal, midline thalamus, and contralateral mPFC inputs to the layer two pyramidal neurons of the mPFC make synaptic connections. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The authors used optogenetics to target specific pathways by transducing the efferent structures with ChR2 and providing illumination to their axonal terminals in the mPFC. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Moreover, they combined their optogenetic manipulations with two-photon microscopy in order to determine the functional connections on a subcellular level. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The results from this study indicate that the different regions do, in fact, make different subcellular connections. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The BLA appears to make synaptic connections much closer to the soma, relative to other regions, especially the thalamic inputs. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Additionally, the BLA inputs target spines of an “intermediate” size, along with ventral hippocampal inputs, in contrast to the thalamic inputs to the large spines and the contralateral mPFC inputs to the small spines. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
As both the size of the spine and the distance from the soma govern the relative strengths of the inputs, these findings shed light on how different regions influence local circuit activity in other regions. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In a follow-up study, Little and Carter (2013) extended their findings, again using optogenetics combined with two-photon microscopy. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In this case, their findings indicated that BLA inputs to the mPFC were considerably stronger on mPFC neurons that innervated the BLA, compared to mPFC neurons that provide inputs to the contralateral mPFC. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Together, these findings have contributed to a deeper understanding for how the BLA and mPFC inter-act and, critically, provide a foundation for understanding how BLA inputs to the mPFC may regulate PFC activity and PFC- dependent functions.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Although many cortical regions are contacted by BLA axons, this review will only consider the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), because it plays a critical role in regulating conditioned fear (Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010).  <!-- sprawdzić -->

BLA projects to the ventral hippocampus, structure which is also involved in anxiety (Pitkänen et al., 1995, 2000; Bannerman et al., 2003). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Felix-Ortiz et al. found that inhibition of BLA afferents to the ventral hippocampus, via activation of halorhodopsin, decreased anxiety-related behaviors. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Similarly, stimulation of such afferents, using 20 Hz light pulses to activate ChR2, increased anxiety-related behaviors. 
Moreover, electrophysiology analysis suggested that the effects of stimulating BLA inputs to the ventral hippocampus were mediated through local circuit mechanisms involving both direct activation of principal cells in the hippocampus and indirect recruitment of inhibitory neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In other work, Felix-Ortiz and Tye (2014) examined optical stimulation and inhibition of the BLA axon terminals in the ventral hippocampus during tests of social behavior. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
In a resident-juvenile-intruder test, stimulation of these terminals, using 20 Hz light pulses, reduced social interactions of the resident, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased such interactions, suggesting that activation of this pathway increased anxiety in the animals whereas silencing of this pathway produced the opposite effect. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The effects with stimulation were blocked with microinjections of glutamate receptor antagonists into the ventral hippocampus, indicating that the results were due to stimulation of BLA axon terminals and the concomitant release of glutamate from those terminals. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Prior work has noted the existence of neurons within the basal nucleus of the BLA that are responsive to cues associated with footshocks and other neurons that are responsive to cues previously associated with footshocks that have been extinguished. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Senn et al. (2014) investigated whether such neurons also show distinct projection patterns to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
To perform a functional investigation of these subpopulations of neurons, retrogradely transported viruses containing Cre-recombinase were injected into either the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortex while a conditional viral vector expressing the opsins in a Cre-dependent manner was injected into the BLA. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
As a result, the opsins were selectively expressed in the IL-projecting neurons or the PL- projecting neurons, enabling illumination of the entire BLA to only stimulate or inhibit the specific subpopulation of neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Consistent with previous work suggesting a dichotomy between the dorsal regions of the mPFC (PL) and the ventral regions (IL) with regard to fear conditioning (Peters et al., 2009), the authors demonstrated that BLA neurons projecting to the PL are activated by unextinguished cues whereas those projecting to the IL are activated by extinguished cues. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Moreover, inhibition of IL-projecting neurons during cue extinction training produced a significant impairment in the retention of the extinction learning, compared to stimulating such neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Conversely, inhibition of the PL-projecting neurons during such training enhanced the retention of the extinction learning, compared to stimulating such neurons. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
While much previous research has focused on the mPFC inputs to the BLA in regulating fear extinction and expression, these findings provide evidence that BLA inputs to distinct mPFC regions also differentially influence such behaviors.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

<!-- oscillations and hippo - BLA connectivity -->
<!--  Studies in humans (  Richardson  et al., 2004  ) and rodents (  Maren and Fanselow, 1995  ) indicate  that cooperation between amygdala and hippocampus is critical  for emotional memory formation. This communication involves  the synchronization of neuronal activity at theta (  q  ) frequencies  (4–10 Hz) across the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA)  and the CA1 hippocampal field. In fear conditioning, a model of  emotional memory, animals learn to associate a negative 

 Unconditioned animals show hippo-  campus-related  q  oscillations in BLA at the levels of individual  principal cells and neuron populations (as reflected in local field  potentials, LFPs) (  Pare   ́  and Gaudreau, 1996  ). Amplitude and  power of this rhythm increase after auditory, contextual or social  fear learning (  Jeon et al., 2010; Pare   ́  and Collins, 2000; Seiden-  becher et al., 2003  ). Moreover, the degree of  q  synchrony  between BLA and CA1 after fear conditioning predicts memory  performance (  Popa et al., 2010  ). Precise timing of activity in the  BLA is likely important not only for oscillations. It may also be crit-  ical for memory encoding, by selectively assigning emotional  valence to incoming sensory stimuli. [@bienvenu_2012]-->

Moreover, some set of projections are sent from both BLA and CeA. This connections are sent to BNST (Dong et al., 2001) and various hypothalamic nuclei (Pitkanen, 2000). <!-- zmienić @duvarci2014 -->
Finally, the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups (releasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline [NA], and dopamine [DA]) of the basal forebrain and brainstem (Steriade and Pare, 2007).<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

As part of understanding the precise role played by the BLA in such behaviors, Stuber et al. (2011) examined the pathway from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NA) core in modulating and driving reinforcement of operant behavior. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Although previous evidence had suggested that the BLA could directly influence dopamine release in the NA (Howland et al., 2002), a key mechanism for reinforcement, it was not clear whether activity in the BLA inputs to the NAcore could actually reinforce operant behavior or was necessary for reward seeking. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Stuber et al. found that mice engaged in an operant behavior (nose pokes) in order to receive optical stimulation (burst of 20 Hz light pulses) of the BLA axon terminals in the NAcore. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Similarly, optical inhibition, via activation of halorhodopsin, of the BLA terminals decreased responding for a sucrose reward. Strikingly, optical stimulation of mPFC inputs to the NAcore did not produce the same effects.<!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Other work has shown that optical stimulation of BLA inputs to the NAshell are also reinforcing (Britt et al., 2012), though, in contrast to the mPFC inputs to the NAcore, stimulation of mPFC inputs or ventral hippocampal inputs to the NAshell was also found to be reinforcing.  <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Together, these findings illustrate not only the increasing evidence for a role for BLA glutamatergic inputs to the NA in regulating reinforcement and reward but also that, depending on the part of the NA targeted, other glutamatergic inputs do not necessarily produce identical results <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

BLA is a key part of the neural circuit that drives drug-seeking behavior triggered by drug-associated cues (See et al., 2003). <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
However, as the BLA projects to both the PL and the NA core, both of which are considered critical components of a general drug-seeking circuit (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001; McFarland et al., 2004; LaLumiere and Kalivas, 2008), it has not been clear which pathway is responsible for driving cue-induced drug-seeking.  <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Recent work by Stefanik and Kalivas (2013) has used optogenetics to investigate this issue. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
The BLA was transduced with ArchT. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->
Inhibition of BLA terminals in either the PL or NAcore reduced cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking, indicating that activity in both pathways is obligatory for associative cue-driven cocaine-seeking. <!-- zmienić @LaLumiere -->

Of note, there are other pathways that originate in the BLA that have since been implicated in bidirectional regulation of anxiety. <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->
Optically driving BLA projections to the ventral HPC (vHPC) is anxiogenic61 , whereas photostimulation of BLA inputs in the anterodorsal BNST (adBNST) is anxiolytic62. <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->
Photostimulation of the BLA–Vhpc pathway also decreases social interaction63, an effect perhaps related to the increase in anxiety that is seen following BLA–vHPC activation64 <!-- zmienić janak 2015-->

BLA principal neurons send projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (Tye et al. 2011), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Weller and Smith 1982), nucleus accumbens (Stuber et al. 2011), and medial prefrontal cortex (Senn et al. 2014) to facilitate the coordination of emotional responses. 

However, importantly, principal cells in the BLA innervate the CeA, either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses on CeA neurons (@krettek_1978, @lopezdearmentia_2004, see Section \@ref(CeA)) or indirectly *via* GABAergic ITC~m~ neurons<!--explain-->, leading to feed-forward inhibition [@jngling_2008, @royer_1999].<!-- poprawić to zdanie -->

Hence, the BLA transmits information widely throughout cortical regions, but its neuronal processing is greatly affected by excitatory projections from these regions. 
Predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the striatum, especially the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the CeA. 
In turn, the striatum, BNST and CeA have been considered to mediate the translation of BLA signals to behavioural output. 
Of note, there are exceptions to this serial model of information flow; the BA and CeA also receive sensory inputs, and the CeA contributes to some behavioural processes independently from the BLA23,24

<!-- valence
In order to survive,animals must be able to discriminate dangerous stimuli from those that are safe.
Without a mechanism for learning specific stimulus-outcome relationships, fear  and  defensive  behavior  broadly generalize to many stimuli and settings. This is a maladaptive state of affairs that may underlie fear and anxiety disorders.

Under this model, the responses of BLA cells to conditioned stimuli (CSs) and the activity that drives CRs are closely related. We tested the strength of this correlation using a task where rats could emit different CRs in response to the same CSs. At odds with this model, the CS responses and CR-related activity of individual BLA cells were separable. Moreover, while the incidence of valence-coding cells did not exceed chance, at the population level there was similarity between valence coding for CSs and CRs. In fact, both lateral and basolateral neurons concurrently encoded multiple task features and behaviors. Thus, conditioned emotional behaviors may not depend on the recruitment of single cells that explicitly encode individual task variables but from multiplexed representations distributed across the BLA.@kyriasi_2018

#### Intercalated masses {#ITCs}

Intercalated neurons (ITCs) do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the amygdala. <!-- figure -->
In particular, these fiber bundles are the external capsule bordering on the lateral part of the BLA and the intermediate capsule separating the BLA from the CeA. <!-- figure-->
Clusters located in the external and intermediate capsules are here referred to as lateral (ITC~L~) and medial (ITC~M~), respectively.
ITCs are GABAergic cells with small (10–15 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) ovoid cell bodies [@mcdonald_1993; @nitecka_1987]. 
Their dendritic trees are spiny, flattened, long, and mostly remains within border of<!--constrainted within?--> the fiber bundle where their soma is located [@millhouse_1986]. 
Regarding their electrophysiological features, ITCs have higher membrane resistance and firing frequency compared with BLA and CeA interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @royer_2000]. 
Their high intrinsic firing frequency could be explained by their expression of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) after action potential, reflecting slowly-inactivating K+ currents (I~SD~) [@royer_2000]. <!-- zmienić -->
Additionally, these neurons are surrounded by a small subset of larger (>50 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) cells with long thick dendrites. 
Still, little is known about these neurons within ITC masses. 
Previously, they were regarded as cholinergic neurons [@nitecka_1989]; however a more recent report demonstrated their GABAergic nature and strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (mGluR1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`), GABA~A~ receptors `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`1 subunit, and parvalbumin (PV) [@bienvenu_2015].
<!-- new studies? -->

##### Connectivity

<!-- These cells receive sensory input as well, participating in fear conditioning. jakoś tak to zacząć albo olać ...!! albo regarding their connectivity ??--> 
Besides their well-known inputs from BLA principal cells, ITCs express the highest density of `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala [@jacobsen_2006; @palomarescastillo_2012; @pape_2010]<!--[@marowsky_2005]-->, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems. <!-- zmienić -->

In addition to their distinct inputs, intercalated neurons are interconnected <!--form GABAergic reciprocal synapses onto other intercalated cell /// [@Geracitano2012; @Royer2000]dodać cytowania--> within each cluster as well as between clusters, at least between dorsal and ventral medial clusters []. <!--  within each ITC cluster,  -->

<!--Little is known about the intercalated cell cluster in the external capsule. It was documented that these cells form synapses with BLA neurons and does not project to CeA [@marowsky_2005]. POPRAWIĆ i może wiadomo już coś więcej? It is tempting to speculate that similar to their medial counterparts, these intercalated neurons modulate cortical inputs to the BLA. 
Similar to BLA connections pattern, neurons in ITC cluster located dorsolaterally (ICMMD) send more projections to the CeM than CeL, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in dorsally located ITC mass  <!-- [@Royer1999; @Pare1993] DODAĆ PÓŹNIEJ CYTOWANIA-->

In addition to common GABA~A~ receptor, GABA~C-like~ receptor, insensitive to bicuculine, has been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses between ITCs and CeL neurons. <!-- moje zdanie-->

The two GABA receptor types appear to be localized to different GABAergic inputs onto CeL neurons.
Thus, inputs from the intercalated neurons that form synapses onto the dendrites of CeL neurons express both GABAA- and GABAC-like receptors. <!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->
These results suggest that the different GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of the central amygdala (47).<!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003--><!-- trochę nie ogarniam czy w końcu jest rozróżnienie czy nie na te dwa podtypy receptorów w różnych komórkach?!?!?!?! -->

#### Central amygdala {#CeAstructure}

Central amygdala (CeA), mainly a GABAergic nucleus, is comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM) and intermediate (CeI) divisions [@jolkkonen_1998; @mcdonald_1982a; @sah_2003]; however, the classification of these regions is inconsistent. <!-- inne cytowanie? problem z nim bo takiego nie ma  [@Cassell1986].-->
Importantly, the capsular region of the CeA appears to overlap with intercalated cell clusters [@mcdonald_1982a; @pape_2010] and will be hereafter referred to as ITCs. <!-- sprawdzić na pewno -->
However, CeA is commonly divided into the CeL and CeM divisions and there is a sparse number of investigations regarding CeI and CeL as a functionally and anatomically distinct subdivisions [@ciocchi_2010; @duvarci_2014; @haubensak_2010]. <!-- sprawdzić cytowania....bo nie rozumiem.... Therefore, in this dissertation, the latter classification will be used. odwołanie się do figury!!!!-->
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), is also considered to be a part of extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and intra-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense inter-connectivity [@fox_2015; @sah_2003]. 
However, BNST is out of the scope of this dissertation and will not be discussed here. 

##### Neuronal composition

Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered as a main output nuclei [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016].
<!-- This is consistent with  -->
Neurons within this nucleus are diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and *in vivo* patterns of activity.<!-- figure /// with different functional and molecular features. -->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons [@mcdonald_1993; @sun_1993], further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA [@medina_2004; @waclaw_2010]. 
Precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neurons-like morphology,  <!--with numerous branches with high density of-->
On the other hand, CeM neurons have a large soma, dendrites with few branches with low density of dendritic spines [@cassell_1989; @mcdonald_1982a]. <!--[@Marina1999; @Hall1972-->

Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF) and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), both accounting for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of whole CeA neuronal population and are:<!--inny czasownik?--> (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells [@marina_1999]. <!-- figure-->

<!-- description of Late Firing neurons--><!-- exhibiting a substantial delay to action potential (AP) initiation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. -->
LF neurons display a pronounced delay before onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. <!-- figure? -->
It is thought that this characteristic delay<!--synonym--> is mediated by K~v1~-dependent slowly inactivated D-type K^+^ currents [@hou_2016; @martina_1999].

<!-- description of Regular Spiking neurons -->
generating repetitive firing spikes [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004].


Fast-spiking cells shows a high membrane resistance and a high action potential frequency (>40 Hz), showing no accommodation, analogous to a subtype of interneurons present in the cortex, the hippocampus or the BLA,  discussed in previous section. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with > 1 ms in other cell types in CeA. <!-- citations? -->
They have also higher frequency of spontaneous synaptic potentials (sEPSPs). <!-- citations? -->
<!--  CeA neurons display aspiny morphology. which one? citations? -->
<!--These neurons likely correspond to local-circuit cells.  which one? -->
<!-- neuromarkers and morphology? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Low-threshold bursting cells are endowed with T-type calcium channels, giving rise to spike bursts. <!-- citations? -->
One of their characteristics is the presence of rebound spikes after hyperpolarizing current step [@dumont_2002; @hou_2016]. <!-- fig -->
<!-- neuromarkers? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Like neurons in striatum, neuronal cells in CeA also express wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including protein kinase C`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` (PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`), somatostatin (SOM), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin and others [@cassell_1989; @haubensak_2010].
Of these, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` and SOM are the two most highly expressed and largely non-overlapping neurochemical markers [@haubensak_2010; @hunt_2017; @li_2013].
<!-- inne przejście ale połączyć -->
Considering the expression of immunohistochemical markers, together with their electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections, two groups of CeA neurons have emerged: those expressing protein kinase C `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+) or somatostatin (SOM+). <!-- -->
<!--Of note, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` marker is specific to CeA. -->
PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+ neurons form relatively homogeneous group, which is comprised mainly of late-firing cells (~85%).<!-- and these neurons are predominantly described as late-firing (LF) neurons -->
These neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> following a fear conditioning protocol and thus are often referred as CeL~off~ cells. <!-- Following fear conditioning, these neurons respond to the CS with a reduction in activity and have therefore been called Ce- LOFF cells (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010). -->

In contrary, most of the PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells are SOM+.
However, those cells are classified as both late-firing (40%) or regular-spiking types (60%). <!-- może jakoś inaczej napisać -->
Moreover, these neurons respond to the fear conditioning with an increase in activity, and have, therefore, been termed CeL~ON~ neurons [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013]. 
Hence, it is plausible that these distinct populations fulfill different functional roles. <!-- We suggest that PKC␦-expressing and SOM- expressing neurons form heterogeneous populations of neurons, with different populations contributing to different behavioral outcomes. Understanding the flow of information through the CeA and its outputs, in a behaviorally specific and relevant manner, will be a challenge for future experiments. Hunt 2017-->

##### Connectivity
###### Afferents

<!--Although pieces of information are continually emerging, these circuit analyses reveal a rich interaction between the LA and CeL — and among neurons within the CeL — in both acquiring and expressing conditioned freezing in response to a fear cue, as well as multiple neural projections from the CeL that may regulate this behavioural response. @janak_2015-->

In particular, whereas LA exclusively projects to CeL, the BA nuclei additionally make synapses onto CeM neurons [@krettek_1978]. <!-- poprawić jakoś -->
Moreover, neurons in the LA preferentially make synapses onto ITC cluster located dorsally (ITC~DM~), whereas ventral medial cluster (ITC~VM~) receives input from BL and BM principal cells [@royer_2000]. <!-- poprawić i figure ... -->


The BLA was shown to form functional excitatory synapses on SOM+ and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells in the CeL (CeL:SOM+), and the excitatory strength of these synapses greatly increased as a result of fear conditioning (Li 2013). 
<!-- shorten -->
A second population of CeL neurons, which is largely separate from the PKC(+) population, expresses somatostatin [somatostatin-positive (SOM+); Li et al., 2013]. 
These neurons receive direct synaptic input from the lateral amygdala, which is potentiated following auditory fear conditioning (Li et al., 2013). 
Electrophysiologically, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons which are predominantly SOM(+), have been described as either LF or regular spiking (RS). 
Following fear conditioning, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-positive neurons respond to the CS with an increase in activity, and have therefore been called CeL~ON~ neurons (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010), which likely also correspond to SOM-negative<!-- ???--> neurons (Yu et al., 2016). 

neurons in both the CeM and CeL receive glutamatergic inputs from the lateral and basal nucleus which activate both AMPA and NMDA receptors [(Royer and M de A 2004)]]. <!-- zmienić -->
Excitatory inputs to CeL neurons also express presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (186). <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
As in many other regions of the central nervous system  (132, 207), activation of these receptors leads to depression of the synaptic input. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
The activity of these receptors is modulated following kindling and chronic cocaine treatment 186 . <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
These findings suggest that alterations in synaptic efficacy at inputs to the CeA may be involved in the changes seen in epilepsy and behavioral sensitization to cocaine. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->

Besides their previously described inputs from either BLA or ITCs, CeA is also innervated by structures outside the amygdaloid complex. 
For example, stimulation of axons from parabrachial nucleus projecting to CeL was reported to results in suppression of appetite  [@carter_2013], suggesting that CeL has many parallel circuits. <!--CeA receives projections from BNST [@Gungor2015]-->
In mice, reducing the activity of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons was found to block decreased feeding stimulated by sickness or unpalatable tastes 58. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
Conversely, optogenetic excitation of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice, and this was not a confound of reduced activity or increased anxiety. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
These results indicate that CeL:PKCδ+ neurons suppress feeding in response to anorexigenic stimuli58. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
multiple inputs to CeL:PKCδ+ neurons that are activated by anorexigenic signals, including the BLA, the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the insula (IN)58 <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić cytowanie do którego się odwołuje cai_2014-->

<!-- neuromodulators-->
<!-- Neurons in CeL and CeM express many neuropeptides (Gray and Magnuson 1987, 1992; Woodhams et al. 1983) that likely modulate fast inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission (Kash et al. 2015; McElligott and Winder 2009).  zmienić -->
Similar to BLA, CeA nucleus is strongly innervated<!--moze nie, skoro też ekspresjonują?--> by neuromodulators such as oxytocin <!--citations-->, dopamine <!-- citations-->, acetylocholine [@washburn_1992], norepinephrine [@faber_2002], serotonin <!--citations--> and opioids <!--citations?-->. <!-- jakoś inaczej// This picture is more complex when added a role of neuromodulators. //  more citations and figure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--> 
Specifically, hypothalamic axon terminals release oxytocin onto CeL neurons, resulting in their increased excitability [@knobloch_2012]. 
Moreover,  when these terminals are stimulated during fear conditioning, the freezing behavior is attenuated [@knobloch_2012]. <!--it leads to attenuation of freezing behavior ///  poprawić this is especially the case for.. -->

Thus, each nuclei receives unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
These findings contribute to our better understanding of functional and behavioral significance of those diverse sets of inputs to the amygdala.<!-- better written .... how specific inputs, and even genetically distinct inputs, to the amygdala regulate both behavior and local circuit activity --> 


<!-- gdzie tę końcową część umieścić? -->
The study conducted by @tye_2011 nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals <!-- or cell body --> in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased this behavioral phenotype. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feed-forward inhibition of the CeM [@ciocchi_2010; @tye_2011] <!-- poprawić i brak tego cytowania @Pare2004;// BLA-cell-body activation decreased time spent by mice in the open arms of an elevated plus maze (EPM), indicating an increase in anxiety-like behaviour --> 

Thus, a glutamatergic BLA projection to the CeA can promote anxiolytic behavior. <!-- poprawić -->

when ChR2 was selectively expressed in CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons to allow their direct photoactivation, increased time in the open arms of the EPM was observed 58. <!-- cai 2014  from janak_2015-->
These data support the notion that a population of BLA neurons preferentially excites CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons that lead to reduced anxiety, perhaps through the projection from CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ to CeM output neurons. <!-- nie ogarniam ... -->
Alternatively, the CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neuronal projection to the BNST, also implicated in anxiety [@kim_2013], could mediate anxiolysis. <!-- zmienić -->
These studies show that the BLA–CeA pathway does not universally promote aversive states. <!-- zmienić -->

More recently, it was found that distinct subtypes of CeL neurons contact CeM cells projecting to different brainstem sites. <!--@duvarci_2014 zmienić-->
In particular, CeM cells that project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are contacted by CeL neurons expressing oxytocin receptors (OR+), whereas CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) receive inputs from OR- CeL neurons (Viviani et al., 2011). 
It should be noted that many of the OR+ CeL neurons also express PKC<!--delta--> but not SOM and conversely for OR- CeL neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013).


###### Intrinsic connectivity 

Within CeA, neurons form GABAergic synapses with each other. 

A number of recent studies shed new light on the CeL undertaking an active role in the acquisition, consolidation, and extinction of conditioned fear (  Wilensky et al., 2006  ;  Ehrlich et al., 2009  ;  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Pare and Duvarci, 2012  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). The  CeL  microcircuit  consists  of  mostly  GABA-releasing (GABAergic) inhibitory neurons with different functional and molecular features (  Cassell et al., 1999  ;  Martina et al., 1999  ;  Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004  ;  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Amano et al., 2012  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). By making reciprocal inhibitory connections, these neurons provide both feedforward and/or feedback inhibition within the CeL (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). Recent optogenetic approaches have demonstrated that intra-CeL inhibition gates CeL output and therefore controls the function of CeM and the expression of fear (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Pare and Duvarci, 2012  ). The CeL contains diverse GABAergic neuron classes, but the synaptic organization of local inhibitory circuits in this region is largely unknown. <!-- hou_2016 -->


Recent study by combining an optogenetic approach with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings<!-- in order to determine the...?--> nicely illustrated that neurons within the CeL are extensively<!--densely--> interconnected, with local connections apparent between all types of neurons, but strongest between like neurons (SOM(+) `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`SOM(+) and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+) `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")` PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+))[@hunt_2017]. <!-- ZMIENIĆ JESZCZE BARDZIEJ -->
Moreover, by combining tracing, optogenetic, and electrophysiological techniques,<!--using similar approaches?--> it was demonstrated that both types of CeL neurons mainly unidirectionally project to CeM [@haubensak_2010; @jolkkonen_1998; @li_2013a; @petrovich_1997]. <!-- lepiej napisać i BRAKUJE cytowania @Cocchi2010] // substantial unidirectional connections between the CeL and the CeM (McDonald, 1982; Grove, 1988)-->
Neurons in both regions also make extensive local connections (McDonald, 1982; Sun and Cassell, 1993; Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998), with local glutamate excitation of CeL neurons evoking IPSCs in neighboring neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004). <!-- zmienić, poprawić, usunąć, zobaczyć cytowania? -->

Although both subtypes of CeL neurons inhibit one another and both project to the CeM52,53 , CeLON neurons respond to a fear CS at a shorter latency than CeLOFF52, suggesting that conditioned fear responses occur following activation of CeLON neurons that inhibit CeLOFF neurons projecting to CeM output neurons53 , thereby promoting freezing through disinhibition52,53. <!-- @janak_2015; zmienić-->

The presence of experience-dependent potentiation in the CeL indicates that this region is also important for acquisition of the CS–US association, as suggested by earlier studies17,40,52, rather than merely serving as a relay of information from the LA <!-- @janak_2015; zmienić-->

Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses. Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression. Such cell-type-specific transmission, modulation, and connectivity are likely to be critical for amygdala network function. [@hou_2016].

PKC␦(⫺) neurons inhibit PKC(⫹) neurons, which in turn project to the CeM (Haubensak et al., 2010).- Hunt2017

###### Efferents 

<!-- to add The CeA network then receives signals from the BLA and computes the inhibitory GABAergic output to various brain areas. <!-- zmienić -->
<!-- --> 
In addition to complex patterns of inputs<!--?-->, amygdala has also widespread efferent projections, including both cortical and subcortical regions. <!-- jakieś review, sah odwoływał się do P... z 2000 roku, więc coś nowszego...ewentualnie sah_2003// On the output side, the targets of the amygdala are extremely diverse, however the CeM is widely accepted to be the main output nuclei.--> 
As with the majority of cells in the striatum, but in contrast to BLA, projections from the CeA are predominantly GABAergic (for a review: @sah_2003).<!-- może zmienić bardziej? -->


<!-- PAG Keeping in mind that CeA is .... -->
Specifically, CeM is the sole source of amygdala projections to the periaqueductal gray, which generates freezing (LeDoux et al. 1988), the most common index of conditioned fear. 
Moreover, CeM neurons fire at high rates during fear-inducing conditioned stimuli (Ciocchi et al. 2010; Duvarci et al. 2011), and optogenetic activation or inactivation of CeM triggers or impairs freezing, respectively (Ciocchi et al. 2010).
Other amygdala outputs thought to contribute to conditioned fear include projections to BNST (Dong et al., 2001) and various hypothalamic nuclei (Pitkanen, 2000). <!-- CEA provides an important GABAergic input to the BNST, one that has been implicated as a critical pathway in the central stress system (Jasnow et al., 2004; Walker and Davis, 2008).-->

Finally, the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon<!-- przód mózgu --> via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups (releasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline [NA], and dopamine [DA]) of the basal forebrain and brainstem (Steriade and Pare, 2007).

<!-- to raczej nie po sobie -->
Indeed, nearly all brainstem projections of the amygdala are sent from CeM (Hopkins and Holstege 1978; Petrovich and Swanson 1997; Veening et al. 1984). <!-- Indeed, CeA supplies most amygdala projections to the brainstem nuclei that generate the behavioral and visceral correlates of conditioned fear, including the PAG, parabrachial nuclei, solitary nucleus, and DVC (Hopkins and Holstege, 1978). /// Neurons from parabranchial area (PB) receives inputs from CeA [@Bester1995]  -->

Thus, multiple plastic systems, and especially those integrating GABAergic neurons, could act in concert to encode aspects of stimulus associations in the amygdala.

### Summary of amygdala structure and connectivity

<!--In summary, recent studies have demonstrated that the BLA–CeA circuitry is involved in a diverse array of behaviours in addition to those related to fear. 
The key to understanding the production of these different behaviours is in the functional anatomy. -->
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution [@jarvis_2005], better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.
Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enables to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- zmienć -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs, but also on their timing and origin. <!-- zmienić // ładne podsumowanie-->

### Amygdala and its crosstalk with immune system
<!-- raczej we wcześniejszym rozdziale...-->
Amygdala is considered to be an essential component of the brain circuitry that forms the neural response to systemic immune activation  [@Gaykema2007] and it is involved in sickness behavior [@Dantzer2008, @Goehler2007, @Roozendaal2009]. <!-- dodać cytowania do PhD2-->
Regarding neuroinflammation circuit, pro-inflammatory cytokines signal the brain mainly through the activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to amygdala [@Goehler2000, @Quan2008]. 
Therefore, it is important to get better insights into brain activity during acute and chronic immune responses.
Evidence from many animal studies indicates that LPS significantly increases c-fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and, to a lesser extent, in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) [@Engler2011, @Frenois2007, @Vitkovic2000]. 
Moreover, functional and neuroanatomical studies indicate that peripheral immune activation may also affect amygdala function in humans. 
For example, depressive-like symptoms and anxiety can be transiently elicited in healthy human subjects by peripheral administration of LPS [@Grigoleit2011, @Harrison2009, @Wright2005]. 
These findings suggest that in humans, similar to rodents, the amygdala is involved in the integration of behavioral and immune responses.
A recent study documented that LPS-induced anxiety in mice as well as a pronounced increase in sEPSC frequency resulting in the hyperexcitability of BLA neurons were mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@Yang2016]. 
This suggests that alterations of CXCL12 signaling in this area play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation, and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety, a key component of a sickness behavior. 
Several studies have indicated the relative abundance of a CX3CL1 receptor within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@Nishiyori1998, @Tarrozo2003], suggesting a possible influence on amygdala function. 
Although CX3CL1 also modulate synaptic activity and has been shown to modulate glutamate and GABA release in the hippocampus [@Ragozzino2006] and dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2009a], its neuromodulatory role in other brain centers remains unknown. 
Surprisingly, so far there have been no neurophysiological studies of CX3CL1 effects in the amygdala.
