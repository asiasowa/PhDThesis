## Amygdala  {#amygdalamain}     

The amygdala, a complex comprised of a heterogeneous collection of nuclei, is located in the medial temporal lobe. 
Its nuclei can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: @duvarci_2014).
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this structure, there is no<!--anatomical--> standardization of amygdaloid nuclei terminology. <!-- although there is no standardization in relation to correct term, -->
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) [@mcdonald_1998; @sah_2003].
Here, the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA), and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers (@bocchio_2016; @duvarci_2014; @ehrlich_2009; @pape_2010; @spampanato_2011, see Fig. \@ref(fig:amygdalastr)).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere [@pitknen_1997; @sah_2003]. <!--check citations and more? -->

### Functions {#amygdalafunctions}

This limbic region is involved in surprisingly distinct behaviors related to learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction [@ehrlich_2009; @herry_2010; @ledoux_2000; @roozendaal_2009].
At first glimpse, this variety of functions could be surprising, but most of them are related<!--inne słówko // reduced?--> to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning and its malfunctions. 
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie --><!-- plus dodać tutaj o modelu? -->
This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning. 
For example, during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior [@janak_2015; @ledoux_2000].
Therefore, the amygdala has been conserved throughout evolution. 
Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals [@janak_2015]. 
Amygdala is also an important player in tuning autonomic responses to homeostatic challenges, including those of the peripheral immune system [@pachecolpez_2005]. <!--więcej cytowań / lepiej napisać-->
Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, determine how genetically targeted cellular activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for example, @lalumiere_2014). <!-- lepiej to napisać ... with ,-->
Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have<!--inne słówko--> widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @pape_2010; @sah_2003), further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. <!-- figure ? illustrating amygdala as a hub?-->
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the amygdala's role, anatomy, and physiology. 

### Structure and Connectivity {#amygdalastructure}
<!-- Anatomy and Physiology? // As a group, amygdala nuclei receive inputs from and project to virtually all levels of the central nervous system. -->
#### The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) {#BLAstructure}

The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (@krettek_1978, see Fig. \@ref(fig:amygdalastr)). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
All these nuclei are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter this term will be used.
The BLA is considered to be the main point of the entry for cortical and thalamic sensory inputs into the amygdala, which form axonal bundles and enter *via* external and internal capsule, respectively (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @lalumiere_2014; @sah_2003a). 
This complex displays cortical-like characteristics based on its developmental origin and structural organization [@waclaw_2010], although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization [@sah_2003]. 
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @mcdonald_1993; @spampanato_2011]. 

##### Neuronal Composition {#BLAcells}
<!-- choć może cellular i tutaj też astrocyty? -->

###### Principal cells {#BLAPC}

Principal cells (PCs) show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal pyramidal counterparts. 
In the BLA, PCs represent a rather heterogeneous group, forming subpopulations based on both morphological and electrophysiological features [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000].
Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite [@mcdonald_1982].<!--  see figure? -->
<!-- Reflecting ..?? Based on their morphological profile, -->However, these cells may vary in soma volume [@klenowski_2015] and/or shape (triangle vs. stellate-like morphology) as well as a structure of dendritic trees [@faber_2001, @par_1995; @klenowski_2015], reflecting the morphological heterogeneity of PCs population. 
Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections [@faber_2001; @par_1995].
The degree of this adaptation forms a continuum. <!-- the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms a continuum: -->
At one end, cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- może jakiś figure i trochę lepiej napisać? see Fig. in methods?-->
Moreover, more prominent spike frequency adaptation was associated with more prominent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and higher expression of calcium-activated potassium channels in those cells [@faber_2001; @faber_2002; @sah_1996]. <!-- HERE: additional electrophysiological features of principal cells /// Additionally, another electrophysiological characteristics of principal neurons in BLA are: relatively wide  action potentials (half-width = 1.2 ms), ....., .....-->
Additionally, a small subset of PCs displays bursting activity, which is thought to be due to the presence of low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current [@par_1995]. 
However, to what extent these differences in firing patterns reflect distinct principal cells' subpopulations and their functional significance is still unclear. <!-- może zmienić trochę bardziej? -->
Moreover, morphological and electrophysiological features of PCs are not inter-correlated [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- nie wiem czy to nie gdzieś indziej albo wywalić -->

###### Interneurons {#BLAinter}

BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of parameters, which was a subject of many excellent reviews [@hjos_2021; @prager_2016; @spampanato_2011].
In contrast to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002; @mcdonald_2004]. 
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and chandelier cells [@mcdonald_1982; @woodruff_2010]. 
Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology [@klenowski_2015]. 
It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons, which will be discussed below. 

Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population, and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons [@kemppainen_2000; @mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2001a; @mcdonald_2002; @muller_2003]. <!-- (Mascagni & McDonald, 2003) może zrobić figure? -->
Of note, these subpopulations can be further subdivided. 
For instance, there is a subpopulation of SOM+ neurons, which expresses neuropeptide Y (NPY), whereas the PV group includes the basket and chandelier cells, also known as axo-axonic neurons (AAC), which will be discussed in the next section (<!--see: \@ref(BLAinside); -->for reviews: @hjos_2021, @prager_2016, @tremblay_2016). <!-- PV+ basket cells (PVBCs) also express CB,  whereas PV+ AACs do not -->
Moreover, the relative ratios of interneuron types may differ between brain regions.
Within the BLA, they are roughly the same, except for PV-immunopositive interneurons.
As mentioned above, this subpopulation constitutes around 40% of BLA interneurons, except in the lateral subdivision, where PV-expressing cells represent only 20% of BLA interneurons. <!-- citation? -->

Electrophysiologically, contrary to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously *in vivo* at high frequencies (10-15 Hz)  [@spampanato_2011; @par_1995].<!-- figure? -->
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons [@petillainterneuronnomenclaturegroup_2008] but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004]. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns [@spampanato_2011]. <!--more recent reviews-->
Some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells [@rainnie_2006; @woodruff_2007], whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation [@jasnow_2009].
However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear. 
Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: @spampanato_2011, @tremblay_2016). 

##### Connectivity {#BLAconnectivity}

<!-- zdanie wprowadzające? coś w deseń, że amygdala ogarnia wiele funkcji, więc parallel microcircuits, complex connectivity // The  basolateral  nucleus  of  the  amygdala  (BL)  is  thought  to  support  numerous  emotional  behaviors  through specific microcircuits.-->

###### Afferents {#BLAinputs}

Multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA (for a more comprehensive review, see: @pape_2010, @sah_2003). 
It is carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory, associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala *via* the external or internal capsules (for reviews: @hjos_2021; @sah_2003). <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review? // thalamic nuclei and secondary or higher-order sensory cortices besides the associative cortices-->
In most cases, those afferents project to both principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons.

A large body of evidence highlights the role of these terminals in the acquisition of fear conditioning [@blanchard_1972; @ledoux_1990]. 
At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA<!--, especially its lateral part,--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS (e.g., terminals from the auditory thalamus and cortex) and a strong input carrying US information (e.g., footshock).
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, @nabavi_2014). 
Accordingly, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon. 

Analogous to fear conditioning, reward-induced conditioning responses<!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues--> are also associated with a synaptic potentiation in the BLA, leading to a cue-triggered behavior [@clem_2010; @johansen_2010; @tye_2008].<!-- nowsze cytowania  -->
These findings further support the notion that both learning about danger and potential rewards is adaptive and engages the amygdala [@janak_2015].
Moreover, increasing evidence shows that distinct subpopulations of BLA differentially encode valence.
Accordingly, optogenetic studies delineated that the BLA-NAc pathway is preferentially excited by appetitive stimuli, whereas BLA-CeA connections are preferentially activated by aversive ones [@beyeler_2016; @namburi_2015; @pignatelli_2019]. 

In addition to pyramidal-like neurons, local interneurons also receive, to some extend, inputs from cortical and thalamic afferents [@smith_2000; @woodson_2000]. 
For example, CB-expressing interneurons receive about a half of the cortical inputs [@unal_2014], whereas thalamic neurons project to less than 1% of BLA interneurons [@szinyei_2000].

The glutamate and GABA transmission within the BLA is strongly modulated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig. <!--figure-->).
Specifically, this region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2) serotonergic projections originating from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), (3) dense dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN), and (4) projections from the basal forebrain (@prager_2016 and references therein). 


###### Intrinsic connectivity {#BLAinside}

As described above, computations performed by BLA circuits to control emotional responses are heavily influenced by a myriad of inputs conveying both sensory and cognitive information.
The subsequent generation of emotional responses by the  BLA  is largely determined by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to  BLA principal cells which are tightly controlled by GABAergic interneurons [@bocchio_2016; @capogna_2014; @hjos_2021; @spampanato_2011].
Thus, here, I briefly discuss our current understanding of the connectivity of this complex neuronal network.

Principal cells are densely interconnected between subdivisions of the BLA complex by sending long-distance collaterals [@sah_2003; @smith_2000].
PCs from the lateral part send many projections onto their counterparts in the basal nuclei (B) [@duvarci_2014; @krettek_1978; @pitknen_1997], displaying preferential lateromedial<!-- to nie ma sensu--> directionality of those connections.
In addition, principal cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons [@szinyei_2000].
These synapses have peculiar characteristics, including no NMDA receptors [@mahanty_1998] or AMPA receptors with low GluR2 subunit in the postsynaptic membrane [@mahanty_1998], resulting in strong inward rectification and calcium permeability [@washburn_1997].<!-- lepiej napisać functional relevance of these properties?????? -->

BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their primary source of GABAergic inputs [@bienvenu_2012; @muller_2006; @rainnie_2006; @woodruff_2007a].
It is widely accepted that the anatomical location of the GABAergic synapses on the postsynaptic cell largely determines the functional impact of the interneuronal activity on the target neuron (for a review: @tremblay_2016).
Consistent with this notion, several microscopic analyses confirm that <!--in addition to their dendritic and somatic differences in morphology-->BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies, including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons [@mcdonald_2001; @muller_2003; @muller_2005; @muller_2006; @muller_2007].
For example, principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA <!-- sprawdzić and  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses.
Moreover, distinct subtypes of interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target of PCs.
Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; @mcdonald_2001, @muller_2005, @muller_2006). 
Moreover, PV-expressing neurons can be further grouped into chandelier cells that were demonstrated to primarily innervate the AIS of principal cells [@bienvenu_2012] and basket cells, which form a continuum, varying proportions of perisomatic and distal dendritic synapses with principal neurons [@veres_2014].
Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs' spiking output and timing [@woodruff_2006].
On the other hand, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons [@muller_2007].
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials<!-- directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in -->, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: @tremblay_2016). 

Similar to excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines. 
Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA.
However, the regulation of the BLA network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by @prager_2016. 
Nonetheless, it should be briefly noted that neuromodulators and their receptors are distributed differently within different cell subtypes in the amygdala, inducing a broad range of electrophysiological effects, adding another level of complexity to the BLA network. 
For example, DA selectively inhibited the GABA release from PV-immunopositive interneurons to principal cells, but not to other cell types, by acting *via* D2 receptors [@chu_2012]. 
This target-specific modulation results in the disinhibition of principal cells, whereas inhibitory inputs remain unaltered.
Moreover, at the network level, DA was revealed to reduce the inhibitory tone in the BLA, facilitating the induction of LTP at sensory afferents [@bissire_2003] and the formation of fear memories [@fadok_2009].

In addition to their strong regulation of PCs' activity, BLA interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron contacts.
Electron microscopy analyses revealed that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being mediated by gap junctions [@muller_2005].
While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among  BLA interneurons remains high, but mainly within the same subtype [@muller_2005; @woodruff_2007a].
This notion was further supported by a study using a conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical synapses  [@andrsi_2017].

Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors.
In general, activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA~A~-receptor-dependent, and slow, GABA~B~-receptor-dependent components [@washburn_1992].
Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory components originate from<!-- are due to activity of?--> distinct subpopulations of interneurons [@sugita_1992]. 
Furthermore, in contrast to most other cells, the slow component of the inhibitory synaptic potential in BLA pyramidal neurons is in part generated by a calcium-activated potassium conductance activated by calcium influx *via* NMDA receptors [@danober_1998; @lang_1997].
These findings suggest that NMDA receptors might be coupled to calcium-activated potassium channels, at least in the lateral amygdala. 

The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties <!-- expression of neuromodulators? -->contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations and flow of information. 
These are often thought to be comprised of feedback inhibition [@smith_2000; @unal_2014], feedforward inhibition [@bazelot_2015; @lang_1997; @popescu_2011], and disinhibition [@bienvenu_2015] (for a comprehensive review: @tremblay_2016; @woodruff_2007).
Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA. 
Indeed, accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA [@bauer_2007; @klenowski_2015; @mcdonald_2004; @pelletier_2004].
Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections, thereby modulating several behavioral responses [@bauer_2007; @bienvenu_2012; @courtin_2014; @davis_2017; @zheng_2017].

###### Efferents {#BLAoutputs}

Besides being the main input of the amygdaloid complex, the BLA is also reported to send some projections, regulating multiple behaviors and emotions (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @par_2002; @sah_2003).
Among many sensory inputs mentioned in the previous section (see: \@ref(BLAinputs)), the prefrontal cortex (PFC, especially its medial part) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) have strong reciprocal connections with the BLA complex [@sah_2003]. 
In contrast, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the CeA.

Although a great majority of excitatory BLA projections<!--along with most of BLA interneurons form local synapses-->, there is a small fraction of long-range inhibitory interneurons, targeting the entorhinal cortex [@mcdonald_2015] or the basal forebrain [@mcdonald_2012] as well as mPFC and periaqueductal grey (PAG) [@sun_2019]. 

Over the last decade, multiple optogenetic experiments have identified<!--dissect?--> the functional role of BLA projections to cortical and striatal regions, translating BLA signals to behavioral output.
Specifically, it was shown that activation of both BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`vHPC and BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`mPFC projections increased anxiety and reduced social interactions, whereas their inhibition induced anxiolytic effects and facilitated social interactions [@felixortiz_2013; @felixortiz_2014; @felixortiz_2016].
Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`CeA pathway was also shown to regulate anxiety in the same manner as BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`vHPC and BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`mPFC projections [@tye_2011].

The BLA complex is also a key part of neural circuits involved in the regulation of valence-related behavior. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that divergent subpopulations of the BLA neurons differentially encode fearful or rewarding associations (for example: @kyriazi_2018). 
Consistent with this notion, BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or CeA were reported to undergo opposing synaptic changes during conditioned appetitive and aversive emotional responses [@namburi_2015]. 
Specifically, BLA neurons projecting to NAc were reported to respond preferentially to reward-predictive cues [@beyeler_2016].
Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of those neurons was documented to facilitate reward-seeking behavior<!--and is mediated by intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signaling-->, whereas optical inhibition of the BLA terminals in NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose [@namburi_2015; @stuber_2011].
Conversely, BLA neurons targeting the CeM were preferentially excited to a stimulus predicting an aversive outcome [@beyeler_2016].
Consistently, optical stimulation of BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`CeM pathway increased fear conditioning and decreased reward learning, whereas photoinhibition of those neurons impaired fear conditioning and enhanced reward conditioning [@namburi_2015]. 
Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that valence could be decoded from the neural activity at the population level [@kyriazi_2018].
Thus, we are beginning to unravel how a single brain region can encode such opposite behaviors, which is of high relevance and warrants further investigation.

Notably, other critical components of amygdala fear circuits and BLA outputs are the intercalated cells (ITCs), GABAergic neurons surrounding the BLA. 

#### Intercalated cell masses {#ITCs}

Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the BLA. <!-- figure --><!-- citations -->
Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into (1)  lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITC~L~),  bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITC~MP~, localized within the intermediate<!--internal?--> capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA,<!--medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) --> and  (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITC~VM~) [@mako_2011; @millhouse_1986].<!-- figure-->

Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (10–15 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle [@mcdonald_1993; @nitecka_1987],  and larger (>50 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices [@bienvenu_2015]. 
Moreover, ITCs express the highest density of `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala [@jacobsen_2006; @marowsky_2005; @palomarescastillo_2012; @pape_2010], indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.
Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (mGluR1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`), GABA~A~ receptors `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`1 subunit, and PV [@bienvenu_2015].
Electrophysiologically, both types of cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance,  higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA interneurons.  [@busti_2011; @geracitano_2007; @mako_2011; @royer_2000]. 
Their high intrinsic firing frequency could be explained by their expression of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) after an action potential, reflecting slowly-inactivating potassium currents (I~SD~) [@royer_2000]. <!-- zmienić -->

In addition, increasing evidence points to some functional diversity<!--heterogeneity--> within and between ITC clusters.
For example, neurons of the ITC~MP~ cluster showed a stronger pattern of neuronal activation compared with other ITC clusters following<!--regarding--> fear-conditioning [@hagihara_2021; @hefner_2008], whereas the activation of ITC~VM~ neurons is more robust after extinction and extinction retrieval [@busti_2011; @hagihara_2021; @likhtik_2008].
Interestingly, dopamine, a crucial neuromodulator of neuronal activity within the amygdala complex, selectively hyperpolarizes and depresses the excitability of interneurons in ITC~MP~ and ITC~L~ clusters.
In contrast, other interneurons of the amygdala showed increased excitability after DA application, resulting in a disinhibition of the BLA and CeA nuclei [@marowsky_2005].

This functional heterogeneity between ITCs clusters may be in part dependent on their connectivity.
ITC~L~ interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs [@strobel_2015], thereby providing feedforward inhibition to BLA principal neurons [@marowsky_2005].<!-- sprawdzić ostatnie cytowanie lITC neurons receive auditory input from cortical and thalamic regions. [@strobel_2015] ///-->
On the other hand, auditory input to ITC~MP~ neurons is stronger from the thalamus and weaker from the cortex [@strobel_2015], and it was shown to undergo fear conditioning-related changes mediated by presynaptic GABA~B~ receptors [@asede_2015].
ITC neurons receive projections from BLA and mainly target more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an inhibitory interface<!--gate--> between the BLA and CeA [@busti_2011; @marowsky_2005; @royer_2000]. 
Interestingly, within this cluster, some neurons are mutually activated by BLA principal neurons and inhibited by other ITC cells [@asede_2015].
In addition, ITC~PM~ neurons were suggested to directly inhibit the ITC~VM~ cluster, resulting in disinhibition of the CeA and, thus, facilitation of fear responses [@busti_2011; @royer_2000].
These findings illustrate that intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each cluster but also between clusters.
Hence, intercalated cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially by gating CeA output.

#### Central amygdala {#CeAstructure}

The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions [@jolkkonen_1998; @mcdonald_1982a; @sah_2003].
Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL [@duvarci_2014].
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense intra-connectivity (@krettek_1978 and for a review: @fox_2015, @gilpin_2015, @sah_2003). 
However, here we focus mainly on the CeA. 

##### Neuronal composition

Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016]. <!-- nie wiem czy dobre cytowania-->
Neurons within this nucleus are a diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and *in vivo* patterns of activity.<!-- figure /// with different functional and molecular features. //  -->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons [@mcdonald_1993; @sun_1993], further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA [@medina_2004; @waclaw_2010]. 
More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (e.i., a small soma and numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low density of dendritic spines [@cassell_1989; @mcdonald_1982a]. <!--zobaczyć różnice między CeL i CeM....-->
Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, mediated by K~v1~-dependent slowly inactivated D-type K^+^ currents [@hou_2016], and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive firing spikes [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004].
Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.<!-- CeL or CeA in general? -->
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells [@martina_1999]. <!-- figure-->
Fast-spiking cells are characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency (>40 Hz) with no accommodation [@dumont_2002], as their counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA. 
Moreover, their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with > 1 ms in other cell types in CeA [@dumont_2002]. <!-- citations? -->
The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed with T-type calcium channels.
These channels are thought to contribute to characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to depolarizing current pulses, whereas those neurons generate rebound spikes when hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied [@dumont_2002; @hou_2016]. 

Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including SOM, protein kinase C`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` (PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin (ENK), and others [@cassell_1989; @haubensak_2010]. 
Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive. 
Here, I will briefly describe the emerging subpopulations based on the expression of immunohistochemical markers, together with their electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections.

PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons, which are mainly localized in the CeL and CeC subdivision of the CeA, form a relatively homogeneous group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`85%; @haubensak_2010). 
The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons [@haubensak_2010].
Functionally, following fear-conditioning, these neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> and thus are often referred to as CeL~OFF~ cells [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010]. 
Moreover, almost half of the PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` neurons co-express ENK or OR, which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM [@haubensak_2010; @huber_2005; @viviani_2011]. 

On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` marker express SOM [@haubensak_2010; @li_2013a].
Those cells display heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining 40% are classified as LF [@li_2013a]. 
Moreover, during fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear memory [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013a].
Importantly, sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice [@li_2013a].
Therefore, they have often been termed CeL~ON~ neurons. 
Despite one study demonstrating SOM- and CRF-containing neurons as two different neuronal populations mediating distinct behavioral outcomes [@fadok_2017], many other findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF [@mccullough_2018; @pomrenze_2015]. 
Accordingly, as PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` and CRF- or SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional roles. 

##### Connectivity

Although there was a prevailing notion that the CeA is a passive gateway conveying information from the BLA to downstream fear effectors, mounting evidence illustrates that this structure is an active participant not only in fear conditioning but also in distinct behavioral phenotypes. 

###### Afferents

As mentioned previously, the BLA predominantly projects to the CeA. 
In particular, while the lateral part of the BLA preferentially projects to CeL, CeM neurons receive more substantial inputs from the basal nucleus [@duvarci_2014; @krettek_1978]. 
The CeA can be innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto CeA neurons (@krettek_1978, @lopezdearmentia_2004 or indirectly *via* GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward inhibition [@jngling_2008; @royer_1999].
Considering excitatory inputs, besides typical AMPA and NMDA receptors<!--neurons in both the CeM and CeL receive glutamatergic inputs from the lateral and basal nucleus which activate both AMPA and NMDA receptors  [(Royer and M de A 2004)]].-->, presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors are present at excitatory inputs to CeL neurons [@neugebauer_2000], leading to the depression of the synaptic input. 
This effect was reported to be modulated following kindling and chronic cocaine treatment [@neugebauer_2000].
Thus, it is possible that alterations in the synaptic efficacy at inputs targeting the CeA may be involved in the changes related to epilepsy or drug addiction. 
Nevertheless, the best-documented role of those excitatory inputs is their involvement in fear learning and expression. 
For example, fear conditioning was reported to strengthen the excitatory synapses from the BLA onto both SOM- and CRF-containing cells in the CeL [@fadok_2017; @li_2013a]. 
In line with these findings, the study conducted by @tye_2011 nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals<!-- or cell body --> in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals was linked to a high-anxiety behavioral phenotype.
Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feedforward inhibition of the CeM [@ciocchi_2010; @tye_2011]. 

On the other hand, intercalated cells, which were shown to also play a crucial role in fear-conditioning, form GABAergic synapses on CeL neurons (see Section \@ref(ITCs)).
Notably, it was shown that the composition of GABA receptors in those synapses differs depending on their subcellular target [@delaney_2001]. 
Specifically, CeL soma receives synapses containing only GABA~A~ receptors, whereas additional GABA~C-like~ receptors, similar to bicuculline-insensitive retinal GABA~C~ receptors, have been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses formed by intercalated cells onto dendrites of CeL neurons [@delaney_2001].
These results indicate that different compositions of GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of this region. 

Additionally, not only inputs from the BLA and ITCs are involved in fear-conditioning.
CeL receives direct projections outside the amygdala, which are also crucial in this regard.
For instance, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a region activated by physical and psychological stressors<!-- stress sensor 1-3-->, was demonstrated to send projections to the CeL,  preferentially innervating SOM-containing neurons [@domonte_2015; @penzo_2015]. 
Stimulation of those afferents resulted in the facilitation of the activity of SOM neurons, leading to the inhibition of CeL [@domonte_2015; @penzo_2015], which is critical for fear-conditioning and expression [@domonte_2015; @penzo_2015]. 
Similarly, oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus, another brain region innervating CeL, were illustrated to send their axon terminals onto CeL neurons [@knobloch_2012].
Activation of those projections led to the release of oxytocin onto CeL neurons, the increase in their excitability, and hence the attenuation of the freezing behavior [@knobloch_2012]. <!--it leads to attenuation of freezing behavior ///  poprawić this is especially the case for.. -->
Yet another source of projections to the CeA, which are crucial for anxiety regulation, is the BNST, innervating stronger medial than lateral subdivision [@gungor_2015]. 

Furthermore, CeL, especially its PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons, was revealed to be involved in feeding behavior.<!-- sending anorexigenic signals. // regulating -->
For example, stimulation of axons from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) directly projecting to CeL was reported to suppress the appetite [@carter_2013].
In line with this result, optogenetic excitation of PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice [@cai_2014].
Conversely, in mice, reducing the activity of PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-immunopositive cells in CeL was shown to reverse the effects of decreased feeding induced by sickness or unpalatable tastes [@cai_2014]. <!-- [@janak_2015] was found to block decreased feeding stimulated by sickness or unpalatable tastes-->
Hence, these findings indicate that CeL, especially the PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`  subpopulation, is activated by anorexigenic signals.  

The CeA also receives noxious stimulus information *via* processed input from the BLA and direct projections from the spino-parabrachial-amygdaloid pathway [@braz_2005]. 
In this regard, especially important seems capsular part of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeC), called "nociceptive amygdala", due to its projections from the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB; a critical target of dorsal horn afferents; for example: @dong_2010), along with the well-demonstrated potentiation of synaptic transmission between those areas in many pain models (for example @cheng_2011 or @ikeda_2007). 

<!-- We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).-->

###### Intrinsic connectivity 

Over the last decade, the conjunction of optogenetics and electrophysiological approaches not only has further supported the prevailing notion that CeL neurons send mainly unidirectional afferents to CeM [@haubensak_2010; @jolkkonen_1998; @li_2013a; @petrovich_1997] but also has illustrated the complexity and extent of CeL intraconnectivity (i.e., within the network) and interconnectivity (i.e., between networks). 
Generally, the  CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features [@cassell_1989; @ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013a; @lopezdearmentia_2004; @martina_1999]. 
CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes. <!-- zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. --> 
For example, synapses formed between LF`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`RS and RS`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`LF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class [@hou_2016]. 
Similarly, CRF-expressing neurons provide inhibitory input to both SOM- and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-immunopositive neurons in the CeL [@fadok_2017; @pomrenze_2015], whereas connections between the same subtype are less frequent [@partridge_2016]. 
In addition to its GABA~A~-receptor-dependent synaptic modulation, CRF was also shown to increase excitatory synaptic transmission *via* its receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2 [@ji_2013; @pomrenze_2015; @silberman_2013].<!--Moreover, a more recent study has documented that CRF-expressing neurons undergo plasticity following fear-conditioning and that CRF1-dependent mechanisms are critical for proper discrimination of threat-predictive cues (Sanford et  al., 2017).--> 

It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal activity of the CeL is required for the fear acquisition, whereas activity in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses [@ciocchi_2010].
Moreover, CeM activation alone is well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing [@ledoux_1988].
This effect can be mimicked by CeL inactivation, indicating that CeL neurons tonically inhibit CeM output  [@ciocchi_2010; @gozzi_2010].
Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing cells than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable projections to the CeM [@li_2013a].
In contrast, the PKC-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons [@haubensak_2010; @li_2013a].
Hence, during the presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically inhibited by CeL~ON~, SOM-immunopositive neurons [@gozzi_2010], leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction of freezing.<!-- dobrze wytłumaczone w Penzo 2014  --> 
However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced, PK`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing CeL projection neurons become active, inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output. <!-- Therefore, the balance between activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations results in two  /// Therefore, these two parallel CeA outputs have been shown to control behavioral output balanced between passive freezing (*via* CeM output to the brainstem) and active exploration (*via* CeL-mediated disinhibition of cortical neurons). -->
Therefore, the balance between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly impacts the behavioral output of this region.

###### Efferents 

While there is a general acceptance that the CeM is the major output nucleus of the amygdala playing a pivotal role in mediating behavioral and physiologic responses to emotionally relevant events *via* its inhibitory projections to downstream targets, some data indicate that the CeL also sends GABAergic projections to behaviorally and physiologically relevant regions. <!-- These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to the CeL–CeM pathway, additional channels exist for CeL to participate in fear processing.-->
Accumulating studies have illustrated that distinct neuronal subpopulations in CeM project to different brainstem sites. 
Specifically, CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), a region important for autonomic regulation, receive inputs from those CeL neurons, which lack oxytocin receptors, whereas CeL neurons expressing oxytocin receptors target CeM cells projecting to PAG [@viviani_2011]. 

PAG, together with PVT, are also implicated in mediating defensive behavior [@penzo_2014]. 
Accordingly, these regions were shown to be directly inhibited by another subpopulation of CeL neurons, SOM-immunopositive neurons [@penzo_2014].
Thus, these data further support that the CeL also sends long-range projections to innervate regions outside the amygdala complex. 
Moreover, both CeM and CeL neurons, especially those expressing CRF, send substantial projections to the BNST, affecting fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing [@asok_2018].
These subpopulations also send afferents to locus coeruleus (LC), and their activation was sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavior [@paretkar_2018]. 
Additionally, CRF-expressing neurons were shown to project to the SN, the VTA, and the LH [@pomrenze_2015; @reyes_2011; @tsumori_2006], regions mediating brain reward function.
Furthermore, CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC, which stimulation was shown to modulate reward-related behaviors [@seo_2016]. 
Similarly, CeL also contains populations of projections neurons, some of which control cortical activity *via* basal cholinergic neurons and shift fear responses from freezing behavior toward an active escape [@gozzi_2010]. 
Hence, besides strong neuromodulatory innervation of the whole amygdala, this region can also indirectly influence the excitability of neuromodulatory cell groups releasing Ach, NE, DA located in the basal forebrain and brainstem.

In addition to its well-known role in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the pain pathway.
Interestingly, activation of ENK-containing neurons in CeL and CeC resulted in an increased c-Fos expression in PAG and reduced anxiety-like behavior and analgesia in both uninjured mice and mice with neuropathic pain [@paretkar_2019].
This evidence strongly suggests the role of ENK-expressing neurons in regulating both nociception and emotion.

Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enable to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- bardziej zmienić -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and origin. <!-- bardziej zmienić // ładne podsumowanie-->

### Summary 

Taken together, each nucleus receives a unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
The complex pattern of connections along with the balance of activity between them represents a mosaic set of regulatory motifs that orchestrates a distributed neural parallel circuitries. 
All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and homeostatic control.
Considering this diversity, it is not surprising that the disruption of the amygdala functioning is associated with many disorders, including alcoholism and other reward-related disorders<!-- citations -->, anxiety<!-- citations-->, PTSD<!-- citations -->, and stress-related disorders<!-- citations-->, autism<!--citations-->, obesity<!-- citations-->, epilepsy<!--citations-->, pain<!--citations-->, just to list a few.  <!-- , just to list a few (LeDoux, 2000; Phelps et al., 2014) -->
Thus, the amygdala functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant sensory information about the external and internal environment into behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in homeostasis.
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution [@jarvis_2005], better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.

## Chemokines action in the amygdala

Amygdala is strategically positioned to regulate homeostatic function, and thus, one may speculate that it would be involved in integrating signals from endocrine and immune systems. <!-- jakieś lepsze intro... As being strategically positioned to be a hub, amygdala together with playing homeostatic function, one may speculate that i że several evidence i wymienić od 1 2 3-->
It is supported by several lines of evidence. <!-- review how immune system sub the brain -->
First, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages CeA and, to a lesser extent, the BLA [@engler_2011; @frenois_2007; @harrison_2009]. 
Peripheral signal of immune activation is thought to be mediated either *via*  activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting by proinflammatory cytokines and/or glucocorticoids to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to the amygdala, predominantly its central part (for a review: @vitkovic_2000; @critchley_2013).
Alternatively, this signal activates the HPA axis, which is also connected with the amygdala [@diiorio_2017; @green_2007; @herman_2005]. 
Moreover, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: @yang_2016). 

Second, mounting evidence illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part. 
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders [@girgenti_2017; @tovote_2015; @yang_2016], epilepsy [@fabene_2010; @roseti_2013; @suleymanova_2021; @tian_2017], obesity [@guillemotlegris_2017; @kawamura_2021], pain [@mlikparsadaniantz_2015; @old_2012; @paretkar_2019; @yuan_2020], drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; @coller_2012, @freeman_2012, @jacobsen_2016; @wang_2012).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.

Third, many recent studies demonstrating glial involvement in behavior, including the amygdala [@althammer_2020; @martinfernandez_2017]. 
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors. 

Finally, several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@nishiyori_1998; @tarozzo_2003]<!-- dodać CXCR4, CXCR7 CYTOWANIA-->, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala. 
Surprisingly, despite many similarities between amygdala network and chemokine system dysfunctions, the electrophysiological role of chemokines in this structure is still unclear.<!--  -->
