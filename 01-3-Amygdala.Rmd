## Amygdala  {#amygdalamain}     

The amygdala, a complex comprised of heterogenous collection of nuclei, is located in the medial temporal lobe. 
Its nulei can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: @duvarci_2014).
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this structure, there is no <!--anatomical--> standardization of amygdaloid nuclei terminology. <!-- although there is no standardization in relation to correct term, -->
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes <!--synonym-->the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) [@mcdonald_1998; @sah_2003].
However, here the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, as it was presented in many excellent papers focusing on these domains due to their contribution in fear-conditioning (@bocchio_2016; @duvarci_2014; @ehrlich_2009; @pape_2010; @spampanato_2011, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalastr)).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere [@pitknen_1997; @sah_2003]. <!--check citations and more? -->

### Functions {#amygdalafunctions}

This limbic region is involved in very distinct behaviors related with learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction [@ehrlich_2009; @herry_2010; @ledoux_2000; @roozendaal_2009].<!-- Accumulating evidence indicate that amygdala is involved in. wcześniej: mood regulation, fear-conditioning/associative learning, and modulation of cognitive functions-->
At first glimpse, this variety of functions could be surprising, but most of them are related<!--inne słówko // reduced?--> to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning and its malfunctions. 
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events, so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie --><!-- plus dodać tutaj o modelu? -->
This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning. 
For example, during fear conditioning, an neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior [@janak_2015; @ledoux_2000].
Therefore, amygdala has been conserved throughout evolution and even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals [@janak_2015]. 
Amygdala is also an important player in tuning autonomic responses to homeostatic challenges, including those of the peripheral immune system [@pachecolpez_2005]. <!--więcej cytowań / lepiej napisać-->
Recent technological advances and approaches, including optogenetic and pharmacogenetic, in conjunction with genetic targeting of specified cells, battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, enable to determine how neuronal activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes.
Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have<!--inne słówko--> widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @pape_2010; @sah_2003), further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. <!-- figure ? illustrating amygdala as a hub?-->
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the role, anatomy, and physiology of this fascinating and complex brain structure. <!-- brzydkie zdanie napisać jakoś lepiej.... /// This has led to new insights into behavioral functions of amygdala neuronal activity, revealing a complex picture of amygdalar control of behavior. // The fear circuitry orchestrates defense mechanisms in response to environmental threats. This circuitry is evolutionarily crucial for survival, but its dysregulation is thought to play a major role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions in humans.-->

### Structure and Connectivity {#amygdalastructure}
<!-- Anatomy and Physiology? // As a group, amygdala nuclei receive inputs from and project to virtually all levels of the central nervous system. -->
#### The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) {#BLAstructure}

The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter is also known as accessory basal nucleus (@krettek_1978, see Fig. \@ref:fig(amygdalastr)). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
All these nuclei are often referred as the basolateral nucleus (BLA) and hereafter this term will be used.<!-- In order to avoid misunderstanding, I will refer to the basolateral complex as BLA and basal/basolateral nucleus as B. -->
The BLA is considered to be the main point of the entry for cortical and thalamic sensory inputs into the amygdala, which form axonal bundles and enter *via* external and internal capsule, respectively (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @lalumiere_2014; @sah_2003a). <!-- The cortical and thalamic inputs form axonal bundles and enter intothe BLA via external capsule and internal capsule, respectively  -->
This complex developmentally and structurally is a cortical-like structure [@waclaw_2010], although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization [@sah_2003].
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons [@duvarci_2014; @mcdonald_1993; @spampanato_2011]. 

##### Neuronal Composition {#BLAcells}
<!-- choć może cellular i tutaj też astrocyty? -->

###### Principal cells {#PC} {#BLAPC}

Principal cells (PC) show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal pyramidal counterparts. <!-- such as a low input resistance? low excitability, not sponteneously active,  presence of prominent apical dendrite (McDonald 1982).-->

In the BLA, PCs represents rather heterogeneous group, forming subpopulations based on both morphological and electrophysiological features [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000].
Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite [@mcdonald_1982].<!--  see figure? --><!-- (McDonald 1982, 1984, 1992). ///  Our data also show that principal cell dendrite spine density increased at distal regions compared with proximal regions [@klenowski_2015]-->
<!-- Reflecting ..?? Based on their morphological profile, -->Reflecting the morphological heterogeneity of PCs population, these cells may vary in soma volume [@klenowski_2015] and/or shape (triangle vs. stellate-like morphology) as well as a shape of dendritic trees [@faber_2001, @par_1995; @klenowski_2015]. 
Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections [@faber_2001; @par_1995].
The degree of this adaptation forms an continuum. <!-- the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms an continuum: -->
At one end cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas at the other end their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- może jakiś figure i trochę lepiej napisać? see Fig. in methods?-->
Moreover, more prominent spike frequency adaptation was associated with more prominent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and higher expression of calcium-activated potassium channels in those cells [@faber_2001; @faber_2002; @sah_1996]. <!-- HERE: additional electrophysiological features of principal cells /// Additionally, another electrophysiological characteristics of principal neurons in BLA are: relatively wide  action potentials (half-width = 1.2 ms), ....., .....-->
Additionally, a small subset of PCs display bursting activity which is thought to be due to the presence of low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current [@par_1995]. <!-- ładniej napisać, wcześniej Interestingly, some of them display bursting activity or a delay in firing when depolarized from more negative membrane potentials, which is thought to be due to the presence .// consistent with the reported persistent lack of expression of the KCC2 transporter in hippocampal Cajal-Retzius cells -->
However, it is not clear to what extent these differences in firing pattern are reflective of distinct principal cells' subpopulations and what their functional significance might be. <!-- może zmienić trochę bardziej? -->
Moreover, morphological and electrophysiological features of PCs seem not to be inter-correlated [@faber_2001; @funahashi_2000]. <!-- nie wiem czy to nie gdzieś indziej albo wywalić -->

###### Interneurons {#BLAinter}

In contrast to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002; @mcdonald_2004]. <!-- BLA interneurons generally have smaller cell bodies compared with principal cells, lack spines, and have no apparent apical dendrite (McDonald 1982).-->
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and  chandelier cells [@mcdonald_1982; @woodruff_2010]. 
Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, dendrites of some interneurons show a more  spine-sparse morphology [@klenowski_2015]. <!-- After we divided our interneuron data set into spiny and aspiny interneurons on this basis, examination of these subgroups did not reveal any significant morphological differences, nor did we find any obvious localization patterns, as each BLA subnucleus we sampled from contained both spiny and aspiny interneurons (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we found that interneurons classified as spiny had similar proximal and distal spine densities compared with principal cell basal dendrites. This finding is noteworthy, as previous studies have suggested that BLA interneurons are generally spine sparse or aspiny (McDonald 1982; Sah et al. 2003; Washburn and Moises 1992).@klenowski_2015-->
It should be also noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons<!-- see below -->. <!--  GABAergic interneuron axons branch, on average, two to six times, forming relatively dense terminal and collateral fields with principal neurons (Millhouse and DeOlmos, 1983; Smith et al., 1998). axonal morphology of BLA GABAergic interneurons also allows for tight inhibitory control over principal neurons.  PRAGER_2016-->

Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons [@kemppainen_2000; @mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2001a; @mcdonald_2002; @muller_2003]. <!-- (Mascagni & McDonald, 2003) może zrobić figure? --> <!-- In the BLA, PV-expressing neurons  represent the largest interneuronal population (40%),  whereas CR-immunopositive interneurons constitute about 25–30% of BLA GABAergic cells (for reviews: @spampanato_2011, @capogna_2014, @pager_2016).the main two non-overlapping groups are those expressing calbindin (CB+) and calretinin (CR+) representing around 50% and 20% of all interneurons in the BLA, respectively [@mcdonald_2001; @mcdonald_2002]. Each of these groups can be further sub-divided based on their expression of somatostatin (SOM+), vasoactive intestinal peptide  (VIP+), cholecystokinin (CCK+), and parvalbumin (PV+) (for a review, see: @spampanato_2011). /// For example, interneurons expressing calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV), which constitute ~ 50% of the cell population [@mcdonald_2001a; @rainnie_2006] można by było zrobić  różnymi kolorami interneurony w BLA i CeA ale nie wiem czy nie za dużo pracy... -->
<!-- non-overlapping groups, in rodent, but not in humans, so SOM and PV alone are better predictors? indicators? charactizators?  suggesting that sole PV or SOM could be a useful markers to differentiate between interneuronal population -->
It should be noted that these subpopulations can be further subdivided. 
For instance, there is a subpopulation of SOM+ neurons, which expresses neuropeptide Y (NPY; <!-- (McDonald, 1989).)-->, whereas the PV group includes the basket and chandelier cells, also known as axo-axonic neurons (AAC), which will be discussed in the next section <!--(see: /@ref(), for reviews: )-->. <!-- PV+ basket cells (PVBCs) also express CB,  whereas PV+ AACs do not -->
Moreover, the relative ratios of interneuron types may differ between brain regions.
Within the BLA, they are roughly the same, except for PV-immunopositive interneurons.
As mentioned above, this subpopulation constitute around 40% of interneurons in BLA, specifically in the basal nucleus, whereas in the lateral accounts for only 20% of this cell subtype. 

Regarding the electrophysiological profile of BLA interneurons, contrary to principal cells, they show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously *in vivo* at high frequencies (10-15 Hz)  [@spampanato_2011; @pare_1995]. <!-- figure? Most BLA GABAergic interneurons fire short-duration action potentials  with  small  spike  frequency  adaptation  in response to prolonged depolarization, although specific subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons have different firing patterns (see Table I).-->
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons [@petillainterneuronnomenclaturegroup_2008], but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004]. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns [@spampanato_2011]. <!--more recent reviews--><!--, a consequence of the interplay of membrane properties and ion channel composition defining the passive and active membrane biophysical properties among interneuronal subtypes (for a comprehensive review, see: @tremblay_2016).--><!-- ZMIENIĆ DRUGĄ CZĘŚĆ ZDANIA I CYTOWANIE I SKĄD TO!!!!  figure ? //previously  a  at least six distinct types of firing properties [@jasnow_2009; @mahanty_1998; @sosulina_2010; @woodruff_2007]. // specific subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons have different firing patterns  // Electrophysiologically, a plethora of firing patterns have been observed,a consequence of the interplay of membrane cable properties and ion channel composition defining the passive and active membrane biophysical properties among IN subtypes ( Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Markram et al., 2004 ).-->
<!-- FOR EXAMPLE PV+ cells, 6 distinct, sticity.Rainnie et al. (2006)found that PV INs in the rat BL exhibited burst-firing or stutter-firing in response to transientdepolari zing current injection. Both subpopulations of PV INs included PVBCs (Fig. 5C–E).     PV+ stutter-firing neuronsfired high-frequency spike trains that were interrupted by short periods of quiescence. PV+ burst-firing neurons fired repetitive bursts of high-frequency discharges, followed by a regular pattern of firing. The same patterns of highfrequency firing are also seen in cortical PV INs (Buhl et al., 1994;Kawaguchi, 1995;Pawelzik, Hughes, &Thomson , 2002) where they appear to be due to the expression of Kv3.1b and Kv3.2 potassium channel subunits(Toledo-Rodriguez et al., 2004). Not surprisingly, it was found that about 95% of PV INs in the BNC wereKv3.1b + and 75% were Kv3.2+ (McDonald & Mascagni, 2006). -->
Although some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells [@rainnie_2006; @woodruff_2007], whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation [@jasnow_2009], the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear. <!-- begun to elucidate a link between distinct electrophysiological profile and neurochemical markers // once again which of these versions is correct?! For example, four electrophysiologically separable types of cells were found to express PV in combination with either CCK or CB [@sosulina_2010]. -->
However, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and may modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: @spampanato_2011, @tremblay_2016). 
<!-- + KANAŁYYYYYYYYYY -->

##### Connectivity {#BLAconnectivity}

<!-- zdanie wprowadzające? coś w deseń, że amygdala ogarnia wiele funkcji, więc parallel microcircuits, complex connectivity // The  basolateral  nucleus  of  the  amygdala  (BL)  is  thought  to  support  numerous  emotional  behaviors  through specific microcircuits.--><!-- Most of the knowledge of the extrinsic connectivity of the BLA arises from tracer
experiments in rats, although cats and monkeys have also been extensively studied. In all
three species, these investigations have revealed that the BLA receives a wide variety of
extrinsic inputs, which include sensory cortex and thalamus, medial temporal lobe structures
involved in memory processes, the hypothalamus and subcortical neuromodulatory systems
located in the midbrain and in the basal forebrain (Pitkänen, 2000; Sah et al., 2003). This
suggests that the computation performed by BLA circuits to control defensive (and other
emotional) responses is heavily influenced by a myriad of inputs conveying both sensory and
cognitive information.-->

###### Afferents {#BLAinputs}

Multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converge in the BLA (for a more comprehensive review, see: @pape_2010, @sah_2003). 
It is carried by afferents from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory,associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala *via* the external or internal capsules (for reviews: @hjos_2021; @sah_2003). <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review? // thalamic nuclei and secondary or higher-order sensory cortices besides the associative cortices-->
In most cases, afferents from these regions project to both principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons.

A large body of evidence highlight the role of these afferents in the acquisition of fear conditioning [@blanchard_1972; @ledoux_1990]. <!-- Considerable work indicates that long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses transmitting CS information to the BLA underlies fear conditioning conditioning. That is, the ability of the once neutral CS to generate defensive behavior is mediated by an LTP-mediated increase in synaptic transmission onto BLA principal neurons ( Bocchio et al., 2017 ). -->
At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA, especially its lateral part, are described to<!--może jakoś inaczej?--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS and a strong input carrying US information when these experiences are paired, forming ensembles (engrams; see: @josselyn_2018). 
This leads to LTP at those excitatory synapses onto LA neurons, and in turn, enables CS alone to activate them and induce the freezing behavior. <!-- Ensembles of PNs in LA are known to represent memory traces (engrams) in auditory fear conditioning (Josselyn & Frankland, 2018). In this experimental paradigm foot shock (the unconditioned stimulus, US) is paired with a neutral tone (the conditioned stimulus, CS). Subsequent presentations of the CS produce the same fear response (conditionedresponse, CR) produced by foot shock (e.g., freezing and autonomic changes) (LeDoux, 2000). At the neuronal level fear  conditioning involves convergence of nociceptive and auditory inputs onto LA PNs, with subsequent potentiation of excitatory auditory inputs (Rogan, St€ aubli,& LeDoux, 1997). Although the majority of PNs receive these convergent inputs, the engram is represented by only 10%–30% of PNs, namely those that exhibit the highest excitability. Similar ensembles of PNs are also known to represent the engram in appetitive conditioning (Josselyn & Frankland, 2018)./// If animals are subjected to the CS several times alone, then the CS will not predict the threat anymore, i.e., the fear memory will become extinct. This extinction is likely a combination of new learning of safety and updating the original fear memory (Khalaf et al., 2018; Kida, 2019). As -->
Accordingly, it was shown that photoactivation of LA axonal terminals from the auditory thalamus (the medial geniculate nucleus, MGN) and the auditory cortex (AC) when applying footshock (without a neutral tone) results in<!-- were shown to produce?--> conditioned freezing and synaptic potentiation [@nabavi_2014].
Moreover, by combining several approaches to functionally label neurons activated by discriminative auditory fear conditioning paradigm, @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were increased specifically in those terminals activated by fear conditioning (CS+), but not CS- afferents to LA neurons, indicating an input-specific, postsynaptic increase in glutamatergic transmission. <!-- Using this approach, CS+ terminals were first functionally labeled (CHr2-eYFP) during tone presentations after tamoxifen administration. Two weeks later the animals underwent fear conditioning with several conditioning trials (CS+ paired with US) to label LA neurons (tdTomato) activated  by  fear  conditioning.  After 4 days, the animals received discriminative conditioning and were sacrificed thereafter.  As  predicted  by  Hebbian models,  AMPA/NMDA  ratios  in  CS+  Figure 1. Input-Specific LTP in the Lateral Amygdala during Discriminative Fear Conditioning Prior to fear conditioning, sensory afferents carrying information concerning conditional stimuli (CS+, CS - ) from the auditory cortex (ACx) and medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) converge on principal neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA). During conditioning, coincident pre- and post-synaptic activity (red, active synapses and post-synaptic neurons) leads to input-specific long-term potentiation (LTP) at auditory afferents carrying CS+, but not CS - , information. Potentiated CS+ synapses (blue) allow the formerly innocuous CS to drive fear responses by depolarizing LA principal neurons. Neuron afferents (expressing ChR2) were only elevated in recordings from tdTomatopositive LA neurons labeled by fear conditioning, but not in non-labeled neurons./// Again, increases in AMPA/NMDA ratios recorded from LA neurons active during conditioning were specific to CS+ inputs, because randomly selected ACx/MGN afferents did not exhibit changes in AMPA/NMDA ratios in either labeled or non-labeled LA neurons.-->
Moreover, none of the experiments revealed changes in presynaptic site of synaptic efficacy.
<!-- A fundamental property of LTP is that it is only induced at synapses at which there is correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity  (e.g.,  presynaptic  neurotransmitter release coupled with postsynaptic depolarization). It has been argued that the ‘‘input specificity’’ of LTP might serve as a putative mechanism for the selectivity of conditioned fear responses to CSs that predict danger over those that do not ( Shin et al., 2006 ). //// label tone-responsive neurons in the ACx and MGN. Tone exposure recruited substantial numbers of eYFP-positive neurons in the ACx and MGN, and a substantial proportion ( ~ 12%–15%) of those neurons were found to project to LA. Moreover, different populations of ACx/MGN neurons were recruited by tones of different frequencies, revealing frequency-dependent labeled lines projecting to the LA. //// found that AMPA/ NMDA ratios, a postsynaptic correlate of potentiated glutamatergic transmission, were increased in CS+ (but not CS - ) afferents to LA neurons. Moreover, increases  in  AMPA/NMDA  ratios  were specific to CS+ inputs and were not expressed in other auditory afferents to the LA. None of the experiments revealed changes in presynaptic indices of synaptic efficacy.
-->
Although the majority of PNs receive these inputs, it is estimated that the engram is represented by only 10-30% of these cells, namely those showing the highest excitability [@josselyn_2018]. 

<!--Intriguingly, optical stimulation of a subset of principal neurons expressing Thy1 promoter did not affect freezing behavior during fear conditioning, but rather appeared to influence consolidation specifically for memories that oppose fear conditioning [@jasnow_2013]. Stimulation of these neurons enhanced the retention of the extinction learning [@jasnow_2013].--><!-- rozwinąć dlaczego to jest intrguing - że jakaś subtypes of functional relevance albo usunąć /// If animals are subjected to the CS several times alone, then the CS will not predict the threat anymore, i.e., the fear memory will become extinct. This extinction is likely a combination of new learning of safety and updating the original fear memory (Khalaf et al., 2018; Kida, 2019). @hajos_2018 /// A  subset of glutamatergic neurons of the BLA expresses the thymus cell antigen 1 (Thy1) (Jasnow et al., 2013). Optog  enetic and chemogenetic activations of Thy1-expressing neurons inhibit fear consolidation and accelerate mem-ory extinction, respectively (Table 1)(Jasnow et al., 2013;McCullough et al., 2016), while optogenetics inhibition ofThy  1 neurons decreases fear extinction. Interestingly, two electrophysiologically distinct populations of BLA neuronswere identified depending on their response to the extinction of an association of a cue and an electric shock (Herry et  al., 2008). The first population increased its firing frequency in response to the predictive cue during and after fearcond itioning and reduced its firing frequency to the cue during extinction training. The second population onlyincreased its firing rate in response to the cue during extinction training and was named‘fear-off’neurons (Herry et  al., 2008). Further molecular analysis of Thy1 neurons using RNA sequencing identified genes strongly upregulatedin the Thy1 population, including the genes coding for the neurotensin receptor 2 (Ntsr2) and Rspo2 (Rspondin-2)(McCullough et al., 2016). Importantly, pharmacological manipulation of neurotensin receptor 2 (NT2) suggests thatneuron s expressing Ntsr2 within the BLA are putative“Fear-OFF”neurons (McCullough et al., 2016). -->

Analogous to fear conditioning, reward-induced conditioning responses <!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues--> are also associated with a synaptic potentiation in the BLA, leading to a cue-triggered behavior [@clem_2010; @johansen_2010; @tye_2008]. <!-- nowsze cytowania  -->
These findings further support the notion that both learning about danger and potential rewards is adaptive and engages the amygdala [@janak_2015]. <!--poprawić.. Thus, not only fear conditioning, but also reward cue responses develop through long-lasting enhancement of glutamatergic inputs from sensory thalamic stimuli onto LA principal cells in the LA 78. ///  -> Hence, amygdala seems to be involved in learning a spectrum of of positive (rewarding) to negative (aversive) outcomes-->
Moreover, increasing evidence shows that this BLA-mediated regulation of valence-related behavior involves distinct subpopulations of this region, which differentially encode valence. <!-- The  accumulation of results reporting the regulation of valence-related behavior by BLA projections supports the hypothesis that anatomically divergent populations of the BLA differentially encode valence. --> 
Accordingly, photosimulation of those specific subpopulations illustrated that BLA-NAc pathway is preferentially excited by an appetitive stimuli, whereas BLA-CeA connections are preferentially excited by an aversive one [@beyeler_2016; @pignatelli_2019]. <!-- Moreover, recordings combined with optogenetic photoidentification of specific neural subpopulations have shown that BLA-NAc units are preferentially excited by a positive cue and BLA-CeA units are preferentially excited by a negative one (Beyeler et  al., 2016). /// Consistently, recordings of synaptic inputs on BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons show that inputs on BLA-NAc projections are potentiated after reward learning and depressed after fear conditioning, whereas inputs on BLA-CeM neurons are depressed after reward learning and potentiated after learning the association of a cue and a reward (Namburi et al., 2015).

As mentioned above, while compelling evidence has mostly focused on pyramidal-like neurons in the integration of sensory information, there is growing recognition <!-- bardziej attention--> that local interneurons also receive, to some extend, inputs from cortical and thalamic afferents [@smith_2000; @woodson_2000], suggesting an important role of inhibitory synapses in modulating fear memory in the amygdala [@capogna_2014; @hjos_2021; @spampanato_2016]. <!-- (Ehrlich et  al , 2009; Lee et  al , 2013).  nowsze cytowania --><!-- Stimulating afferents from either the cortical or the thalamic pathways have been found to monosynaptically activate BLA and lateral amygdala (LA) GABAergic interneurons, primarily in a feedforward manner (Rainnie et al., 1991b; Washburn and Moises, 1992; Lang and Pare, 1998; Szinyei et al., 2000).  -->

<!-- Stimulation of either the ic, ec or BLA evoked a glutamatergic excitatory synaptic current (EPSC) which was mediated by both non-NMDA and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptors. The ratio of the amplitude of the NMDA receptor-mediated component measured at 1 40 mV to the amplitude of the α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) component measured at –60 mV was similar regardless of  whether EPSCs  were evoked  in the  ec, ic  or BLA neurons.

Particularly, these synapses contain AMPA receptors with low GluR2 subunit in the postsynaptic membrane [@mahanty_1998], and such composition is thought to result in strong inward rectification and calcium permeability [@washburn_1997].
Moreover, in contrary to PCs in the BLA or interneurons from other brain areas, their glutamatergic input contains no NMDA receptors [@mahanty_1998]. <!-- lepiej napisać functional relevance of these properties?????? -->

<!-- nie wiem czy to zdanie ok ///It is well-established that the main source of GABAergic inputs onto BLA projection cells are local interneurons [@bienvenu_2012; @muller_2006; @rainnie_2006; @woodruff_2007a] trochę zmienić tę część /// wcześniej Particularly, BLA local interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, constituting their main source of GABAergic inputs // Previous studies have shown that a large amount of BLA inhibitory activity is provided by locally projecting interneurons (Bienvenu et al. 2012; Muller et al. 2006; Rainnie et al. 2006; Woodruff and Sah 2007), highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on large array of parameters.

Consistent with this notion, several microscopic analyses confirm that <!--in addition to their dendritic and somatic differences in morphology-->BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies, including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons [@mcdonald_2001; @muller_2003; @muller_2005; @muller_2006; @muller_2007]. <!-- wcześniej BLA interneurons display a variety of //  several electron microscopic analyses have revealed that BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct patterns of axonal innervation. /// which innervate distinct subcellular domains of projection neurons and are thought to shape fear memory (Ehrlich et al , 2009;  Li et   al ,  1996;  Mascagni  and  McDonald,  2003;-->
In general, BLA principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA<!-- sprawdzić and  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses. <!-- alternatively On contrary to excitatory inputs both outside and within the BLA, which target distal dendritic processes and spines of projection cells in the BLA citation  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999), GABAergic synapses are reported to be located mostly in perisomatic region of those cells.// Thus, BLA principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses. // Since the perisomatic region is where sodium-mediated action potentials aregenerat ed, the numerous inhibitory GABAergic inputs to this region are important regulators of PN spiking(Freund & Katona, 2007).

Moreover, among interneurons, minor differences in a subcellular target of PCs are reflective of distinct subtypes. <!-- there is some diversity/ variability, based on the interneuronal subpopulations//   diversity and the properties that distinguish cell types. //  features that can be a basis for distinguishing among IN subtypes, patterns, exhibit functional differences.// differ in // have been identified// differences in firing pattern are reflective of distinct -->
Specifically, interneurons expressing PV and CCK formed axonal arborizations, targeting perisomatic regions, which  can be distinguished from distal dendrites by the expression of the voltage gated potassium channel subunit Kv2.1 [@vereczki_2016],  such as the soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment of principal cells [@mcdonald_2001; @muller_2005; @muller_2006]. <!-- expression of channel /// Recent studies indicate that proximal dendrites can be distinguished from distal dendrites by the expression of the voltage gated potassium channel subunit Kv2.1, as well as by their robust innervation by GABAergic terminals (Vereczki et al.,2016).

Consequently, axo-axonic cells may excite rather than inhibit their postsynaptic pyramidal cells ( Szabadics et al., 2006 ). /// However, we found that AACs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic GABAergic inputs.

These observations suggest that there are robust reciprocal perisomatic PN-to-PV connections that may be important for the precise timing of rhythmic activity in the basolateral amygdala. [@mcdonald_2005]-->
Among PV-expressing interneurons, chandelier cells were demonstrated to primarily innervate the axon initial segment (AIS) of principal cells [@bienvenu_2012], whereas basket cells form a continuum, varying proportions of perisomatic and distal dendritic synapses with principal neurons [@veres_2017]. <!-- zmienić trochę// Axo-axonic cells primarily innervated the initial axon segment of principal cells, while amygdalo-striatal cells formed perisomatic innervation of principal neurons and also medium spiny neurons in the amygdala-striatum border (Bienvenu et al. 2012). ///// // The axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, AACs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. //// By using model to specifically remove inhibitory synapses at the axon initial segment (AIS) of BLA projection neurons, @saha_2016 have illustrated that modification of inhibitory synapses at this small region of BLA projection neurons is sufficient to selectively specifically impair the extinction in fear-conditioning paradigm as well as the ventral subiculum–BLA LTP in vivo. ///While this manipulation did not affect anxiety-like behavior and fear memory acquisition and consolidation, it impaired extinction. // PVBCs actually form a continuum, with each individual cell forming varying proportions of perisomatic (somata and  proximal dendrites) versus distal dendritic synapses with PNs (Veres et al., 2017).-->
In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of PCs [@muller_2007]. <!-- Regional differences in the connectivity of interneuron subtypes are also observed for somatostatin-containing interneurons, which predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of principal cells // Other interneurons expressing somatostatin (SOM), VIP, CR, and CCK also target dendrites or somata (Mascagni and McDonald,  2003;  Muller  et  al.,  2007a).  -->
Noting that distal dendrites receive extensive excitatory inputs, the position of inhibition relative to excitatory inputs influences how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials<!-- directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in -->, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: @tremblay_2016). <!-- woodruff 2006  On the other hand, inhibitory inputs to distal dendrites, which receive extensive excitatory inputs, can regulate dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity, the generation of calcium-dependent action potentials in dendrites, as well as back-propagation of action potentials from somatic to dendritic compartments (Miles, Toth,  Gulyas, Hajos, & Freund, 1996;Stuart, Spruston, Sakmann, & Hausser, 1997). ///  ///  By using recordings from apical dendrites, it was showed that while activity in L5 pyramidal neurons disynaptically coupled via the Sst INs directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in neighboring pyramidal neurons, INs that target the perisomatic area of PCs, such as PV and Cck basket cells and chandelier cells, have a stronger influence on regulating the spiking output of the cell, its timing, and thus the firing synchrony of populations of neurons ( Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996; Royer et al., 2012 ). //// the location of inhibition relative to excitatory inputs will affect how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor and summate and activate voltage-gated conductances. // Thus, interneurons targeting perisomatic regions are strategically placed to modulate somatic action potential generation (Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996), whereas those terminating more distally may prevent dendritic action potentials (Miles et al., 1996), modulate the induction  of  glutamatergic  synaptic  plasticity  (Magee  and Johnston, 1997), or gate the transfer of information along the somatodendritic axis (Buzsaki et al., 1996) ///// somatostatin-containing interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of PCs [@muller_2007] // --><!-- wcześniej: form complex...--><!--Thus, the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA [@muller_2006; @klenowski_2015].

This architecture could play an important role in the suppression of background neural noise, thereby enhancing the response of LA cells to incoming auditory stimuli. //  Synapses are made not only on principal neurons, primarily at distal dendritic processes and spines (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999), but interneurons in the BLA have also were reported to receive monosynaptic contacts from those cortical and thalamic sensory afferents [@szinyei_2000].//// Thus, the  somata and axon initial segments of BLa PNs are only targeted by axons forming GABAergic symmetrical synapses. Dendritic shafts of BLa PNs are innervated by axons forming symmetrical (inhibitory or neuromodulatory) synapses and axons forming asymmetrical (excitatory) synapses. The former are more common on proximal dendritic shafts versus distal dendritic shafts (Muller et al., 2006). There are relatively few asymmetrical (excitatory) synapses with  proximal dendrites. However, the majority of inputs to spines of BNC PNs are excitatory (70%). ///// Previous EM studies of the BNC indicate that axon terminals forming asymmetrical synapses represent glutamatergic inputs from the cerebral cortex, midline/intralaminar thalamus, and internuclear and intranuclear amygdalar connections arising from BNC PNs, whereas many of the symmetrical synapses onto BNC PNs are formed by several distinct subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons (see below). -->
Similar to excitatory input, monoaminergic projections also form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines. <!-- monoaminergic projections from the brainstem and cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain (BF) also form symmetrical synapses in the BNC, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines (see below).. // The main targets of all of these neuromodulatory inputs are distal dendrites and spines of PNs, where they can regulate synaptic plasticity involved in emotional learning.// .--> 
Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA.
However, the ... <!-- nie wiem czy tutaj nie napisać, że to jest outside the scope of this thesis and is comprehensively reviewered in prager_2016--><!-- Another feature that differentiate BLA interneuronal subtypes is the regulation by neuromodulators. --><!-- expression// regulation  -->
Nonetheless, it should be briefly noted, that neuromodulators and their receptors are differently distributed within all subtypes in the amygdala, inducing broad repertoire <!--array--> of electrophysiological effects, adding another level of complexity to BLA computations. 
For example, dopaminergic projections  synapse on BLA projection neurons and PV- and CR-immunopositive GABAergic interneurons (Brinley-Reed and McDonald, 1999; Pinard et al., 2008),  <!-- jeszcze jakoś inaczej niż excitatory and inhibitory cell types? /// Dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) promotes fear learning by disinhibiting principal neurons (PNs) and enabling synaptic plasticity in their sensory inputs. // Recent results suggest that DA-dependent signaling in the BLA specifically targets GABAergic transmission (Bissiere 2003; Kroneret  al, 2005; Marowskyet  al, 2005). -->
However, compared with CR-immunopositive interneurons, PV interneurons appear to be the preferential target of dopaminergic synapses in the BLA (Pinard et al., 2008). <!-- zmienić -->
Moreover, DA selectively inhibited the GABA release from PV-immunopositive interneurons to principal cells, but not to other interneurons, by acting *via* D2 receptors [@chu_2012]. <!--  Specifically,  demonstrated that activation of D2 receptor in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in LA reduced GABAergic transmission only to principal cells, but not to interneurons. /// We found that DA selectively suppressed GABAergic transmission from PV-INs to PNs by acting on presynaptic D2 receptors, and this effect was mimicked by Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent signaling.--> 
This target-specific modulation enables shunting principal cells, whereas inhibitory inputs remains unaltered.<!-- zmienić // This target-specific neurochemical modulation enables a sharp disinhibition of principal cells not accompanied by a concomitant alteration of the inhibitory inputs. // In contrast, DA did not alter GABA release from PV-INs to INs.

<!-- SPRAWDZIĆ JAKI PATTERN -->
This pattern of local innervation within the BLA is regarded as critical for the generation of synchronous firing of principal cells, facilitating rhythmic oscillations and synaptic plasticity involved in consolidation of emotional memories [@klenowski2015; @mcdonald_2004].<!-- zmienić bardziej //  These networks may be critical for the generation of synchronized rhythmic oscillations involved in consolidation of emotional memories @mcdonald_2004 //// This level of somatodendritic organization, coupled with reciprocal excitatory connections provided by principal cells (McDonald et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2000), which can fire synchronously (Pare et al. 1995; Pare and Gaudreau 1996), may facilitate the propagation of inhibitory signals within the BLA.  /// Furthermore, the subsequent inhibitory feedback onto principal cells is thought to contribute to rhythmic cell firing and synchronization of BLA activity (Pare et al. 2002). This was recently demonstrated for rhythmic compound IPSCs of PV interneurons, which improved spike-timing precision and synchronized principal cell firing in the BLA (Ryan et al. 2012). [@klenowski_2015] -->

This synchronization can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals, which precisely allows the activation of glutamatergic activity to drive behavioral responses (Courtin et al., 2014; Herry and Johansen, 2014). <!-- zmienić-->
Indeed, <!-- accumulating evidence? -->synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA [@bauer_2007; @pelletier_2004]. 

For example, the initiation and expression of fear requires synchronization of amygdala activity, among other regions (Stujenske et al., 2014). <!-- zmienić--> 
Ongoing research has revealed that the theta and the faster gamma oscillations may be fundamental to circuits underlying sensory processing and cognitive functions and that changes in emotional states may be mediated by alterations in BLA gamma coupling to theta frequency inputs (Fries, 2009; Stujenske et al., 2014). <!-- zmienić // Moreover, synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA [@bauer_2007; @pelletier_2004]. .--> 
The activity of PV interneurons has been implicated in theta synchrony within the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC; Courtin et al., 2014) because suppression of PV interneuronal activity in the PFC is necessary to disinhibit prefrontal projection neurons to the BLA, thereby synchronizing their firing by resetting local theta oscillations. <!-- zmienić-->
Although this work has not yet been confirmed in the amygdala it has been hypothesized that inhibiting PV interneurons in the BLA might also synchronize activity and enhance fear responses (Stujenske et al., 2014).<!-- zmienić // prager 2016 -->

In addition, @huff_2013 highlighted the role of gamma frequency (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, induced in the BLA by bursts of light pulses, in enhancing retention. <!-- końcówka może inaczej?-->

###### Efferents {#BLAoutputs}

Despite being the main input of the amygdaloid complex, the BLA is also reported to send some projections, regulating multiple behaviors and emotions (for reviews: @duvarci_2014; @par_2002; @sah_2003). <!--/// Of note, there are exceptions to this serial model of information flow; the BA and CeA also receive sensory inputs, and the CeA contributes to some behavioural processes independently from the BLA 23,24 //// The BLA has two main output fiber bundles which originate in the amygdala: the stria terminalis and the amygdalofugal pathway (Leonard & Scott, 1971; Mori et al., 2017). The stria terminalis connects the amygdala to the septal area of the basal forebrain and hypothalamus, while the amygdalofugal pathway is believed to contain both afferent and efferent connections to the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Through these two pathways and direct axonal projections, the BLA targets a wide range of cortical and subcortical downstream regions. // to facilitate the coordination of emotional responses.  // regulates multiple behaviors and emotions by projecting to multiple brain regions. // BLA principal neurons send projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (Tye et al. 2011), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Weller and Smith 1982), nucleus accumbens (Stuber et al. 2011), and medial prefrontal cortex (Senn et al. 2014) to facilitate the coordination of emotional responses. /// One of the best studied function that BLA complex is involved is anxiety. // Their axons course through the stria terminalis, ventral amygdalofugal pathway, and external capsule to reach targets in the forebrain.  //  Through these two pathways and direct axonal projections, the BLA targets a wide range of cortical and subcortical downstream regions. For a comprehensive list of downstream targets of the BLA, please refer to Pitkanen (2000b).-->
Among many sensory inputs mentioned in previous section (\@ref(BLAinputs)), mainly prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially its medial part, and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) have strong reciprocal connections with the BLA complex [@sah_2003]. 
In contrast, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the CeA.  <!--  zmienić /// predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the striatum, especially the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the CeA. ///In turn, the striatum, BNST and CeA have been considered to mediate the translation of BLA signals to behavioural output. // Hence, the BLA transmits information widely throughout cortical regions, but its neuronal processing is greatly affected by excitatory projections from these regions.  /// At the output sites, both the LA and BA innervate a substantial part of the basal ganglia, including the nucleus accumbens, olfactory  tuberculum,  and  posterior  striatum  (McDonald, 1991). Moreover, the LA and BA target the amygdalostriatal transition area (astria) and the dorsomedial striatum, respectively (McDonald, 1992; Barsy et al., 2020).Besides the basal ganglia, the BLA also projects to other striatal structures that are considered to be parts of the amygdala or rather the extended amygdala, namely the central nucleus of amygdala, interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC), and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST; Sah et al., 2003)./// Moreover, electrophysiology analysis suggested that the effects of stimulating BLA inputs to the ventral hippocampus were mediated through local circuit mechanisms involving both direct activation of principal cells in the hippocampus and indirect recruitment of inhibitory neurons. /// The effects with stimulation were blocked with microinjections of glutamate receptor antagonists into the ventral hippocampus, indicating that the results were due to stimulation of BLA axon terminals and the concomitant release of glutamate from those terminals.///  zmienić i nie wiem czy to ująć--> 
Although a great majority of the BLA projections are excitatory and most of BLA interneurons form local synapses, there is a small fraction of long-range inhibitory interneurons, projecting to the entorhinal cortex [@mcdonald_2015] or the basal forebrain [@mcdonald_2012] as well as mPFC and periaqueductal grey (PAG) [@sun_2019]. <!-- oryginał: With the exception of few long-range inhibitory interneurons, projecting to the entorhinal cortex (McDonald & Zaric, 2015a) or the basal forebrain (McDonald, Mascagni, & Zaric, 2012), inhibitory interneurons synapse locally, whereas excitatory neurons are projection neurons. /// However, recent studies have shown that GABAergic long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) in the cortex also contribute to inter-areal connections. <!-- Despite innervating locally /// The present study combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for cortical nonpyramidal neuronal markers to determine if cortical LRNP neurons project to the BLC in the rat.

About half of the SOM+ neurons in the lateral entorhinal area labeled by FG were GABA+. FG+ neurons containing parvalbumin were only seen in the basal forebrain, and no FG+ neurons containing vasoactive intestinal peptide were observed in any brain region. Since LRNP neurons involved in corticocortical connections are critical for synchronous oscillations that allow temporal coordination between distant cortical regions, the LRNP neurons identified in this study may play a role in the synchronous oscillations of the BLC and hippocampal region that are involved -->

Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways.  @senn_2014 // Moreover, multiple BLA projections to cortical and subcortical regions have been revealed to regulate defensive behaviors./// Of note, there are other pathways that originate in the BLA that have since been implicated in bidirectional regulation of anxiety. Optically driving BLA projections to the ventral HPC (vHPC) is anxiogenic [@felixortiz_2013] , whereas photostimulation of BLA inputs in the anterodorsal BNST (adBNST) is anxiolytic [@kim_2013]. Photostimulation of the BLA–Vhpc pathway also decreases social interaction, an effect perhaps related to the increase in anxiety that is seen following BLA–vHPC activation /// Felix-Ortiz et al. found that inhibition of BLA afferents to the ventral hippocampus, via activation of halorhodopsin, decreased anxiety-related behaviors. Similarly, stimulation of such afferents, using 20 Hz light pulses to activate ChR2, increased anxiety-related behaviors. In other work, Felix-Ortiz and Tye (2014) examined optical stimulation and inhibition of the BLA axon terminals in the ventral hippocampus during tests of social behavior. In a resident-juvenile-intruder test, stimulation of these terminals, using 20 Hz light pulses, reduced social interactions of the resident, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased such interactions, suggesting that activation of this pathway increased anxiety in the animals whereas silencing of this pathway produced the opposite effect. ////  -->
Moreover, optogenetic manipulations of BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`CeA pathway was also shown to regulate anxiety in the same bidirectional manner as BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`vHPC and BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`mPFC projections [@tye_2011].<!-- temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)—achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA—exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin15 (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. /// The amygdala is important for determining the emotional significance of environmental stimuli. However, the degree to which appetitive and aversive stimuli are processed by the same or different neuronal circuits within the amygdala remains unclear.-->

The BLA complex is also a key part of neural circuits involved in regulation of valence-related behavior. <!-- BLA is a key part of the neural circuit that drives-->
Accumulating evidence suggest that divergent subpopulations of the BLA neurons differentially encode fearful or rewarding associations (for example: @kyriazi_2018). <!-- The  accumulation of results reporting the regulation of valence-related behavior by BLA projections supports the hypothesis that anatomically divergent populations of the BLA differentially encode valence. // Finally, a recent study has also identified that even if relatively few cells encode valence in the BLA, valence can be decoded from the neural activity at the population level (Kyriazi et al., 2018). // Conditioned  appetitive  and  aversive  responses (CRs) are thought to result from the activation of specific subsets of valence-coding basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons. // Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive1,2and negative3–7.

Consistent with this notion, it was reported that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or the central amygdala (CeA) undergo opposing synaptic changes during conditioned appetitive and aversive emotional responses [@namburi_2015]. <!-- zmienić /// Conditioned  appetitive  and  aversive  responses (CRs)  // Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning.// BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. // Conversely,optogenetic activation of BLA projections to the nucleus accumbens (BLA-NAc) has repeatedly been shown to support positive reinforcement (Britt et al., 2012; Namburi et al., 2015; Stuber et al., 2011), and pharmacological disconnection of the BLA and NAc identified that the BLA-NAc pathway is critical for cocaine seeking (Di Ciano & Everitt, 2004). /// Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive1,2and negative3–7.

Specifically, BLA neurons projecting to NAc were reported to respond preferentially to reward-predictive cue [@beyeler_2016] and optogenetic stimulation of those neurons was documented to facilitate reward seeking <!--and is mediated by intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signaling-->, whereas optical inhibition of the BLA terminals in NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose [@namburi_2015; @stuber_2011].
Conversely, while BLA neurons targeting the CeM are preferentially excited to a stimulus predicting an aversive outcome [@beyeler_2016] and optical stimulation of BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`CeM pathway increases fear conditioning and decrease reward learning, photoinhibition of those neurons impair fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning [@namburi_2015]. <!--  BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (BLA-NAc) were shown to respond preferentially to a reward-predictive cue ( Beyeler et al., 2016 ), and the synaptic strength of the glutamatergic inputs onto these projectors increased after reward conditioning ( Namburi et al., 2015 ). Conversely, BLA neurons projecting to the medial aspect of the central amygdala (BLA-CeM) are preferentially excited to a stimulus predicting an aversive outcome ( Beyeler et al., 2016 ), and the synaptic strength of their inputs increased after fear conditioning ( Namburi et al., 2015 ). /// We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. /// As part of understanding the precise role played by the BLA in such behaviors, Stuber et al. (2011) examined the pathway from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NA) core in modulating and driving reinforcement of operant behavior. // Although previous evidence had suggested that the BLA could directly influence dopamine release in the NA (Howland et al., 2002), a key mechanism for reinforcement, it was not clear whether activity in the BLA inputs to the NAcore could actually reinforce operant behavior or was necessary for reward seeking. // Stuber et al. found that mice engaged in an operant behavior (nose pokes) in order to receive optical stimulation (burst of 20 Hz light pulses) of the BLA axon terminals in the NAcore. Similarly, optical inhibition, via activation of halorhodopsin, of the BLA terminals decreased responding for a sucrose reward. Strikingly, optical stimulation of mPFC inputs to the NAcore did not produce the same effects. Other work has shown that optical stimulation of BLA inputs to the NAshell are also reinforcing (Britt et al., 2012), though, in contrast to the mPFC inputs to the NAcore, stimulation of mPFC inputs or ventral hippocampal inputs to the NAshell was also found to be reinforcing.  Together, these findings illustrate not only the increasing evidence for a role for BLA glutamatergic inputs to the NA in regulating reinforcement and reward but also that, depending on the part of the NA targeted, other glutamatergic inputs do not necessarily produce identical results // BLA is a key part of the neural circuit that drives drug-seeking behavior triggered by drug-associated cues (See et al., 2003). However, as the BLA projects to both the PL and the NA core, both of which are considered critical components of a general drug-seeking circuit (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001; McFarland et al., 2004; LaLumiere and Kalivas, 2008), it has not been clear which pathway is responsible for driving cue-induced drug-seeking.  /// that neurons of this region are responding to stimuli of positive and stimuli of negative valence (Beyeler et al., 2016;Fuster & Uyeda, 1971;Paton et al., 2006;Shabel & Janak, 2009). Recordings of BLA neurons in monkeys, rats, and mice have shown that around 50% of the units respond to predictive cues of positive or negative valence (Beyeler et al., 2016;Kyriazi, Headley, & Pare, 2018;Paton et al., 2006), with an overrepresentation of neurons responding to positive valence in monkeys (Paton et al., 2006) and mice (Beyeler et al., 2016), and an even distribution of neuron responding to both valences in rats (Kyriazi et al., 2018). Additionally, pioneering work has shown that some BLA neurons track the value of a sensory stimulus during reversal of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS and US) association (Paton et al., 2006;Schoenbaum, Chiba, & Gallagher, 1999) emphasizing the critical role of the BLA in valence coding. Finally, a recent study has also identified that even if relatively few cells encode valence in the BLA, valence can be decoded from the neural activity at the population level (Kyriazi et al., 2018). // Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling.

Thus, we are beginning to unravel how a single brain region can encode such opposite behaviors, which is of high relevance and warrants further investigation.<!--How brain circuits achieve the ability to attribute valence to sensory information and orchestrate the behavior to approach rewards and avoid danger remains only partially understood./// Despite increasing knowledge of anatomical and molecular properties of amygdala neurons, we are just starting to unravel their contribution to valence // It is currently not well understood whether and how //  In order to understand how a single brain region can encode such opposite behaviors, it is necessary to integrate additional features beyond the location in the brain, including synaptic input, projection targets, and molecular markers (Beyeler, 2016;Janak & Tye, 2015). /// Orchestrating appropriate behavioral responses in the face of competing signals that predict either rewards or threats in the  environment is crucial for survival.///  Moreover, while the incidence of valence-coding cells did not exceed chance, at the population level there was similarity between valence coding for CSs and CRs.

The BLA-CeA projectors collateralize mainly to the NAc, mildly to the mPFC and almost not in the vHPC. Finally, BLA-vHPC projectors send collaterals mainly in the mPFC and anterior NAc, and weakly in caudal NAc and CeA (Beyeler et al., 2016). Taking into account the collateralizations to multiple brain regions increases the heterogeneity of defining features of each BLA neuron. Note-worthy, genetic markers potentially correspond to defining those features that could map onto the collateralization pattern as well as the valence coding properties of projection neurons.

<!-- summary? 
The functional neuroanatomy of the BNC is exceedingly complex. Each nucleus has connections with more than a dozen distinct cortical and subcortical brain regions. Moreover, discrete cell types within each nucleus may play different functional roles. Thus, individual nuclei may contain PNs with distinct functions and projections (e.g., fear neurons vs. extinction neurons in BL) and INs that innervate distinct PN domains (e.g., PV and CCK basket cells vs. SOM dendrite-targeting INs in the BNC).
Of particular interest are the neuromodulatory systems; the expression of distinct monoaminergic and cholinergic receptor subtypes in discrete BNC neuronal populations, especially distinct IN subpopulations, suggests that the activity of the BNC may be subtly modulated to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. -->

Notably, another critical components of amygdala fear circuits and BLA outputs are the intercalated cells (ITCs), GABAergic neurons surrounding the BLA. <!-- zmienić /// involved in fear conditioning   /// Intercalated (ITC) cells are inhibitory neurons that surround the BLA /// The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are partners in fear learning and extinction. ///  BLA-> CeA interface/communication /// (mpITCs)are thought to relay activity from basolateral nucleus (BLA) and prefrontal cortex to inhibit central amygdala output during suppression of fear.

#### Intercalated cell masses {#ITCs}

<!-- introduction - clusters and location --> 
Intercalated cells (ITCs) do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the amygdala. <!-- figure --><!-- citations --><!-- ITCs are GABAergic cells with  . // The latter contain the highest density of GABAergic cells in the amygdala, and are organised in clusters surrounding the BLA -->
Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into: (1)  lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITC~L~),  bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITC~MP~, localized within intermediate<!--internal?--> capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA,<!--medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) --> and  (3) the main intercalated nucleus (ITC~main~), the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA [@mako_2011; @millhouse_1986].<!-- figure// The ITC clusters can be further divided into the medial and lateral intercalated cell cluster and main intercalated nucleus (mITC, lITC and Im, respectively), based on their different locations. The Im nucleus, the biggest cluster among ITCs, is located ventro-medially to the BLA (Millhouse, 1986; Pare & Smith, 1994). @mańko 2015  wcześniej: In particular, these fiber bundles are the external capsule bordering on the lateral part of the BLA and the intermediate capsule. Clusters located in the external and intermediate capsules are here referred to as lateral () and medial (ITC~M~), respectively.-->

Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (10–15 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle [@mcdonald_1993; @nitecka_1987], <!-- Morphologically, they have ovoid cell bodies and their dendritic trees are spiny, flattened, long, and mostly remains within border of ///  the fiber bundle where their soma is located [@millhouse_1986]. ..., the smallest interneurons in the amygdala complex , --> and larger (>50 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`m) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the basolateral amygdaloid complex or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices. [@bienvenu_2015]. <!-- The axons of L-ITCcs also project to distant brain areas, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices.-->
Although most ITCs displayed opioid receptor <!--mu...-->, GABA~A~ receptor 3 subunit, FoxP2, and intense labeling for GABA [@busti_2011], <!--  express ... As shown in Figure 1, all identified ITC clusters displayedopioid receptor (OR) (Fig. 1 C ) (Likhtik et al., 2008), GABAAreceptor3 subunit (Fig. 1 E ) (Ma rowsky et al., 2004), and FoxP2 (Fig. 1 G ) (Kaoru et al., 2010) IR as well as intense labeling for GABA (Fig. 1 H ). @busti_2011 ...,-->larger interneurons are additionally characterized by strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (mGluR1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`), GABA~A~ receptors `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`1 subunit, and PV [@bienvenu_2015]. <!-- wcześniej Additionally, these neurons are surrounded by a small subset of ... /// Among GABAergic neurons, the so-called intercalated cells (ITCs) are critically involved in the expression and extinction of fear memory. Tightly clustered small-sized spiny neurons constitute the majority of ITCcs, but they are surrounded by sparse, larger neurons (L-ITCcs) for which very little information is known. /// In vivo recorded L-ITCcs are strongly activated by noxious stimuli, such as hindpaw pinches or electrical footshocks. Consistent with this, we observed  synaptic contacts on L-ITCc dendrites from nociceptive intralaminar thalamic nuclei. /// We propose that, during salient sensory stimulation, L-ITCcs disinhibit local and distant principal neurons, acting as “hub cells,” to orchestrate the activity of a distributed network. -->

Besides their well-known inputs from BLA principal cells, ITCs express the highest density of `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B5")`-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala [@jacobsen_2006; @palomarescastillo_2012; @pape_2010]<!--[@marowsky_2005]-->, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.

Moreover, both types of cells share similar electrophysiological features, including lower membrane capacitance,  higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency compared with BLA and CeA interneurons.  [@busti_2011; @geracitano_2007; @mako_2011; @royer_2000]. <!-- (Royer et al. 1999; Marowsky et al. 2005; Geracitano et al. 2007). --> <!-- most of ITCs have higher membrane resistance and firing frequency compared with BLA and CeA interneurons. /// Consistent with our previous report (Geracitano et al., 2007), these neurons exhibited relatively high input resistance ( 400 MOhm ), maximal firing frequency up to 30 Hz with limited adaptation, and moderate action potential width (Fig. 2 B )./// One exception was the resting membrane potential that was more depolarised in Im cells than in other ITCs. manko 2011, big vs small cells --> 
Their high intrinsic firing frequency could be explained by their expression of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) after action potential, reflecting slowly-inactivating potassium currents (I~SD~) [@royer_2000]. <!-- zmienić -->

<!-- heterogeneity between/within clusters -->
However, increasing evidence points to some functional diversity<!--heterogeneity--> within and between ITC clusters. <!-- zmienić // Moreover, the functional homogeneity of ITC clusters has also been challenged by the finding that, in a mouse strain deficient at extinguishing conditioned fear, the medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) showed a differential pattern of neuronal activation compared with other clusters (Hefner et al., 2008; Whittle et al., 2010).--> 
For instance, neurons of the ITC~mp~ cluster showed stronger pattern of neuronal activation compared with other ITC clusters following<!--regarding--> fear-conditioning (Hefner et al., 2008; Whittle et al., 2010), whereas the activation of ITC~main~ neurons is stronger after extinction and extinction retrieval [@busti_2011], suggesting a specific role of this nucleus in emotional processing.<!-- are synaptically coupled with variable synaptic strengths dependent on the frequency of presynaptic cell firing and this functional diversity is correlated to peculiar dendritic and axonal patterns of different cell pairs [@geracitano_2007]. --><!-- Neurons of the mITC cluster are synaptically coupled with variable synaptic strengths dependent on the frequency of presynaptic cell firing and this functional diversity is correlated to peculiar dendritic and axonal patterns of different cell pairs (Geracitano et al. 2007).// Moreover, the functional homogeneity of ITC clusters has also been challenged by the finding that, in a mouse strain deficient at extinguishing conditioned fear, the medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) showed a differential pattern of neuronal activation compared with other clusters (Hefner et al., 2008; Whittle et al., 2010). // (1) selected lesions of mITCs result in a marked deficit in the expression of fear extinction (Likhtik et al. 2008); // excitability of mITCs is enhanced after fear extinction (Amano et al. 2010); -->
<!-- Three types of mITCs have been recognised based on their axonal projections, and one of them innervates the Im nucleus, forming functional GABAergic synapses (Busti et al. 2011). --><!-- different activation amongst ITC clusters has been detected in rodents displaying an impairment of fear extinction (Hefner et al. 2008). ///  Recently, the ITC clusters have been shown to play a crucial role in emotional regulation and attracted strong and widespread interest. --> <!--Key observations are: (1) selected lesions of mITCs result in a marked deficit in the expression of fear extinction (Likhtik et al. 2008); (2) excitability of mITCs is enhanced after fear extinction (Amano et al. 2010); (3) mITCs and lITCs are directly inhibited by dopamine (DA) (Marowsky et al. 2005), providing a cellular substrate for the DA-induced disinhibition of the amygdala at the systemic level (Rosenkranz & Grace, 1999); (4) the anxiolytic-like effect of neuropeptide S is mediated by enhanced synaptic excitation of mITCs but not of other cell types of amygdala (Jungling et al. 2008).  mańko_2015-->
Interestingly, dopamine, crucial neuromodulator of neuronal activity within amygdala complex, selectively hyperpolarizes and depresses the excitability of interneurons in ITC~mp~ and ITC~L~ clusters,  whereas other interneurons of the amygdala showed increased excitability, resulting in a disinhibition of the BLA and CeA nuclei [@marowsky_2005].  <!-- znacznie bardziej zmienić Interestingly, dopamine, which enhances fear learning and expression (Borowski & Kokkinidis, 1998), selectively hyperpolarizes and depresses the excitability of Ip cells while exciting other interneurons of amygdala, resulting in a disinhibition of the BL and Ce nuclei (Marowsky et al. 2005). /// mITCs and lITCs are directly inhibited by dopamine (DA) (Marowsky et al. 2005), providing a cellular substrate for the DA-induced disinhibition of the amygdala at the systemic level (Rosenkranz & Grace, 1999); -->

Heterogeneity between ITCs clusters regards also their connectivity, especially lateral and medial clusters.<!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
ITC~L~ 
For example, ITC~PM~ receives inputs from prefrontal infralimbic prefrontal cortex, whereas ITC~L~ neurons are the target of cortical and thalamic auditory projections [@strobel_2015]. <!-- Notably, infralimbic prefrontal (IL) input to mITC neurons is thought to play a key role in fear extinction. ///lITC neurons receive auditory input from cortical and thalamic regions. [@strobel_2015] /// Here, we show that mpITCs receive convergent sensory thalamic and cortical inputs that undergo fear learning-related changes and are dynamically modulated via presynaptic GABABreceptors recruited by GABA released from the mpITC network. @ascede_2015-->
In addition to their distinct inputs, intercalated neurons are interconnected <!--form GABAergic reciprocal synapses onto other intercalated cell /// [@Geracitano2012; @Royer2000]dodać cytowania--> within each cluster as well as between clusters, at least between dorsal and ventral medial clusters []. <!-- CITATIONS //   within each ITC cluster,  -->
At the output side, ITC~L~ neurons provide feed-forward inhibition to BLA principal neurons, whereas ITC~M~ neurons form an inhibitory interface between the BLA and CeA [@marowsky_2005].<!--It is tempting to speculate that similar to their medial counterparts, these intercalated neurons modulate cortical inputs to the BLA. Similar to BLA connections pattern, neurons in ITC cluster located dorsolaterally (ICMMD) send more projections to the CeM than CeL, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in dorsally located ITC mass [@Royer1999; @Pare1993] -->
As intercalated cells inhibit neurons in the CeA, thereby their activity is thought to have an impact on the output of this structure. <!-- może lepiej napisać -->
Consistent with this notion, 
Here, we show that mpITCs receive convergent sensory thalamic and cortical inputs that undergo fear learning-related changes and are dynamically modulated via presynaptic GABABreceptors recruited by GABA released from the mpITC network. 
Among mpITCs, we identify cells that inhibit but are also mutually activated by BLA principal neurons. Thus, mpITCs take part in fear learning-modulated feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuits to simultaneously control amygdala input and output nuclei. 
Our findings place mpITCs in a unique position to gate acquired amygdala-dependent behaviors via their direct sensory inputs. <!-- @ascede_2015-->



#### Central amygdala {#CeAstructure}

Central amygdala (CeA), mainly a GABAergic nucleus, is comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM) and intermediate (CeI) divisions [@jolkkonen_1998; @mcdonald_1982a; @sah_2003]; however, the classification of these regions is inconsistent. <!-- inne cytowanie? problem z nim bo takiego nie ma  [@Cassell1986].-->
Importantly, the capsular region of the CeA appears to overlap with intercalated cell clusters [@mcdonald_1982a; @pape_2010] and will be hereafter referred to as ITCs. <!-- sprawdzić na pewno -->
However, CeA is commonly divided into the CeL and CeM divisions and there is a sparse number of investigations regarding CeI and CeL as a functionally and anatomically distinct subdivisions [@ciocchi_2010; @duvarci_2014; @haubensak_2010]. <!-- sprawdzić cytowania....bo nie rozumiem.... Therefore, in this dissertation, the latter classification will be used. odwołanie się do figury!!!!-->
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), is also considered to be a part of extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and intra-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense inter-connectivity [@fox_2015; @sah_2003]. 
However, BNST is out of the scope of this dissertation and will not be discussed here. 

##### Neuronal composition

Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered as a main output nuclei [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016].
Neurons within this nucleus are diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and *in vivo* patterns of activity.<!-- figure /// with different functional and molecular features. //  -->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons [@mcdonald_1993; @sun_1993], further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA [@medina_2004; @waclaw_2010]. 
Precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neurons-like morphology,  <!--with numerous branches with high density of-->
On the other hand, CeM neurons have a large soma, dendrites with few branches with low density of dendritic spines [@cassell_1989; @mcdonald_1982a]. <!--[@Marina1999; @Hall1972-->

Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF) and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), both accounting for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of whole CeA neuronal population and are:<!--inny czasownik?--> (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells [@marina_1999]. <!-- figure-->

<!-- description of Late Firing neurons--><!-- exhibiting a substantial delay to action potential (AP) initiation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. -->
LF neurons display a pronounced delay before onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections. <!-- figure? -->
It is thought that this characteristic delay<!--synonym--> is mediated by K~v1~-dependent slowly inactivated D-type K^+^ currents [@hou_2016; @martina_1999].

<!-- description of Regular Spiking neurons -->
generating repetitive firing spikes [@dumont_2002; @lopezdearmentia_2004].


Fast-spiking cells shows a high membrane resistance and a high action potential frequency (>40 Hz), showing no accommodation, analogous to a subtype of interneurons present in the cortex, the hippocampus or the BLA,  discussed in previous section. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with > 1 ms in other cell types in CeA. <!-- citations? -->
They have also higher frequency of spontaneous synaptic potentials (sEPSPs). <!-- citations? -->
<!--  CeA neurons display aspiny morphology. which one? citations? -->
<!--These neurons likely correspond to local-circuit cells.  which one? -->
<!-- neuromarkers and morphology? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Low-threshold bursting cells are endowed with T-type calcium channels, giving rise to spike bursts. <!-- citations? -->
One of their characteristics is the presence of rebound spikes after hyperpolarizing current step [@dumont_2002; @hou_2016]. <!-- fig -->
<!-- neuromarkers? -->
<!-- more about channels -->

Like neurons in striatum, neuronal cells in CeA also express wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including protein kinase C`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` (PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`), somatostatin (SOM), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin and others [@cassell_1989; @haubensak_2010].
Of these, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` and SOM are the two most highly expressed and largely non-overlapping neurochemical markers [@haubensak_2010; @hunt_2017; @li_2013].
<!-- inne przejście ale połączyć -->
Considering the expression of immunohistochemical markers, together with their electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections, two groups of CeA neurons have emerged: those expressing protein kinase C `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+) or somatostatin (SOM+). <!-- -->
<!--Of note, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` marker is specific to CeA. -->
PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`+ neurons form relatively homogeneous group, which is comprised mainly of late-firing cells (~85%).<!-- and these neurons are predominantly described as late-firing (LF) neurons -->
These neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> following a fear conditioning protocol and thus are often referred as CeL~off~ cells. <!-- Following fear conditioning, these neurons respond to the CS with a reduction in activity and have therefore been called Ce- LOFF cells (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010). -->

In contrary, most of the PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells are SOM+.
However, those cells are classified as both late-firing (40%) or regular-spiking types (60%). <!-- może jakoś inaczej napisać -->
Moreover, these neurons respond to the fear conditioning with an increase in activity, and have, therefore, been termed CeL~ON~ neurons [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013]. 
Hence, it is plausible that these distinct populations fulfill different functional roles. <!-- We suggest that PKC␦-expressing and SOM- expressing neurons form heterogeneous populations of neurons, with different populations contributing to different behavioral outcomes. Understanding the flow of information through the CeA and its outputs, in a behaviorally specific and relevant manner, will be a challenge for future experiments. Hunt 2017-->

In addition to common GABA~A~ receptor, GABA~C-like~ receptor, insensitive to bicuculine, has been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses between ITCs and CeL neurons. <!-- moje zdanie-->
<!-- These receptors have been called GABA~C-like~ receptors due to their pharmacological similarity to retinal GABA~C~ receptors (89, 217). zmienić, cytowanie sah2003 ///  Bicuculline-insensitive receptors have also been shown to be present in the medial subdivision (239), indicating these receptors are present throughout the central nucleus. Although bicuculline-insensitive ionotropic GABA receptors have been described in other regions of the central nervous system (90), the presence of these receptors at synapses has not been shown outside the central amygdala. zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->
The two GABA receptor types appear to be localized to different GABAergic inputs onto CeL neurons.
Thus, inputs from the intercalated neurons that form synapses onto the dendrites of CeL neurons express both GABA~A~- and GABA~C~-like receptors. <!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->
These results suggest that the different GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of the central amygdala (47).<!--zmienić, cytowanie sah2003-->

It should be noted that CeA<!--, the most crucial target of BLA projections,--> is innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses on CeA neurons (@krettek_1978, @lopezdearmentia_2004, see Section \@ref(CeA)) or indirectly *via* GABAergic ITC~m~ neurons<!--explain-->, leading to feed-forward inhibition [@jngling_2008, @royer_1999].<!-- poprawić to zdanie -->

##### Connectivity
###### Afferents

<!--Although pieces of information are continually emerging, these circuit analyses reveal a rich interaction between the LA and CeL — and among neurons within the CeL — in both acquiring and expressing conditioned freezing in response to a fear cue, as well as multiple neural projections from the CeL that may regulate this behavioural response. @janak_2015-->
<!--  Moreover,  the BLA,  the  CeA,  and  their  connections  play  a  crucial  role  in  the modulation GABAergic control in the amygdala. These amygdala GABAergic  neurons  are  hence  adequately  positioned  to  play  a central  role  in  the  regulation  of  stress.  However, @jie_2018-->

As  mentioned  above,  the  GABAergic neurons  of  the  amygdala  modulate  activation  of  the  CeA  via projections from the BLA (Nuss, 2015). 

Accumulating  evidence  demonstrates that   BLA   projections   to   the   CeA   distinctly   alter   motivated behavior (Beyeler et al., 2018).

In particular, whereas LA exclusively projects to CeL, the BA nuclei additionally make synapses onto CeM neurons [@krettek_1978]. <!-- poprawić jakoś -->
Moreover, neurons in the LA preferentially make synapses onto ITC cluster located dorsally (ITC~DM~), whereas ventral medial cluster (ITC~VM~) receives input from BL and BM principal cells [@royer_2000]. <!-- poprawić i figure ... -->


The BLA was shown to form functional excitatory synapses on SOM+ and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`- cells in the CeL (CeL:SOM+), and the excitatory strength of these synapses greatly increased as a result of fear conditioning (Li 2013). 
<!-- shorten -->
A second population of CeL neurons, which is largely separate from the PKC(+) population, expresses somatostatin [somatostatin-positive (SOM+); Li et al., 2013]. 
These neurons receive direct synaptic input from the lateral amygdala, which is potentiated following auditory fear conditioning (Li et al., 2013). 
Electrophysiologically, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons which are predominantly SOM(+), have been described as either LF or regular spiking (RS). 
Following fear conditioning, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-positive neurons respond to the CS with an increase in activity, and have therefore been called CeL~ON~ neurons (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010), which likely also correspond to SOM-negative<!-- ???--> neurons (Yu et al., 2016). 

neurons in both the CeM and CeL receive glutamatergic inputs from the lateral and basal nucleus which activate both AMPA and NMDA receptors [(Royer and M de A 2004)]]. <!-- zmienić -->
Excitatory inputs to CeL neurons also express presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (186). <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
As in many other regions of the central nervous system  (132, 207), activation of these receptors leads to depression of the synaptic input. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
The activity of these receptors is modulated following kindling and chronic cocaine treatment 186 . <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->
These findings suggest that alterations in synaptic efficacy at inputs to the CeA may be involved in the changes seen in epilepsy and behavioral sensitization to cocaine. <!-- zmienić i sah2003-->

Besides their previously described inputs from either BLA or ITCs, CeA is also innervated by structures outside the amygdaloid complex. 
For example, stimulation of axons from parabrachial nucleus projecting to CeL was reported to results in suppression of appetite  [@carter_2013], suggesting that CeL has many parallel circuits. <!--CeA receives projections from BNST [@Gungor2015]-->
In mice, reducing the activity of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons was found to block decreased feeding stimulated by sickness or unpalatable tastes 58. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
Conversely, optogenetic excitation of CeL:PKCδ+ neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice, and this was not a confound of reduced activity or increased anxiety. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
These results indicate that CeL:PKCδ+ neurons suppress feeding in response to anorexigenic stimuli58. <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić -->
multiple inputs to CeL:PKCδ+ neurons that are activated by anorexigenic signals, including the BLA, the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the insula (IN)58 <!-- [@janak_2015] zmienić cytowanie do którego się odwołuje cai_2014-->

<!-- neuromodulators-->
<!-- Neurons in CeL and CeM express many neuropeptides (Gray and Magnuson 1987, 1992; Woodhams et al. 1983) that likely modulate fast inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission (Kash et al. 2015; McElligott and Winder 2009).  zmienić -->
Similar to BLA, CeA nucleus is strongly innervated<!--moze nie, skoro też ekspresjonują?--> by neuromodulators such as oxytocin <!--citations-->, dopamine <!-- citations-->, acetylocholine [@washburn_1992], norepinephrine [@faber_2002], serotonin <!--citations--> and opioids <!--citations?-->. <!-- jakoś inaczej// This picture is more complex when added a role of neuromodulators. //  more citations and figure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--> 
Specifically, hypothalamic axon terminals release oxytocin onto CeL neurons, resulting in their increased excitability [@knobloch_2012]. 
Moreover,  when these terminals are stimulated during fear conditioning, the freezing behavior is attenuated [@knobloch_2012]. <!--it leads to attenuation of freezing behavior ///  poprawić this is especially the case for.. -->

Thus, each nuclei receives unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
These findings contribute to our better understanding of functional and behavioral significance of those diverse sets of inputs to the amygdala.<!-- better written .... how specific inputs, and even genetically distinct inputs, to the amygdala regulate both behavior and local circuit activity --> 


<!-- gdzie tę końcową część umieścić? -->
The study conducted by @tye_2011 nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals <!-- or cell body --> in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals increased this behavioral phenotype. <!-- poprawić to zdanie -->
Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feed-forward inhibition of the CeM [@ciocchi_2010; @tye_2011] <!-- poprawić i brak tego cytowania @Pare2004;// BLA-cell-body activation decreased time spent by mice in the open arms of an elevated plus maze (EPM), indicating an increase in anxiety-like behaviour --> 

Thus, a glutamatergic BLA projection to the CeA can promote anxiolytic behavior. <!-- poprawić -->

when ChR2 was selectively expressed in CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons to allow their direct photoactivation, increased time in the open arms of the EPM was observed 58. <!-- cai 2014  from janak_2015-->
These data support the notion that a population of BLA neurons preferentially excites CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neurons that lead to reduced anxiety, perhaps through the projection from CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ to CeM output neurons. <!-- nie ogarniam ... -->
Alternatively, the CeL:PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`^+^ neuronal projection to the BNST, also implicated in anxiety [@kim_2013], could mediate anxiolysis. <!-- zmienić -->
These studies show that the BLA–CeA pathway does not universally promote aversive states. <!-- zmienić -->

More recently, it was found that distinct subtypes of CeL neurons contact CeM cells projecting to different brainstem sites. <!--@duvarci_2014 zmienić-->
In particular, CeM cells that project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are contacted by CeL neurons expressing oxytocin receptors (OR+), whereas CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) receive inputs from OR- CeL neurons (Viviani et al., 2011). 
It should be noted that many of the OR+ CeL neurons also express PKC<!--delta--> but not SOM and conversely for OR- CeL neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013).

It is widely accepted that the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are critical for the reward-related behaviors. Recent studies have shown that the centromedial nucleus of the amygdala (CeMA) has a distinct role in regulating reward-related behaviors. 


###### Intrinsic connectivity 

Within CeA, neurons form GABAergic synapses with each other. 

A number of recent studies shed new light on the CeL undertaking an active role in the acquisition, consolidation, and extinction of conditioned fear (  Wilensky et al., 2006  ;  Ehrlich et al., 2009  ;  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Pare and Duvarci, 2012  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). The  CeL  microcircuit  consists  of  mostly  GABA-releasing (GABAergic) inhibitory neurons with different functional and molecular features (  Cassell et al., 1999  ;  Martina et al., 1999  ;  Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004  ;  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Amano et al., 2012  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). By making reciprocal inhibitory connections, these neurons provide both feedforward and/or feedback inhibition within the CeL (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). Recent optogenetic approaches have demonstrated that intra-CeL inhibition gates CeL output and therefore controls the function of CeM and the expression of fear (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Pare and Duvarci, 2012  ). The CeL contains diverse GABAergic neuron classes, but the synaptic organization of local inhibitory circuits in this region is largely unknown. <!-- hou_2016 -->


Recent study by combining an optogenetic approach with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings<!-- in order to determine the...?--> nicely illustrated that neurons within the CeL are extensively<!--densely--> interconnected, with local connections apparent between all types of neurons, but strongest between like neurons (SOM(+) `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`SOM(+) and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+) `r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")` PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`(+))[@hunt_2017]. <!-- ZMIENIĆ JESZCZE BARDZIEJ -->
Moreover, by combining tracing, optogenetic, and electrophysiological techniques,<!--using similar approaches?--> it was demonstrated that both types of CeL neurons mainly unidirectionally project to CeM [@haubensak_2010; @jolkkonen_1998; @li_2013a; @petrovich_1997]. <!-- lepiej napisać i BRAKUJE cytowania @Cocchi2010] // substantial unidirectional connections between the CeL and the CeM (McDonald, 1982; Grove, 1988)-->
Neurons in both regions also make extensive local connections (McDonald, 1982; Sun and Cassell, 1993; Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998), with local glutamate excitation of CeL neurons evoking IPSCs in neighboring neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004). <!-- zmienić, poprawić, usunąć, zobaczyć cytowania? -->

Although both subtypes of CeL neurons inhibit one another and both project to the CeM52,53 , CeLON neurons respond to a fear CS at a shorter latency than CeLOFF52, suggesting that conditioned fear responses occur following activation of CeLON neurons that inhibit CeLOFF neurons projecting to CeM output neurons53 , thereby promoting freezing through disinhibition52,53. <!-- @janak_2015; zmienić-->

The presence of experience-dependent potentiation in the CeL indicates that this region is also important for acquisition of the CS–US association, as suggested by earlier studies17,40,52, rather than merely serving as a relay of information from the LA <!-- @janak_2015; zmienić-->

Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses. Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression. Such cell-type-specific transmission, modulation, and connectivity are likely to be critical for amygdala network function. [@hou_2016].

PKC␦(⫺) neurons inhibit PKC(⫹) neurons, which in turn project to the CeM (Haubensak et al., 2010).- Hunt2017

###### Efferents 

<!-- to add The CeA network then receives signals from the BLA and computes the inhibitory GABAergic output to various brain areas. <!-- zmienić -->
<!-- The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC), the subject of this chapter, is characterized by extensive interconnections with higher order cortical areas in the prefrontal, temporal, insular, and hippocampal cortices.--> 
In addition to complex patterns of inputs<!--?-->, amygdala has also widespread efferent projections, including both cortical and subcortical regions. <!-- jakieś review, sah odwoływał się do P... z 2000 roku, więc coś nowszego...ewentualnie sah_2003// On the output side, the targets of the amygdala are extremely diverse, however the CeM is widely accepted to be the main output nuclei.--> 
As with the majority of cells in the striatum, but in contrast to BLA, projections from the CeA are predominantly GABAergic (for a review: @sah_2003).<!-- może zmienić bardziej? -->


<!-- PAG Keeping in mind that CeA is .... -->
Specifically, CeM is the sole source of amygdala projections to the periaqueductal gray, which generates freezing (LeDoux et al. 1988), the most common index of conditioned fear. 
Moreover, CeM neurons fire at high rates during fear-inducing conditioned stimuli (Ciocchi et al. 2010; Duvarci et al. 2011), and optogenetic activation or inactivation of CeM triggers or impairs freezing, respectively (Ciocchi et al. 2010).
Other amygdala outputs thought to contribute to conditioned fear include projections to BNST (Dong et al., 2001) and various hypothalamic nuclei (Pitkanen, 2000). <!-- CEA provides an important GABAergic input to the BNST, one that has been implicated as a critical pathway in the central stress system (Jasnow et al., 2004; Walker and Davis, 2008).-->

Finally, the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon<!-- przód mózgu --> via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups (releasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline [NA], and dopamine [DA]) of the basal forebrain and brainstem (Steriade and Pare, 2007).

<!-- to raczej nie po sobie -->
Indeed, nearly all brainstem projections of the amygdala are sent from CeM (Hopkins and Holstege 1978; Petrovich and Swanson 1997; Veening et al. 1984). <!-- Indeed, CeA supplies most amygdala projections to the brainstem nuclei that generate the behavioral and visceral correlates of conditioned fear, including the PAG, parabrachial nuclei, solitary nucleus, and DVC (Hopkins and Holstege, 1978). /// Neurons from parabranchial area (PB) receives inputs from CeA [@Bester1995]  -->

Thus, multiple plastic systems, and especially those integrating GABAergic neurons, could act in concert to encode aspects of stimulus associations in the amygdala.

Inhibitory  GABAergic  neurons  project  from  the  CeA  to  the hypothalamus  and  brainstem  (Jongen-Rêlo  and  Amaral,  1998).

Imaging studies in humans and multidisciplinary work in animals collectively suggest that CeA structure and function are altered in individuals with anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder, the end result of which may be disinhibition of downstream “ effector ” regions that regulate anxiety-related and alcohol-related behaviors. 

Here, we identify and dissect a GABAergic projection that originates in the CeMA and terminates in the vmPFC (VGat-CreCeMA-vmPFC) [@seo_2016] Pathway-specific optogenetic activation of the VGat-CreCeMA-vmPFCcircuit in awake, behaving animals produced a positive, reward-like phenotype in real-time place preference and increased locomotor activity in open-field testing. In sucrose operant conditioning, the photoactivation of these terminals increased nose-poking effort with no effect on licking behavior and robustly facilitated the extinction of operant behavior. However, photoactivation of these terminals did not induce self-stimulation in the absence of an external reward. The results described here suggest that the VGat-CreCeMA-vmPFCprojection acts to modulate existing reward-related behaviors <!-- shortly - behavioral phenotype / outcome / significance in ... --> [@seo_2016]

 mPFC inhibits conditioned fear via feedforward inhibition of Ce output neurons. Recording extracellularly from physiologically identified brainstem-projecting Ce neurons, we tested the effect of mPFC prestimulation on Ce responsiveness to synaptic input. In support of our hypothesis, mPFC prestimulation dramatically reduced the responsiveness of Ce output neurons to inputs from the insular cortex and BLA. Thus, our findings support the idea that mPFC gates impulse transmission from the BLA to Ce, perhaps through GABAergic intercalated cells, thereby gating the expression of conditioned fear.

### Summary of amygdala structure and connectivity

<!--In summary, recent studies have demonstrated that the BLA–CeA circuitry is involved in a diverse array of behaviours in addition to those related to fear. 
The key to understanding the production of these different behaviours is in the functional anatomy. -->
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution [@jarvis_2005], better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.
Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enables to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- zmienć -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs, but also on their timing and origin. <!-- zmienić // ładne podsumowanie-->

### Amygdala and its crosstalk with immune system
<!-- raczej we wcześniejszym rozdziale...-->
Amygdala is considered to be an essential component of the brain circuitry that forms the neural response to systemic immune activation  [@Gaykema2007] and it is involved in sickness behavior [@Dantzer2008, @Goehler2007, @Roozendaal2009]. <!-- dodać cytowania do PhD2-->
Regarding neuroinflammation circuit, pro-inflammatory cytokines signal the brain mainly through the activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to amygdala [@Goehler2000, @Quan2008]. 
Therefore, it is important to get better insights into brain activity during acute and chronic immune responses.
Evidence from many animal studies indicates that LPS significantly increases c-fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and, to a lesser extent, in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) [@Engler2011, @Frenois2007, @Vitkovic2000]. 
Moreover, functional and neuroanatomical studies indicate that peripheral immune activation may also affect amygdala function in humans. 
For example, depressive-like symptoms and anxiety can be transiently elicited in healthy human subjects by peripheral administration of LPS [@Grigoleit2011, @Harrison2009, @Wright2005]. 
These findings suggest that in humans, similar to rodents, the amygdala is involved in the integration of behavioral and immune responses.
A recent study documented that LPS-induced anxiety in mice as well as a pronounced increase in sEPSC frequency resulting in the hyperexcitability of BLA neurons were mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@Yang2016]. 
This suggests that alterations of CXCL12 signaling in this area play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation, and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety, a key component of a sickness behavior. 
Several studies have indicated the relative abundance of a CX3CL1 receptor within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@Nishiyori1998, @Tarrozo2003], suggesting a possible influence on amygdala function. 
Although CX3CL1 also modulate synaptic activity and has been shown to modulate glutamate and GABA release in the hippocampus [@Ragozzino2006] and dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2009a], its neuromodulatory role in other brain centers remains unknown. 
Surprisingly, so far there have been no neurophysiological studies of CX3CL1 effects in the amygdala.

Furthermore, V1a  arginine-vasopressin  receptor  mRNA  was  only  found  in GABAergic neurons, demonstrated by complete co-localization of V1a transcripts in CeA neurons expressing GAD transcripts  (Hernández   et   al.,   2016).  

In extinction of auditory fear conditioning, rats learn that a tone no longer predicts the occurrence of a footshock.

The PV group includes the FS basket and chandelier cells ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). Chandelier INs, also known as axo-axonic neurons, are the most recognizable INs in terms of morphology ( DeFelipe et al., 2013 ) due to the unique candlestick-like synaptic terminal arrays they form to specifically target the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells. In contrast, the much more numerous basket cells make perisomatic ‘‘basket’’ terminals on the soma and proximal dendrites of PCs and INs. By producing hyperpolarizing and/or shunting inhibition ( Fishell and Rudy, 2011 ) close to the site of action potential generation, both types powerfully influence the output of their target neurons.

Dendritic spines on excitatory principal cells are critical sites of learning-induced plasticity.

<!-- intra-nuclear-->

 Virtually all amygdalar nuclei, including all of the BNC nuclei,have projections to the central amygdalar nucleus (CeA), which provides outputs to subcortical regions involved in various components of fear behavior (Davis, 1992;LeDoux, Iwata, Cicchetti, & Reis, 1988). The CeA does not have projections back to the BNC.
 
 The lateral ICNs, located near the external capsule, provide feedforward inhibition to BL PNs from cortical regions (Marowsky, Yanagawa, Obata, & Vogt, 2005).
 The medialICNs, located between the BL and the CeA, have reciprocal connections with BL PNs, and project to the central nucleus (Asede, Bosch, Luthi, Ferraguti, & Ehrlich, 2015;Marowsky et al., 2005).

 Anatomical data suggests that the local feedback interneurons synapse on the soma and proximal dendritic compartments of principal neurons (McDonald and Betette, 2001), whereas LPC feedforward interneurons synapse onto distal dendritic processes (Marowskyet  al, 2005; Mulleret  al, 2007). This anatomical arrangement suggests that these synapses might be functionally independent.<!-- zmienić i bardziej do ITCs czy coś... -->

<!-- NA-->
Noradrenergic innervation  synapse  onto GABAergic interneurons (Li et al., 2002). NA released from LC terminals activates three distinct classes of adrenoreceptors (AR; a 1, a 2, and ß AR) that have multiple subtypes. 
In addition to direct enhancement of inhibitory activity by LC afferents, NA enhancement of inhibitory activity in the BLA occurs indirectly. Indeed, activation of ß1 and ß3 ARs in lateral paracapsular (LPCS) interneurons, which are a distinct class of GABAergic interneurons bordering the BLA and external capsule and are thought to provide cortical feedforward inhibition to the BLA (Marowsky et al., 2005), enhances  LPCS  GABAergic  inhibition  of  the  BLA (Silberman et al., 2010, 2012)

Stimulation of afferents from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons leads to the release of ACh, which extensively  regulates  neuronal  excitability  by  acting  on muscarinic (mAChR) and nicotinic (nAChR) acetylcholine receptors, both of which are abundant in the BLA (Mash and Potter, 1986; Swanson et al., 1987; Hill et al., 1993; Zhu et al., 2005; Pidoplichko et al., 2013).

Although the BLA expresses all of mus... types of receptors (e.g., M1–M4, mAChRs, (Mash and Potter, 1986; Cortes et al., 1987; McDonald and Mascagni, 2010)), M1 mAChR is the most common subtype in the amygdala. <!-- citation? -->

The cholinergic neurons basal forebrain neurons (Carlsen et al., 1985; Zaborszky et al., 1986; Mascagni and McDonald, 2009), project primarily to dendritic shafts and spines of BLA principal neurons, and innervate PV GABAergic interneurons to a small extent ( ~ 7% of postsynaptic targets; Muller et al., 2011). 
<!-- prager 2016 -->

Activation of DA receptors has also been found to induce rhythmic inhibitory oscillations (Loretan et al., 2004; Ohshiro et al., 2011), although increases in  excitatory  transmission  are  required  to  precede GABAergic interneuronal burst firing (Ohshiro et al., 2011) <!-- zmienić i może przenieść do oscillations?-->
Although DA fibers synapse onto both GABAergic interneurons and principal neurons, there appears to be a net increase in excitatory activity within the BLA in response to DA application. <!-- zmienić i może przenieść do network ? // Here we show that dopamine gates the induction of LTP in the mouse lateral amygdala by suppressing feedforward inhibition from local interneurons. Our findings provide a cellular mechanism for the dopaminergic modulation of fear conditioning and indicate that suppression of feedforward inhibition represents a key mechanism for the induction of associative synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala. [@bissire_2003]-->
This increase in excitatory activity may be the result of 1) reduced activation of GABAergic interneurons, which occurs when activation of D2 receptors on GABAergic interneurons causes a reduction in the probability of presynaptic quantal release (Seamans et al., 2001); 2) amygdala disinhibition and the subsequent increase in excitatory activity, which may occur when DA suppresses GABA release from PV interneurons onto principal neurons but not interneurons (Chu et al., 2012); or 3) DA increasing the excitatory drive onto disinhibitory interneurons, which would subsequently increase excitatory activity (Kemppainen and Pitkanen, 2000; Bissiere et al., 2003). <!-- zmienić i może przenieść do network ?-->

In  addition, inhibition through the activation of local GABAergic interneurons is  significantly  decreased  when  dopamine  is  released  during heightened  emotional  states  (Mcdonald  et  al.,  1996;  Dallman et   al.,   2003;   Pinto   and   Sesack,   2008).  <!-- zmienić --> 


Interestingly, fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking INs displayed differential modulation by glutamate and 5-HT. <!-- zmienić -->
Furthermore, optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals did not evoke glutamate release onto BLA principal neurons, but inhibited these cells directly *via* activation of 5-HT~1A~ receptors and indirectly *via* enhanced GABA release. <!-- chyba zmienić -->
For example, by combining optogenetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, it was shown that while stimulating 5-HT terminals at low frequencies (< 1 Hz) resulted in a short-latency excitation of BLA interneurons, at higher frequencies (10–20 Hz) these cells showed both slow excitation and slow inhibition.
These findings illustrate<!-- elucidate?--> frequency-dependent, cell-type-specific control over BLA circuitry *via* 5-HT and glutamate, which often co-existed in the same neuron [@sengupta_2017]. <!-- trochę inaczej napisać --><!-- Pharmacological analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by glutamate and not 5-HT because it was abolished by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists.

In order to survive,animals must be able to discriminate dangerous stimuli from those that are safe.
Without a mechanism for learning specific stimulus-outcome relationships, fear  and  defensive  behavior  broadly generalize to many stimuli and settings. This is a maladaptive state of affairs that may underlie fear and anxiety disorders.
Under this model, the responses of BLA cells to conditioned stimuli (CSs) and the activity that drives CRs are closely related. We tested the strength of this correlation using a task where rats could emit different CRs in response to the same CSs. At odds with this model, the CS responses and CR-related activity of individual BLA cells were separable. Moreover, while the incidence of valence-coding cells did not exceed chance, at the population level there was similarity between valence coding for CSs and CRs. In fact, both lateral and basolateral neurons concurrently encoded multiple task features and behaviors. Thus, conditioned emotional behaviors may not depend on the recruitment of single cells that explicitly encode individual task variables but from multiplexed representations distributed across the BLA.@kyriasi_2018

<!-- oscillations and hippo - BLA connectivity -->
<!--  Studies in humans (  Richardson  et al., 2004  ) and rodents (  Maren and Fanselow, 1995  ) indicate  that cooperation between amygdala and hippocampus is critical  for emotional memory formation. This communication involves  the synchronization of neuronal activity at theta (  q  ) frequencies  (4–10 Hz) across the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA)  and the CA1 hippocampal field. In fear conditioning, a model of  emotional memory, animals learn to associate a negative 

 Unconditioned animals show hippocampus-related  q  oscillations in BLA at the levels of individual  principal cells and neuron populations (as reflected in local field  potentials, LFPs) (  Pare   ́  and Gaudreau, 1996  ). Amplitude and  power of this rhythm increase after auditory, contextual or social  fear learning (  Jeon et al., 2010; Pare   ́  and Collins, 2000; Seiden-  becher et al., 2003  ). Moreover, the degree of  q  synchrony  between BLA and CA1 after fear conditioning predicts memory  performance (  Popa et al., 2010  ). Precise timing of activity in the  BLA is likely important not only for oscillations. It may also be critical for memory encoding, by selectively assigning emotional  valence to incoming sensory stimuli. [@bienvenu_2012]-->
