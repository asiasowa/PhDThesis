# Introduction

## Chemokines

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins. 
They  were originally identified as serving chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins. 
So far, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized <!--<http:// cytokine.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/>. not active link, find another database or use @Li2008a-->. 
They can be classified into CXC, CC, C or CX3C subfamilies based on the arrangement of the two cysteine residues near the N-terminus [@Zlotnik2000] \ref{family}.

![ *Chemokine families.* Chemokines are classified in four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys – cysteine residue, X – amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines. \label{family} ](images\chemokinefamilies.png) 

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface receptors that belong to the superfamily of seven-membrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are expressed in a wide variety of cells [@Bacon2000a]. 
Studies indicate that chemokines and their receptors interact with each other in a complex manner. 
There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction [@Howard1996].
Moreover, after interaction with chemokines, some receptors undergo dimerization (heterodimerization, homodimerization) and oligomerization process, which seems to be critical for the triggering of biological responses [@Mellado2001].

Chemokines were originally identified as serving chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins. 
Of particular interest is the idea that central nervous system (CNS) chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation, but also function as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in the brain [@Adler2005]. 
Like those systems, the chemokine system is widely but unevenly distributed in the brain and has both ligands and receptors expressed in neurons. 
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? 
The plausible explanation is that they may provide a bridge between the immune and nervous systems, which are classically viewed as two complex and distinct entities.

In CXC (also known as α) chemokines (see figure, part a), one amino acid separates the first two
cysteine residues (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC). Chemokines of this family are known to chemoattract neutrophils, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. In CC (also known as β) chemokines (see figure, part b), the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other. Members of this chemokine family chemoattract monocytes, macrophages, basophils, T lymphocytes and eosinophils, but have little or no effect on neutrophils. The C (also known as γ) chemokine subfamily (see figure, part c) is distinguished structurally as containing only two of the four conserved cysteine residues that are found in the other families. The only members of this family are lymphotactin α and β (XCL1 and XCL2), which are known to chemoattract T lymphocytes. These chemokines are specific ligands for the XCR1 receptor. The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine subfamily, which is currently represented by a single member named fractalkine (CX3CL1), is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see figure, part d) - Rostene2007

although we focus on the two chemokines that have been extensively described in the CnS and for which the most data are avail- able, we also report on other chemokines that are active in the CnS. The chemokines that we mainly focus on belong to the two main chemokine families; they are the CC chemok- ine CCl2 (also known as monocyte chemoat- tractant protein 1 (mCP1)) and its cognate receptor, CCr2, and the CXC chemokine CXCl12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)) and its receptor in rodents (which is, as far as is known to date, unique in these species), CXCr4. - Rostene2007

Interestingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of a chemokine and its receptor (see below and FIG. 1) overlap in many regions in the normal adult brain. This suggests that these chemokines, through the action on specific GPCrs, might be involved in local neuronal communication.

The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission. 
Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release [@Limatola2000, @Ragozzino2002], modulate the functional properties of ionic channels [@Lax2002, @Oh2002] and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes [@Lax2002]. 
In addition, the chemokine system can alter the actions of neuronally active pharmacological agents such as opioids and the cannabinoid system [@Heinisch2011]. 
Moreover, chemokine receptor knockout mice (CCR6, CCR7, CXCR5) have recently been shown to exhibit behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes of relevance to psychiatric disorders, which suggests their essential role in physiological conditions [@Harrison2014, @Jaehne2014, @Stuart2014].

In this thesis, CXCL12 and CX3CL1 and their receptors (CXCR4, CXCR7, CX3CR1) have been investigated, as they are both expressed constitutively, even in physiological conditions, throughout the CNS [@Banisadr2002a, @Hesselgesser1999, @Schonemeier2008].
