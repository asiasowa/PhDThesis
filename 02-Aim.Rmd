# Aim of the study

Considering described evidence, this dissertation aimed to investigate the modulation of two amygdalar subdivisions, namely BLA and CeA, by two chosen chemokines. 
I focused on CXCL12 and CX3CL1, as they, together with their receptors, were implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, synaptic transmission, neuroimmune responses, and glial regulation.
Moreover, dysfunctions in their signaling were reported to share similar characteristics as those in the amygdala.
To better understand chemokines' modulation at the network level of the whole complex of amygdala, both the main input nucleus (the basolateral complex) and the main output nucleus (the central complex) were investigated.

Briefly, receptors of CXCL12 and CX3CL1 chemokines are located in the amygdala (see Section: \@ref(chemokinesexpress)); however, their specific distribution is not thoroughly examined. 
Thus, the first aim of this dissertation was to investigate fully... 

Functionally, previous studies have demonstrated complex electrophysiological effects of CXCL12 and CX3CL1, which differ in relation to, for instance, the brain region or neuronal population (see Section: \@ref(chemokineselectro)). <!--and these effect are summarized in section/table?/ -->
Moreover, at least some of those effects were mediated by glial cells.
Accordingly, this dissertation further aimed to dissect the ... <!--- jakoś ładnie opisać --> 

The central hypotheses of the research presented here are: 

1.  Chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed in the BLA and/or CeA in both neuronal and glial cells.

2. Chemokines directly and/or indirectly *via* glial modulation alter neuronal membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and/or central nuclei of the amygdala.

Therefore,<!-- based on different nuclei of the amygdala and different chemokine axes,--> this project can be sub-divided into four separate but physiologically and functionally related parts (see Fig. ..).

1. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat basolateral nucleus of the amygdala.

2. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat central nucleus

3. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CXCL12 and their receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, in the rat basolateral nucleus

4. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CXCL12 and their receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, in the rat central nucleus

To address these issues, mainly whole-cell patch-clamp and immunofluorescent techniques were employed. <!-- several research techniques were employed: whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular recordings *ex vivo*, immunofluorescent staining and <!--dendritic spines--><!-- // Considering described evidence and proposed hypotheses, the present studies were focused on two separate but physiologically and functionally related subjects:  /// 4 major groups of experiment --><!--Detailed aims and hypotheses addressed in each study, as well as techniques used are listed below.

Precisely, to determine the distribution of chemokines (CXCL12/CX3CL1) or chemokine receptors (CXCR4, ACKR3, and CX3CR1) in relation to the cell type in the chosen amygdalar nuclei (BLA/CeA), their co-localization in different cell types (neurons, microglia, astrocytes) was examined.
Coronal rat brain slices containing the BLA and CeA were selected and immunohistochemically processed using specific primary antibodies for NeUN, IBA, GFAP, and for the chemokine or chemokine receptor of interest. <!-- dodać markery-->
Fluorescent microscopy was utilized to investigate and quantify co-localization throughout the amygdala. <!--   (Appendix A)  .     -->

Next, to examine the membrane properties and synaptic transmission of BLA and CeA neurons in brain slices and their sensitivity to chosen chemokine application, *in vitro*  whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in rat brain slices containing the amygdala. 
BLA or CeA neuron membrane properties, spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (sEPSC/mEPSC/sIPSC/mIPSC) were collected before and after bath application of chosen chemokines.
