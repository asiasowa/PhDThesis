The amygdala, as an essential hub in the brain, integrating information about external and internal environment, is an important player in homeostasis, and mediate a diverse array of functions. 
Consistently, malfunctions in amygdala circuits have been suggested to underlie many disorders (addition, fear, epilepsy, obesity, pain, ...). <!-- dokończyć-->

Thus, this dissertation aimed to investigate the the modulation of two amygdalar circuits, namely basolateral and central nuclei, by two chosen chemokines.
I focused on the CXCL12 and CX3CL1 chemokines <!--axes?--> as they are implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, synaptic transmission, neuroimmune responses, glial regulation, and dysfunctions of their axis were reported to share similar characteristics as those in amygdala. <!-- NAC modulates antioxidant, glutamatergic, inflammatory and neurotrophic pathways in the central nervous system, all of which are relevant to anxiety pathology. -->

The central hypotheses of the research study are: 

1.  Chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed in the BLA and/or CeA in both neuronal and glial cells.

2. Chemokines directly and/or indirectly *via* glial modulation alter neuronal membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and/or central nuclei of the amygdala.

Therefore, based on different nuclei of amygdala and different chemokine axes, this project can be sub-divided into four separate, but physiologically and functionally related, parts (see Fig. ..).

1. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat basolateral nucleus of the amygdala.

2. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat central nucleus

3. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CXCL12 and their receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, in the rat basolateral nucleus

4. Investigation of electrophysiological actions and cellular distribution of CXCL12 and their receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, in the rat central nucleus

To address these issues, mainly whole-cell patch-clamp and immunofluorescent techniques were employed. <!-- several research techniques were employed: whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular recordings *ex vivo*, immunofluorescent staining and <!--dendritic spines--><!-- // Considering described evidence and proposed hypotheses, the present studies were focused on two separate but physiologically and functionally related subjects:  /// 4 major groups of experiment -->

To determine the distribution of chemokines or chemokine receptors in relation to cell type in the chosen amygdalar nuclei, the   co-localization of chemokines (CXCL12 and CX3CL1) and chemokine   receptors (CXCR4, ACKR3, and CX3CR1)   in  different cell types (neurons, microglia, astrocytes)  present in the amygdala (BLA and CeA) was examined.
Coronal rat brain slices containing the BLA and CeA were selected and immunohistochemically processed using specific primary antibodies for NeUN, IBA, GFAP, and for the chemokine  or chemokine receptor of interest. <!-- dodać markery-->
Fluorescent   microscopy  was utilized to investigate and quantify  co-localization throughout the amygdala. <!--   (Appendix A)  .     -->

To examine the membrane properties and  synaptic transmission of BLA and CeA neurons in brain slices, and their sensitivity to chosen chemokine application, *in vitro*     whole  -  cell   patch  -  clamp   recordings  were performed in rat brain slices containing the amygdala. 
BLA or CeA neuron membrane properties, spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (sEPSC/mEPSC/sIPSC/mIPSC) were collected before and after bath application of chosen chemokines. 
Additionally,

<!-- Preludium

There are four main objectives of proposed project:
A. Determination of the distribution of fractalkine (CX3CL1) and SDF-1α (CXCL12) immunoreactivity, as
well as the location of the corresponding receptors (CX3CR1, CXCR4) in relation to different neural populations
of the rat basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) amygdala.
B. Description of the physiological effects of CXCL12 or CX3CL1 on excitability and basal synaptic
transmission in different neuronal populations of the basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) amygdala.
C. Analysis of the possible modulatory effect of CXCL12 or CXC3CL1 corticosterone-induced changes in
neuronal excitability and basal synaptic transmission in the basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) amygdala.
D. Investigation of the CXCL12 or CX3CL1 involvement in the modulation of cortical and thalamic inputs
into the BLA, including short-term synaptic plasticity.
The hypotheses are as following:
a. application of CXCL12 in the BLA will result in the increased excitatory drive of BLA principal neurons
(80% of neurons are excitatory in this structure). This will in turn increase the excitatory drive of the CeA, thereby
enhancing the inhibitory output from the amygdala (the overwhelming majority of CeA neurons is GABAergic).
Application of CXCL12 directly in the CeA will as well result in increase in excitatory drive of neurons there.
b. application of CX3CL1 in the BLA will result in the decrease excitatory drive of BLA principal neurons,
which will in turn decrease the excitatory drive of the CeA, thereby abolishing the inhibitory output from the
amygdala. Application of CX3CL1 directly in the CeA will as well result in decrease in the excitatory drive of
neurons there.
c. Corticosterone administration/injections will enhance the excitatory drive of BLA and CeA principal cells,
which will be modulated by chemokine application, mainly enhanced by CXCL12 and decreased by CX3CL1.
However, principal cell axons projecting from the BLA to the CeA also have collaterals ending in the intercalated
GABAergic cell clusters between the two structures. Therefore, it will be tested whether application of
CXCL12/CX3CL1 results in net excitation or inhibition of principal neurons in the CeA. There is also the
possibility of tonic CX3CL1/CXCL12 activity within the amygdala due to their constitutive expression by neurons
and glia. This will be examined by recording synaptic activity before and after application of selective
antibodies/receptor antagonists.
Detailed description of electrophysiological effects of these compounds in control/corticosterone conditions in the 
BLA and CeA parts of amygdala will bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying the interaction
of stress and immune signaling in the central nervous system and neural circuitry. This will greatly contribute to
our understanding of neuroimmunoendocrinological mechanisms governing the central nervous system response
to stress, and raise the possibility of uncovering new neurochemical targets for future therapeutic evaluation -->

6 Aim of the study
Considering described evidence and proposed hypotheses the present studies were focused on two separate but physiologically and functionally related subjects:
• Investigation of the RLN3/RXFP3 signalling in the rat PVN as a putative neuronal mechanism of RLN3 orexigenic action: its characteristics, potential sex differences possibly responsible for stronger orexigenic effect of RLN3 in female rats and its involvement in binge eating behaviour.
• Investigation of MNCs in the rat PVN: their characteristics and potential sex differences possibly shaping sex-specific roles of OXT, AVP and RLN3 peptides.
To address these issues several research techniques were employed: patch-clamp recordings ex vivo, single-cell reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (scRT-PCR), immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining, neural tract tracing and behavioural testing using a model of binge eating behaviour combined with intra-PVN microinjections.
Initial part of studies aimed at the characterisation of RLN3/RXFP3 signalling in the PVN was carried out on Wistar rats. Due to the relative resistance to binge eating behaviour displayed by this rat strain (161) and common use of Sprague Dawley rats in studies on the RLN3 orexigenic effect (51, 52, 56, 61, 63), the experiments on potential sex differences in PVN RLN3/RXFP3 signalling as well as PVN neuron characteristics focused on Sprague Dawley rats.
Detailed research objectives addressed in each study, as well as techniques used are listed below:
1. RLN3/RXFP3 signalling in the rat PVN:
• Investigation of the influence of native RLN3 and high affinity, selective RXFP3 receptor agonist – RXFP3 analogue 2 (RXFP3-A2) on the electrophysiology of identified PVN neurons as well as related potential sex differences – ex vivo patch-clamp in male Wistar rats and male and female Sprague Dawley rats
• Investigation of the influence of RXFP1 agonist – H2 on electrophysiology of identified PVN neurons – ex vivo patch-clamp in male Wistar rats
• Pharmacological verification of the type of G protein involved in transduction of RXFP3-mediated effects in the PVN neurons – ex vivo patch-clamp in male Wistar rats
