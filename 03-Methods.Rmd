### Ethic approval

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15 January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal Research (Krakow, Poland). 
All efforts were made to minimize suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

### Animals

Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Research Models and Services; Germany).<!-- Po dostawie zwierzęta przechodziły kilkudniową adaptację do warunków pomieszczenia hodowlanego -->
Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm) lined with wooden bedding in controlled environment (22 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, 45 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 5 % relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) with commercial food and fresh water *ad libitum*. 
Animals were acclimated to the housing environment for at least 4 days before the beginning of the experiments. 
For the patch-clamp experiments 4-7-week old male Wistar, as well as 6-8- week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were used. For the immunohistochemical experiments 8-10-week-old male Wistar, as well as 3-4-month-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were used.
For patch-clamp experiments, rats weighing 180-300g (5-10 weeks of age) were used.
For immunostaining experiments, rats weighing 300-350 g were used.
<!-- zwierzęta na hodowle? -->
Animals at this age are considered as young adults. 
The age of the animals for each experiment was determined to assure credible and interpretable results.

## Electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices {#electromethod}
<!-- może jakieś zdanie, że to measure .... -->
### Tissue preparation for electrophysiological experiments {#decap}

Male Wistar (4-7-week-old) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m. 
Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal–fluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO~3~, 1.4 NaH~2~PO~4~, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl~2~, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O~2~/5% CO~2~), pH 7.4; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and cut into 300 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for patch-clamp experiments and  400 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for extracellular recordings on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). 
After slicing, brain slices containing amygdala were transfered and held in an incubation chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^). 
Slices were incubated at 31–33`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT).
After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of an Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min) with carbogenated, warm (32`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^).


### Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition {#patchclampmethod}
<!-- zrobić zdjęcia z DIC i miejscem -->
Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC). 
The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD camera and displayed on a computer monitor. 
The border of the basolateral or central amygdala were identified based on visual control by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos Atlas [@paxinos_2006], corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal to bregma (see Figure: \@ref(fig:methodpatch)). <!-- lepszy figure --> 
Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. 
Cells were approached under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland). 
Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (3–6 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`; Sutter Instruments, USA) using horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments P–97) and filled with following solutions. 

```{r methodpatch, fig.cap='...', fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, message= FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("images/zdjeciedic40x.png")
```
 
For experiment measuring excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability, the intrapippete solution contained (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl~2~, 2 MgCl~2~, 5 Na~2~ATP, 0.4 Na~3~GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, osmolarity 290-300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and biocytin (0.1%, for subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). 
For experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na~2~, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 280-290 mOsmol kg^−1^.

The pipette was positively pressurized by applying a mouth suction to help prevent contamination of the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity of the membrane keeping a positive pressure. 
After forming a high-resistance seal (> 1 G`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`, cell-attached configuration) between the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure, a second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of membrane enclosed with the pipette's tip and access inside of the neuron. 
An electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode was established (whole-cell configuration). 
After break-in, cells stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly diffuses from the pipette into cytoplasm.
Ground electrode, which was chloride-coated silver wire in chamber filled with bath solution, kept the electrical potential of the outer side of cell membrane at 0 mV. 
Electrical potential of the inner side of cell membrane was controlled through an patch electrode filled with intrapipette solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4 Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA). 
Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20kHz and sampled through an analogue-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, USA). 
Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA). 
All membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential (estimated as `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`12 mV). <!-- Voltages were corrected for liquid junction potential ( $\sim$ 11 mV).-->
The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. 
Only recordings with stable access resistance lower than 30 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")` were considered acceptable for analysis. 
All drugs were delivered *via* a bath perfusion system. <!-- antibodies? -->
<!--  Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.// The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.-->


### Electrophysiological identification and classification of chosen neurons
<!-- właściwie nie ruszone... -->
Once the whole-cell recording was obtained, cell characteristics were recorded using current-clamp techniques.
<!-- In order to characterize the electrophysiological features of SuM and PH neurons, we measured the following parameters in response to hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (5pA steps, 500ms) according to Petilla terminology [@ascoli_2008; @karagiannis_2009; @gouwens_2019]:-->
Neurons were identified by location, shape of cell body, firing properties, and morphology

#### Electrophysiological identification of neurons in the CeA

<!-- to bardziej do analizy.... 
Based on their response to somatic current injections, three general types of CeL neurons have previously been described, with the two major types being LF neurons, which show a significant delay before onset of the first AP (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`100–200 ms), and early-spiking (ES) neurons (also described as regular-spiking; AP onset, `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`50 ms). 
A third, smaller population of low-threshold bursting neurons has also been described (Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004; Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). 
We characterized the firing properties of 151 CeL neurons. 
However, while classifying neurons we found that AP onset varied with changes in holding potential, whereas the presence of spike frequency accommodation was more reliable. 
Using this measure, neurons were classified either as nonaccommodating (NA), where AP frequency remained relatively consistent (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`17 Hz), or accommodating (Ac), where there was clear spike frequency adaptation (AP1-2, `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`2 Hz; AP7-8, 13 Hz; p < 0.001 Wilcoxon matched-pairs test; Fig. 2C). 
The large majority of our neurons were nonaccommodating (n = 80 neurons; Fig. 2A) or accommodating (n = 59 neurons; Fig. 2B). 
Nonaccommodating neurons also had a significantly longer mean onset compared with that of accommodating neurons (Table 1), and these neurons generally corresponded to the LF and ES types (Hauben- sak et al., 2010; Amano et al., 2012). 
Thus, for consistency we have termed these LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons. 
Apart from resting membrane potential, which was significantly more depolarized in ES-Ac neurons, other membrane properties such as input resistance, threshold potential, AP amplitude, rise time, and half-width did not differ significantly between LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons -Hunt2017 -->

<!--## Clustering

Hierarchical clustering analysis. 
To classify the cells, an unsupervised clustering analysis ( Cauli et al., 2000 ; Jasnow et al., 2009 ; Sosulina et al., 2010 ) was performed by using squared Euclidean distances and Ward’s method ( Ward, 1963 ).
Electrophysiological properties of CeL cells were tested for uniformity in their distributions. 
Each of the quantified 14 variables (listed in Table 1)  was binned and tested by the D’Agostino– Pearson normality test, which is based on the assumption that a variable is normally distributed in a class.  
Variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were used for subsequent unsupervised clustering. 
Hierarchical clustering arranges data items into a tree-like dendrogram in which tree leaves represent data items and the length of tree edges between leaves represents the dissimilarity between data items. 
Tree leaves belonging to a subtree suggest high similarity and therefore form a group. 
Hierarchical clustering operates as follows. 
First, each CeL neuron was transformed into a 4D data point with variables of spike delay, ramp ratio, resting membrane potential (RMP), and rheobase. 
Before clustering, we first normalized variables into the range (0, 1) by performing min–max normalization. The distance between data points represents the dissimilarity between them; closer data points have higher similarity. 
Next, we clustered all the data points by the following iterative procedure. First, assign each data point to a cluster; every cluster therefore contains only one data point. 
Second, merge the two closest clusters into one cluster; therefore, Hou et al., 2016 -->

### Recording protocols and data analysis

Whole-cell patch-clamp is capable of detecting transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration, or measuring membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration.
The frequency-current (F/I) relationship was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a linear regression model. <!-- dodać że at -65mV /// The input-output relationship was obtained for each neuron using hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms). 
The frequency-current (F/I) relationship was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude.-->
The gain (slope) and rheobase (minimal current necessary to fire the first action potential) parameters was determined for further analysis.
<!-- + Tomek? -->

In order to evaluate cell excitability, the input-output relationship was obtained for each neuron using hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms, 5pA increments). 
Then the series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses (500ms, from -80 to 100pA in 5pA increments) were injected.
Action potentials were evoked in current clamp mode from a holding potential of -65 mV by 500 ms depolarizing current pulses.
For each neuron, several electrophysiological parameters were measured according to the Petilla terminology [@ascoli_2008; @karagiannis_2009].
To take into account the possible variety of firing patterns, such as bursting, adapting, regular or irregular trains of action potentials, the interspaced intervals were measured for response to the the minimal current injection eliciting more than three action potentials and the following parameters were measured:
Voltage responses of neurons induced by 500 ms hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses were measured as described previously (Vucurovic et al., 2010; Perrenoud et al., 2012). <!-- nasze cytowania i inaczej--> 
In order to characterize the behavior of recorded neurons, several electrophysiological parameters were measured, as follows: 
(1) the resting membrane potential (RMP), <!--was recorded immediately after establishing whole-cell configuration.-->
(2) Input resistance (R~m~) and 
(3) the membrane time constant `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C4")`~m~ (determined at the beginning of the voltage response of a hyperpolarization current pulse of 10 pA; the time constant was determined by fitting this voltage response to a single exponential), 
(4) the membrane capacitance (C~m~; calculated according to the equation C~m~= $\frac{\tau~m~}{R~m~}$), 
(5) action potential threshold (corresponded to the voltage threshold of the first action potential elicited by a current step, defined as the voltage at which the time derivative of V~m~($\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}$) is 20 V s^−1^), 
(6) The rheobase (the minimal depolarizing current pulse intensity that elicited an action potential), 
(7) the first spike latency (measured at rheobase as the time needed to elicit the first action potential),
(8) amplitudes of the first and (9) second action potential (AP; measured from the threshold to the positive peak of the rheobase), 
(10) AP width (measured at half-amplitude<!--measured at the threshold of action potentials and spike amplitude from the threshold to the peak.-->), 
(11) maximal firing rate (F~max~, defined as the trace with the largest number of action potentials), 
(12) the amplitude of the fast after-hyperpolarization (AHP~f~; measured for the first spike), 
(13a) the presence of post-inhibitory rebound, 
(13b) its amplitude, 
(13c) duration and 
(13d) the number of AP elicited by a post-inhibitory rebound following hyperpolarizing current of 80 pA from -65 mV, 
(14a) the occurrence of spontaneous firing, 
(14b) its frequency, 
(14c) amplitude, and 
(14d) coefficient variance (CV).
When neurons did not exhibit some of the abovementioned features, they were arbitrarily set to 0.
<!-- Therefore, the amplitude (21–24) and the latency (25–28) of the first (AHPf) and second (AHPs) components of afterhyperpolarization was measured for the first two action potentials as the difference between spike threshold and the negative peak of the AHP (Kawaguchi, 1993). 
In some cortical neurons (Haj-Dahmane and Andrade, 1997), this complex repolarization is accompanied by a fast afterdepolarization (ADP). 
Its (29, 30) amplitude and (31, 32) latency were measured as the difference between the negative peak of the AHPf and the positive peak of the ADP and between the spike threshold and the peak of the ADP, respectively. When neurons did not exhibit AHPs or ADP, amplitude and latency were arbitrarily set to 0. @karagiannis_2009-->

### Synaptic transmission 

IHC was performed automated with image analysis software to exclude any bias and to be blinded.

The slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, washed in PBS,<!--resectioned to 50-μm thickness,--> and processed for GFAP and NeuN immunoreactivity.
Z-stacks of images with an optical distance of 0.5 μm were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510) using a 40× oil-immersion objective. 
Secondary antibodies tagged to fluorescein 488 and Cy3 were excited with 488- and
594- nm lasers and observed through 510–530 and 560–615 emission filters, respectively. 
A pinhole of 1 Airy unit and identical settings for the detector gain and amplifier offset were used to capture all confocal images 

To overcome this problem, we adapted a protocol for application of the red fluorescent dye SR101, which was reported to stain astrocytes in the intact cortex of rodents ( Nimmerjahn et al., 2004 ), for use in acute slices of the rat hippocampus. 
SR101 is excited around 575 nm and its emission can be collected above 590 nm, making it suitable for use in combination with many available ion-selective dyes. 
Initial experiments were carried out employing a post-incubation with SR101-containing ACSF at room temperature for 20 min. 
Independent from the SR101 concentration used (from 100 M – as suggested by Nimmerjahn et al. (2004) for in vivo experiments – down to 0.5 M), this protocol resulted in an unspecific surface label of SR101. 
The vast majority of the unspecific SR101 staining most likely represented a nuclear label of superficial neurons whereas cells with typical astrocytic morphology were not stained (not shown). 
In stark contrast to this, we found that incubation of the slices right after their preparation in ACSF containing 500 nM–1 M SR101 for 20 min at high temperature (34◦C), resulted in a highly specific staining of cells with astrocytic morphology that was maintained for more than 8 h. 
The staining pattern of SR101 in slices obtained from animals at postnatal day 3 (P3, Fig. 1 A), P7 (not shown), P15 ( Fig. 1 B), as well as P24–27 (not shown) excluded virtually all cells of the stratum pyramidale , clearly indicating that SR101 exclusively labeled glial cells throughout development in this preparation @kafitz_2008

A subset of slices was treated with 100 μ M FC for at least 30 min at room temperature. 
For SR101 staining, slices were incubated in 1 μ M SR101 in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for 20 min, washed in control ACSF for at least 10 min at 34 °C, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry. [@christian_2013]

<!-- For determination of the amount of SR101-positive cells on the total number of cells exhibiting glial morphology, slices were double-labeled with SR101 and the ester form of sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI), a conventional Na+-selective fluorescent dye that exhibits similar properties as Fura-2 ( Meier et al., 2006 ). 
To this end, SBFI-AM (800 M) was repeatedly (1–5 s duration each) pressure-injected through a fine-tipped glass microelectrode into the stratum radiatum ( Stosiek et al., 2003 ). 
Injection was followed by a 45–60 min wash in normal ACSF at room temperature to allow for diffusion and de-esterification of the dye. 
Stacks of images (31 optical sections at 1 or 1.5 m thickness) were then taken at a custom build two-photon laser scanning microscope (excitation wavelength at 850 nm) based on an Olympus FV300 system (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany), coupled to a Mai-Tai Broadband laser (Spectra Physics, Darmstadt, Germany) and equipped with two fluorescence detection channels. 
Fluorescence emission of SBFI was collected between 400 and 590 nm, emission of SR101 was detected between 610 and 630 nm. 
Maximum intensity projections and analyses of the staining patterns were performed at montages of image stacks using “ImageJ”software. @kafitz_2008-->
<!-- Following sectioning, slices were kept at 34◦C for 20 min in ACSF that contained 0.5–1 M sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), followed by a 10 min incubation in normal ACSF at 34◦C. 
Preparation of slices from animals older than 15 days as well as their incubation with SR101 at high temperature was performed in ACSF with a reduced Ca2+ concentration (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2and 5% CO2; pH 7.4).

### Extracellular recording and LTP <!-- Field potential recordings -->

<!-- to results -->
As the BLA is widely known to be involved in emotional learning and memory, and mounting evidence points to CX3CL1 as a crucial player in these phenomena, additional experiments investigating the role of CX3CL1 in the BLA LTP was performed <!-- poprawić Albo prościej, Additional electrophysiological experiments were performed -->
Slices containing the BLA were transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a recording ACSF (33.5 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 0.5`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C), the same as for patch-clamp recordings. <!-- Slices were transferred to an interface chamber that was continually perfused with ACSF at a rate of 1 to 2 ml/min.-->
<!-- Recordings began approx. 2.5 h after slice preparation. --> 


The microelectrode tips were visually positioned in the basolateral region of the amygdala (between the EC and the bed nucleus of the stria terminals) under a dissecting microscope. <!-- FIG -->
Field potentials (FPs) were evoked by stimulation (0.016 Hz, pulse duration: 200 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`s) employing a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (WPI) and a bipolar Pt-Ir electrode (CBARC85, FHC) placed in the external capsule. <!-- Potencjały polowe wywoływano prostokątnymi impulsami elektrycznymi o natężeniu w zakresie 0– 100 A i czasie trwania 0,2 ms, podawanymi z częstotliwością 0,016 Hz. // the external or internal capsule to activate cortico-amygdalar or thalamo-amygdalar connections respectively [20] .-->
FPs were recorded using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–2 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U03A9")`).<!-- Rejestracje potencjałów polowych dokonywano za pomocą szklanej mikroelektrody wypełnionej ACSF, o oporności 1 – 2 M Ohm, w której umieszczano srebrny drut pokryty chlorkiem srebra.-->
Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a  List-Medical L/M 3P-A micropipette puller. <!-- Elektrody szklane wykonywano z kapilar szklanych, przy użyciu wyciągarki do mikroelektrod. -->
The recording electrode was introduced 150`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m into the slice within the BLA.<!-- Elektrodę umieszczono w skrawku na głębokości około 150 m w stosunku do powierzchni, w obrębie AMG-// Glass microelectrodes (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) were filled with ACSF (tip resistances 1 M Ω ) and placed in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region to record population spikes (PS). --> 
<!-- Elektrodę odniesienia stanowił, umieszczony w komorze doświadczalnej, drucik srebrny pokryty chlorkiem srebra. -->
Signals <!--FPs--> were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, USA), filtered (1-500 Hz), A/D converted at 10 kHz, and stored using the Micro1401 interface and SIGAVG software (CED, UK). <!-- FPs were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA, USA), A/D converted at 10 kHz, and stored using the Micro1401 interface and Signal 4 software (CED, Cambridge, UK). // Hippocampal and cortical responses underwent amplification (EXT 10–2F amplifier, NPI), filtration (1 Hz–1 kHz), A/D conversion (10-kHz sampling rate, Axon Instruments), and then were saved on PC using the Micro1401 interface, and Signal 4 software (CED)./// Rejestrowaną różnice potencjałów, po tysiąckrotnym wzmocnieniu i odfiltrowaniu sygnału w zakresie częstotliwości 1 - 500 Hz (Axoprobe, Axon Instruments USA) rejestrowano na komputerze z zastosowaniem przetwornika analogowo cyfrowego CED 1401 mkII (CED Co. UK) i oprogramowania SIGAVG (CED Co. UK).-->

At the beginning of each experiment, <!-- Na początku doświadczenia dla każdego badanego skrawka określano zależność amplitudy odpowiedzi od intensywności bodźca (tzw. krzywą wejście-wyjście) w kontrolnym płynie inkubacyjnym (ACSF). -->

A stimulus–response (input–output) curve was obtained for each slice.<!-- Dla każdego badanego skrawka konstruowano krzywą wejście-wyjście, czyli  zależność wielkości odpowiedzi od siły stymulacji. Parametrem określającym wielkość fEPSP był amplituda potencjału polowego. -->
For that purpose stimulation intensity was progressively elevated step-wise (16 steps; 0–100 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`A). <!-- The input/output (I/O) response curves were constructed by varying the intensity of single-pulse stimulation (interstimulus interval: 10 s; pulse duration: 100 μ s) and averaging 6 responses for each intensity. The time interval between the consecutive increases in stimulation strength was 20 s. 
To evaluate short-term synaptic interactions, paired-pulse stimuli were delivered with interstimulus intervals ranging from 10 to 500 ms and averaging 6 responses for each time interval, altogether lasting 12 min. -->
In all experiments baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of sufficient intensity <!--(300 e 800mA)--> to elicit a response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field potentials, which was fixed at this level throughout the experiment. <!--In all experiments baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of sufficient intensity (300 e 800mA) to elicit a response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field potentials.  /// One response was documented for each stimulation intensity. // Then, the responses of 30% of the maximum amplitude were generated by adjusting stimulation intensity.// The stimulus was adjusted to elicit a PS at 30% of the maximal response, which was fixed at this level throughout the experiment. -->
<!-- 
TBS was delivered at the same intensity and pulse duration as the test stimuli during establishment of the baseline responses. 
Evoked field potentials at the baseline intensity were recorded from the BLA for up to 60 min following the application of TBS. 
The results are presented as the mean of each 5 min period to give 12 time points. 
LTP was defined as an increase in the amplitude of the fPSPs. Changes in fPSP amplitude were measured for each rat as a percentage of change from its baseline.-->

<!-- LTP induction-->
The LTP was induced applying theta burst stimulation (TBS). <!-- Next, after 15 min of baseline recording LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) composed of 5 series of 10 trains of pulses delivered at 5 Hz. Each train consisted of eight pulses delivered at 100 Hz. TBS was repeated three times every 5 min. --><!-- LTP indukowano wykorzystując Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS): 5 seriamii 10 bodźców częstotliwości 100 Hz, trwającymi 0,2 s, powtórzonymi pięciokrotnie co 25 s. --><!-- To induce LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar electrode placed on the surface of the slice and recorded population spikes (PS) in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area by theta burst stimulation (TBS) consisting of two sets of five theta bursts separated by 30 s (2 × 5 TBS) with each burst involving four pulses at 100 Hz delivered at an interval of 200 ms. ///  Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. -->
It consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz, repeated 5 times every 15 s. 
Each train consisted of five pulses at 100 Hz. 
During TBS, pulse duration was extended to 0.3 ms. 
<!-- Następnie potencjały polowe rejestrowano przez 60 minut (0.016Hz). -->
<!-- Ostanie 15 minut pomiaru było brane pod uwagę w obliczeniach LTP -->
The amount of LTP was assessed in terms of an average increase in the amplitude of responses recorded between 60 and 75 min after the last burst, relative to baseline (the first 15 min of recording).<!--  /// Intensywność stymulacji ustalano tak, aby wielkość rejestrowanych potencjałów stanowiła 30 % ich maksymalnej amplitudy. // Stimulus intensities for recording baseline fEPSPs were adjusted to have slopes that were 50% of the maximum.

<!-- Stosowano impulsy o natężeniu około 20 μA.  -->
The health of the slice was monitored by continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout experiments. 


For FP recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC) was placed approx.  2 mm lateral to the midline and approx.  1.5 mm below the pial surface (in layer V). Stimuli (duration: 0.2 ms) were applied at 0.033 Hz using a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (WPI). FPs were recorded using glass micropipettes filled with ACSF (1–2 MW), which were placed approx. 0.3 mm below the cortical surface (in layer II/III). FPs were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA, USA), A/D converted at 10 kHz, and stored using the Micro1401 interface and Signal 4 software (CED, Cambridge, UK). The stimulus–response curves obtained for each slice were fit with the Boltzmann equation: Vi = Vmax/(1 + exp((u .... with Vmax being the maximum FP amplitude; u—stimulation  intensity;  uh—stimulation  intensity  evoking  the  FP  of  half-maximum amplitude; S—factor proportional to the slope of the curve.  The threshold stimulation was determined as the stimulus intensity necessary to evoke the FP of approximately 0.1 mV in amplitude. The results are expressed as the meansSEM. The student’st-test, a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, or a post-hoc Tamhane’s T2 multiple comparisons test following a Welch’s ANOVA test were used to evaluate differences between groups.  For the measurement of the short-term plasticity, the paired-pulse stimulation protocol was used (duration—0.2 ms, inter-stimulus interval ISI—50ms). Stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke a response of 30% of the maximum FP amplitude. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the second FP to the amplitude of the first FP. For the induction of LTP, theta burst stimulation (TBS) was used.  The stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke a response of 30% of the maximum FP amplitude.  TBS consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz, each composed of five pulses at 100 Hz, repeated five  times  every  15  s.   During  TBS  the  pulse  duration  was  increased  to  0.3  ms.   LTP magnitude was determined as an average increase in the amplitude of the FPs recorded between 45 and 60 min after TBS, relative to the baseline.

<!-- To reach the saturation level of LTP, TBS sequences were repeated 4 and 5 times at the cortical input to the BLA, respectively, every 45 minutes [17]. --> 
<!-- The strength of synaptic communication was determined by measuring the initial slope of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSP) in an interface chamber. -->
<!--Electrical stimulation of 100–300 mA for 100 msec was applied using a bipolar tungsten (10-mm diameter) isonel-coated wire (A-M Systems analog stimulus isolator).-->
<!--Additional details of recording field potentials have been previously described (Pita-Almenar et al. 2006). [@pita-almentar_2012] -->

<!-- Watanabe et al. (1995) have carried out intracellular recordings of evoked potentials and confirmed that the latency of peak negative field potentials corresponds well with that of intracellularly recorded action potentials, indicating that the extracellularly recorded sharp negativity seems to be a population spike. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the amplitude of field potentials. 
Additionally, the slope measure in the lateral amygdala is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal, making it more difficult to analyze (Doyere et al., 2003). 
Thus, we also decided to record PS in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, to get a better comparison of results between these two limbic structures. 
Single or paired stimuli (duration 100 μ s) were presented every 10 s. -->
 
Synaptic strength was quantified as the peak amplitude of EPSP or EPSC. 
Baseline responses were collected with a stimulation intensity that yielded 10–30% of the maximal response.
Slices displaying unstable baseline recording were discarded. 

 
 Field potentials were amplified with a differential amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.). Output was digitized with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). On- and off-line data acquisition and analysis were carried out using WCP version 1.7b (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes were normalized to averaged baseline value (100%). The maximum rate of fEPSP within 10–90% declining phase was measuredas the slope of fEPSP using the WCP software. The recordings were made at room temperature. That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. Stimulation Synaptic responses were evokedwith sharpened tungsten bipolarstimulating electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,FL) placed in the external capsule (EC). The stimulating electrode was ~2 mm from the recording site. Stimuli were delivered using a photoelectric stimulus isolation unit with a constant cur-rent output (ISO-Flex; Stimulus Isolation Unit, Jerusalem, Israel). The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a synaptic response of less than 50% of the maximum amplitude. Single 0.1-msec monophasic square pulses were applied continuously throughout the experiment at 0.1 Hz. To induce synaptic plasticity, theta burst stimulation (TBS), trains of five pulses at 100 Hz were given at 5 Hz (the theta rhythm) for 4 s, at the same intensity through the same electrode used for test stimulation. TBS mimics the typical firing mode of hippocampal pyramidal cells during learning (Otto et al.1991). @chen_2017
 
 Glass microelectrodes(Science Products) werefilled with ACSF (tip resistance 3 MΩ) and placed in the LA to recordfield potentials. Bipolar stimulationelectrodes were used to stimulatefibers within the LA (IN) or in theexternal capsule (EC). An input/output response curve was constructed by varying the intensity of the single-pulse stimulation and averaging six responses per intensity. The stimulus intensity that evoked afield potential with amplitude equal to 50% of themaximal response was then used for all subsequent stimulations. Once a stable baseline of responses had been obtained for at least 20 min, either HFS (two trains at 100 Hz, 1 sec duration, 30 sec apart) was delivered as to induce LTP or low frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz, 15 min) was applied to induce LTD (Müller et al. 2009). Subsequent responses to single stimuli were recorded for at least 60 min, and their amplitude quantified as a percent change with re-spect to baseline. The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP. Drug applicationAll drugs were bath-applied at the indicated concentrations starting at least 30 min before HFS or LFS. Capsaicin and AMG 9810 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience. Data analysis Extracellular data were collected and averaged using the custommade software Signal 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). We defined thefield potential amplitude as the absolute DC voltage of a verti-cal line running from the minimal point of thefield potential to itsintersection with a line running tangential to thefield potentialonset and offset points. The significance of differences betweengroups (n= number of slices) was calculated with a two-wayANOVA (GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad software). Significance was set atP< 0.05. To express and compare changes in the ampli-tudes of thefield potentials between the animal groups, we aver-aged responses from the period of 59 to 60 min after HFS or LFS.
 
 They were then submerged in a chamber (1.0 ml, 2.5 ml/min) at 30  1°C for another hour before recording. BLA fibers were stimulated with concentric electrodes (50 k  ) using 150-s pulses of varying intensity (3–15 V) at 0.05 Hz, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the capsula/medial CeA with tungsten electrodes (2–5 M  ). fEPSP magnitude was adjusted to 30% of maximum response and baseline recorded, and LTP was induced using high-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of five trains of stimuli (100 Hz for 1 s, 3-min intervals). fEPSPs were recorded at 0.05 Hz for another hour, and their slopes were normalized to baseline values. A one- or twotailed unpaired t -test or one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests were used for statistical analysis; n equals the number of slices. Methodologies for patch recording (Liu et al. 2004) and Western blot analysis (Zinebi et al. 2003) were similar to that reported previousl
 
 
 One slice per animal was investigated. Recordings began approx. 2.5 h after slice preparation and LTP/LTD induction was attempted approx. 1 h later. Field potentials (FPs) were evoked using the concentric platinum/stainless steel electrode (FHC, USA) by the stimulation (frequency: 0.05 Hz, duration: 100 u s) of external or internal capsule to stimulate cortico-amygdalar or thalamo-amygdalar connections, respectively (reviewed in [24] ). FPs were recorded using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–3 M ́) placed in the LA. Signals were amplified (Axoprobe 2, Axon Instruments, USA), band-pass fil-tered (1 Hz–5 kHz), A/D converted (micro1401 interface, CED, UK) and analyzed on- and off-line (Signal 2 software, CED, UK). Since the initial slope measure of the FP in the LA is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal [23] , we analyzed the amplitude of FPs. After initial stabilization of the responses, input–output curves were constructed and then the stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke FPs of 50% of the maximum amplitude. After 15 min of baseline recording, LTP was induced by the theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol consisting of three trains of stimuli delivered every 5 min. Each train was composed of six sequences of pulses delivered at frequency of 5 Hz [29] . Each sequence consisted of eight pulses delivered at 100 Hz. TBS stimulation pattern was used since LA projection neurons have an intrinsic propensity to generate voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations in the theta frequency range [15] and stimulation of the LA at theta frequency induces local activity that resembles that occurring during fear [30] . In a separate set of experiments, after 15 min of baseline recording, LTD was induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses at 1 Hz) [26] . Both TBS and LFS were repeated every 45 min in order to reach the saturation level of LTP and LTD, respectively [28] . LTP/LTD was considered saturated if the difference between the amplitudes of FPs after consecutive TBS/LFS delivery was not significant. To examine short-term plasticity, paired-pulse stimulation protocols were used. The stimulation intensity was set so that the first stimulus of a pair evoked a response that was 50% of the maximum. Paired stimuli were delivered every 20 s to both inputs to the LA in an interleaved fashion. Inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 25, 50, 100, 200, 600 and 1000 ms were tested in an ascending order and at each interval four successive FPs were recorded. @danielewicz_2014
 


 
#### DATA ANALYSIS
 
Statistical analyses were performed using the SigmaPlot 11.0 software (Systat Software, Inc.). 
The mean amplitude of responses recorded after the last conditioning stimulation was compared to the initial baseline values and expressed as a percentage of change. 
Group comparisons employed two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the type of treatment (MS or control) as the first factor and the drug administered (imipramine or saline) as the second factor. 
Two-way ANOVA was followed by the Tukey’s posthoc test and p < 0.05 was taken as significant. 
Data are presented as group means ± SEM. 
Stimulus-response plots were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: Vi= Vmax/(1 + exp ((u-uh)/-S)). The following parameters were compared: the maximum field potential amplitude (Vmax), the stimulation intensity evoking a field potential of half-maximum amplitude (uh) and the factor proportional to the slope of the curve (S). @danielewicz_2017

<!-- when writing about validation??? CHEMOKINE INTERACTIONS WITH THE SEROTONIN AND OPIOID SYSTEMS: ANATOMICAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE RAT BRAIN
A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002)./// To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002). /// The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007). A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - - PHD thesis ///
The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).-->

Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with omission of primary antibodies and no specific staining was detected (data not shown). <!-- Appendix? -->


### Cell counting

All image analysis, cell counts and fluorescence measurements were performed “off-line” on captured images taken from stained sections.
The total numbers of positively identified cells expressing either chosen marker of chemokine/CKR of interest were counted manually in individual brain sections. <!-- from 3 rats in each treatment group. -->

The total number of cells, Iba1+ microglia, <!--Parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons and DCX+ neuroblasts--> were calculated under a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with the Apotome.2 optical sectioning module (Carl Zeiss) 63x/1.4 oil immersion plan apochromatic objective for all the cell counts. <!--(63x Oil immersion objective for all the cell counts except for PV+ interneurons, which were analyzed under a 25X Oil immersion objective) //  Information about individual neuron morphology and immunohistochemistry was acquired using optical z-stacks taken with the 20x/0.8 air objective and the 63x/1.4 oilimmersion plan apochromatic objective respectively on a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with the Apotome.2 op  -  tical sectioning module (Carl Zeiss). --> 
<!--Briefly, six stacks of images per animal were used to determine the density of mature granule neurons in a reference structure of known volume (30 (X) ? 30 (Y) ? 10 (Z) lm). The average density of these cells was then multiplied by either the total volume of the DG (in the case of the number of mature granule neurons) or by the length of the subgranular zone (SGZ) (in the case of the number of DCX+ neuroblasts) in order to calculate the total number of cells per animal (Llorens-Martin et al., 2006). Bolos2018-->
The number of cells was counted  separately in the central and basolateral amygdala. 
<!--PV+ interneurons were counted in the DG. 
To this end, the area including the GL, ML and the H was contoured on confocal stacks of images, and the number of PV+ cells surrounded by PNNs within that contour were counted in each stack of images. The number of cells was then divided by the drawn area, and cell density (cells/mm3) was represented in the graphs. Bolos2018 -->
In order to address <!-- microglial activation-->, we measured <!--CD68--> expression by immunohistochemistry in cells located in the central and basolateral amygdala. 
Briefly, <!--confocal--> stacks of 20 images were obtained under a <!--LSM710 Zeiss confocal microscope (63x Oil immersion objective, Z-axis interval: 0.4 mm, XY dimensions: 79.38 mm).-->
Three-channel images were acquired <!--(DAPI, CD68 and Iba1)-->. 
For each image, a fixed value threshold was applied to the Iba1 channel, and then the threshold image was converted in a Selection.
A Mean filter (2 pixels) was applied in order to delete precipitates of the secondary antibody. 
The selection was then loaded in the CD68 channel. 
Selections were inverted in both channels, and the exterior of the cells was filled with black paint. 
Resulting images were then processed with the Just Another Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) in ImageJ, as previously described (Llorens-Martin et al., 2016). 
The percentage of colocalization between the two channels (Iba1+ area that was also CD68+ (Mander’s coefficient M1)) is represented in the graphs.

The percentage of MCH neurons that express CXCR4 in a given field was calculated as the ratio of the number of double labelled CXCR4 ⁄ MCH over that of MCH-positive cells

<!-- Assessment was performed by independent blinded investigators who quantified the total number of activated microglia. 
The numbers of activated microglia in each treatment group were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted. -->

<!-- In the other cases, quantification has been validated by two independent people. -->
<!-- Brightfield images have been acquired using a Widefield Observer (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer) slide scanner. -->
Fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8). 
Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji<!--citation?--> imaging software. <!-- Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji32 and QuPath33 imaging software. -->
For cell quantification of fluorescent images and brightfield images in which no automated quantification was possible, a minimum of eight randomly chosen regions of equal dimensions per rat and region were acquired.
Total cell numbers per mm2 were calculated based on the image dimensions. 
For fluorescent images, z-stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells was quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. 
<!-- For quantification of the single-channel brightfield images and the BaseScope IHC double-positive images, the number of cells was also quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. -->
<!-- The average of these different regions was taken and considered as n = 1. 
Where possible, brightfield images were quantified automatically. 
Therefore, whole slides were scanned using a slide scanner. 
Using QuPath, a minimum of four random regions per sample and condition were annotated, and cells within these regions were quantified using the automated ‘positive cell detection’ plugin.-->
<!--For the quantification of the duplex BaseScope, random brightfield images were acquired in the white matter of control donors. -->
All cells with a positive BaseScope signal were quantified and represent 100% of labelled cells; the percentages of single- or double-positive cells were determined.

## Morphometric analysis of the dendritic spines of neuronal primary cell cultures


## Statistical analysis

All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 [@R_base], with mainly the dplyr (v0.8.3; @dplyr), and the ggplot2 (v3.2.1; @ggplot2) packages. <!-- poprawić --> 
Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. 
Group data for inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as median`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")`SD. <!-- Data are reported as median `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` SEM. -->
Following verification of a normal distribution, Student’s unpaired t-test was used to compare parametric data from two groups. “n” represents the number of neurons or microglial processes used in each group, and is followed by “N” representing the number of mice per group. 
The details of the statistical analyses are provided in Results. 
All relevant data are available from the authors

For immunohistochemical experiments, results are expressed as percentage of CXCR7/Olig2- positive cells compared to the total number of CXCR7-EGFP cells in the SVZ (n=6). <!-- zmienić jeszcze trochę --> 

For patch clamp experiments, chemokines impact on sIPSC characteristics<!-- bardziej ogólnie-->, were analyzed by comparing pre- and post-application values using a paired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for non-normally distributed data.

For electrocellular recordings, .... 

Extracellular data were collected and averaged using the custommade software Signal 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). 
We defined the amplitude as the absolute DC voltage of a vertical line running from the minimal point of the field potential to its intersection with a line running tangentially to the field potential onset and offset points. 
The significance of differences between groups ( n = number of slices) was calculated via two-way ANOVA(GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad software, San Diego, California). 
Significance was set at p < .05. 
To express and compare changes in the amplitudes of the field potentials between the animal groups, we averaged responses from the period of 59 to 60 min and 179 to 180 min, respectively, after HFS/TBS. 
We averaged responses to LFS from the period of 19 to 20 min. 
Analysis of PPF was additionally performed by means of Mann – Whitney test.

We employed the rabbit anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs) to avoid species cross-reactivity during the combined application of SDF-1α and CXCR4 antibodies.

We characterized mouse visual cortex neurons with a uniform experimental protocol and developed an unsupervised classification scheme of cell types based on electrophysiology and morphology.
Every aspect of the pipeline, from slice preparation, recording, and stimulation, to staining, imaging, reconstruction, and mapping of cells to a reference atlas, employed highly standardized and quality-controlled methodology. 

Extracellular recordings from the LA and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. /// analogous

Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. 

Although such experiments were not performed until now in the CA1 region the TBS protocol seems to be suited to apply in this experiment on the basis of the laminated structure of the CA1 region. 

Therefore, we decided to apply HFS in the LA and TBS in the CA1 region after induction of LTD to maximize the potentiation levels and enhance the chance to detect differences between the groups.
