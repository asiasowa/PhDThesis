## General {#general}

### Ethic approval

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15 January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal Research (Krakow, Poland). 
All efforts were made to minimize suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

### Animals

Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Research Models and Services; Germany).<!-- Po dostawie zwierzęta przechodziły kilkudniową adaptację do warunków pomieszczenia hodowlanego -->
Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm) lined with wooden bedding in a controlled environment (22 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, 45 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 5 % relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) with commercial food and fresh water *ad libitum*. 
Animals were acclimated to the housing environment for at least four days before the beginning of the experiments. 
For patch-clamp experiments, rats weighing 180-300g (5-10 weeks of age) were used.
For immunostaining experiments, rats weighing 300-350 g were used.
<!-- zwierzęta na hodowle? -->
Animals at this age are considered young adults. 
The age of the animals for each experiment was determined to assure credible and interpretable results.


### Reagents {#drugs}

In electrophysiological experiments, all reagents used for preparing ACSF and internal solution were purchased from Roth (Carl Roth GmbH, Germany)  and bath-applied by a peristaltic pump, unless stated otherwise.<!--All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).  czy na pewno? --><!-- Details regarding the primary and secondary antibodies used in our immunohistochem istry experiments are provided in Table 2 - 1. --><!-- All reagents for phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), artificial cerebrospinal fluid and intrapipette solution (ACSF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), apart from single biocytin batches purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK, Cat No. 3349). Pertussis toxin was purchased from Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, Cat No. PHZ1174). -->
<!-- The time necessary for the solution to flow from the stopcocks to the slice was approximately 15 s. -->


Other electrophysiological reagents suppliers and used doses were as follows: 
500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker from Tocris Bioscience, UK), 
100 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M picrotoxin (a GABA~A~ receptor antagonist from Tocris Bioscience, UK),  
10 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M CGP52432  (a GABA~B~ receptor antagonist from Tocris Bioscience, UK).


Chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were purchased from R&D Systems.
All peptides were dissolved in sterile PBS, aliquoted, and stored at -20`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, unless stated otherwise.
Concentrations for both chemokines were 2 and 5nM.

For blocking CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors, highly selective antagonists (AZD8797 and AMD3100) were used, respectively.
AZD8797 was obtained from Axon Medchem, The Netherlands, and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at the concentration of AZD8797 was 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M.
AMD3100 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and its final concentration was 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M. 

For microglia and astrocytes inhibition, the minocycline and fluorocitric acid were used, respectively.
Both reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
Minocycline was freshly dissolved in ACSF at the final concentration (20`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M) before recordings.
Fluorocitric acid was used at concentration 100`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M. 

The determination of the doses for CX3CL1, CXCL12, AZD8797, AMD3100, minocycline, and fluorocitric acid was based on previous studies [@baxter_2021; @heinisch_2009; @heinisch_2010; @scianni_2013; @sheridan_2014; @yang_2016].

All drugs were dissolved in deionized water, aliquoted, and stored at -20`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, unless stated otherwise.
The drugs were diluted to the final concentration in the recording ACSF just before use.

## Electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices {#electromethod}

### Tissue preparation for electrophysiological experiments {#decap}

Male Wistar (4-7-week-old) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m. 
Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal–fluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO~3~, 1.4 NaH~2~PO~4~, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl~2~, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O~2~/5% CO~2~), pH 7.4; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and cut into 300 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for patch-clamp experiments and  400 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for extracellular recordings on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). 
After slicing, brain slices containing the amygdala were transferred and held in an incubation chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~, and 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^). 
Slices were incubated at 31–33`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT).
After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of a Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min) with carbogenated, warm (32`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^).


### Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition {#patchclampmethod}
<!-- zrobić zdjęcia z DIC i miejscem -->
Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC). 
The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD camera and displayed on a computer monitor. 
The border of the basolateral and central amygdala was identified based on visual control by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos Atlas [@paxinos_2007], corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal to bregma (see Figure: \@ref(fig:methodpatch)). <!-- lepszy figure --> 
Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. 
Cells were approached under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland). 
Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (3–6 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`; Sutter Instruments, USA) using a horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments P–97) and filled with the following solutions.

<!--  (A) Drawing of a mouse brain sagittal section showing the location of stimulating and recording electrodes for corticostriatal fPSC recordings (adapted from Paxinos Mouse Brain Atlas).-->
For experiment measuring excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability, the intrapipette solution contained (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl~2~, 2 MgCl~2~, 5 Na~2~ATP, 0.4 Na~3~GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, osmolarity 290-300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and biocytin (0.1%, for subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). 
For experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na~2~, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 280-290 mOsmol kg^−1^.

The pipette was positively pressurized by applying a mouth suction to help prevent contamination of the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity of the membrane, keeping a positive pressure. 
After forming a high-resistance seal (> 1 G`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`, cell-attached configuration) between the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure, the second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of membrane enclosed with the pipette's tip and access inside of the neuron. 
Electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode was established (whole-cell configuration). 
After break-in, cells stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly diffuses from the pipette into the cytoplasm.
Ground electrode, which was chloride-coated silver wire in a chamber filled with bath solution, kept the electrical potential of the outer side of the cell membrane at 0 mV. 
The electrical potential of the inner side of the cell membrane was controlled through a patch electrode filled with the intrapipette solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4 Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA). 
Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20kHz, and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, USA). 
Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA). 
All membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential (estimated as `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`12 mV). 
The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. 
Only recordings with stable access resistance lower than 30 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")` were considered acceptable for analysis. 
All drugs were delivered *via* a bath perfusion system. <!-- antibodies? -->
<!--  Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.// The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.-->

#### Recording protocols, data analysis, and statistics {#electroprotocols}

Whole-cell patch-clamp is capable of detecting transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration or measuring membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration. 
Hence, to measure the effects of chemokines (CX3CL1/CXCL12) on intrinsic membrane properties, the experiments were recorded in the whole-cell patch-clamp under the current-clamp configuration. 
The measured features are illustrated in Fig. \@ref(fig:methodIV).
First, 5 minutes after breaking into the cell, (1) the resting membrane potential (RMP) was recorded. 
Then, several membrane parameters were assessed based on neuronal voltage responses from -65 mV holding potential to hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms, 10 or 5pA increments), and analyzed using custom scripts.<!-- In order to characterize the behavior of recorded neurons, 22 electrophysiological parameters were measured-->
(2) Input resistance (R~m~), (3) membrane time constant (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03C4")`~m~), and (4) membrane capacitance (C~m~) were determined in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses eliciting voltage shifts whose amplitude was 10–20 mV negative to rest.<!-- (Kawaguchi 1993) // inne cytowanie--> 
R~m~ was measured following Ohm's law (R~m~ = $\frac{dV~m~}{I}$)<!--(R~m~ = dV~m~/ I)-->, where dV~m~ is the change in membrane potential in response to - 20 pA (500 ms) current injection (I).
`r knitr::asis_output("\U03C4")`~m~ was determined at the beginning of the voltage response and computed by fitting it to a single exponential.
C~m~ calculated according to the equation C~m~= $\frac{\tau~m~}{R~m~}$).

Cell excitability was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a linear regression model (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodIV), parts a and b).
(5) The gain (slope) and (6) threshold current/rheobase (minimal current necessary to fire the first action potential were determined for further analysis.
(7) Action potential threshold corresponded to the voltage threshold of the first action potential elicited by a current step, defined as the voltage at which the time derivative of V~m~($\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}$) is 20 V s^−1^.
(8) The spike latency (often referred to as onset or delay), measured from the start of square depolarizing current pulse injection to the peak of the first action potential evoked by the rheobase.
(9) The amplitudes of the first action potential (AP; measured from the threshold to the positive peak of the rheobase).
(10) AP width (measured at half-amplitude).
(11) Maximal firing rate (F~max~, defined as the trace with the largest number of action potentials).
(12) First interspike interval (ISI~first~, in ms). The time interval between the threshold of the first action potential and the threshold of the second action potential in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current injection at <!-- ? jaki threshold ?? -->
(13) Last interspike interval (ISI~last~, in ms)- the time interval between the threshold of the penultimate action potential and the threshold of the last action potential in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current injection. 
(14) Spike adaptation ratio - the ratio of ISI~first~ to ISI~last~.

In some cases, especially in the CeL neurons, the sag, post-inhibitory rebound spikes, or spontaneous firing were present.
However, these features were scarce and were not considered in further analysis due to the possibility of inconsistent results.

In another set of experiments, the aim was to investigate the influence of either CX3CR1 or CXCR4 receptors activation on spontaneous/miniature inhibitory/excitatory synaptic currents, performed in normal ACSF and ACSF containing TTX (500 nM), respectively  in the voltage-clamp configuration (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)). 
The details of additional experimental conditions are provided in Results (\@ref(results)). <!-- wytlumaczyć skróty podobnie jak chemokiny (sEPSC/mEPSC/sIPSC/mIPSC)-->
<!-- The calculated reversal potential for Cl- currents in these patch-clamp recordings equalled -90.51 mV, pominąć raczej -->
At holding potential of -70mV, inward events represented excitatory postsynaptic currents (Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)a), whereas to record inhibitory postsynaptic currents, neurons were voltage-clamped at 0 mV (Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)b).
After 10 min of the stabilization period, the baseline postsynaptic current activity was recorded. 
The action of chosen chemokine was assessed by adding a known concentration of a stock solution directly to the bath and taking the measures before (baseline) and during 15 min of chemokine superfusion.
For analysis, the 4-minute-long recordings from baseline and after 15 minutes of chemokine application were selected.<!--The nature of postsynaptic currents was verified using glutamate (10 μM CNQX, 50 μM DL-AP5 and GABA (20 μM bicuculline) receptor antagonists (Fig. M2 B, C)  chyba mam tylko bicuculine... może jakaś zamykająca się komórka...? albo któryś z fluorocitrate? albo jakaś tomkowa, ktora nic nie ma? -->
From detected events, their median frequency, amplitude, rise time, and decay time were measured (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)).
These parameters were statistically tested (baseline versus chemokine application). 
Group data for excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as median`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")`SD. 

At first, postsynaptic currents were detected using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., USA) or TaroTools toolbox for Igor Pro (https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister, v8.0.4, USA).
However, these software required subjective selection of the threshold amplitude of events and visual inspection of the researcher to prevent the inclusion of false data.
It leads to a semi-automatic approach, which might be prone to error and researcher bias.
Thus, a machine learning-based approach was used.
To this end, Eventer [@winchester_giles_2020] software allowed training a model to implement consistent selection criteria across data sets without bias.
The same traces were analyzed using all of these software and selection based on models trained in Eventer was the most rigorous, thereby the occurrence of false positive events is less likely.
Importantly, the differences between the control and experimental conditions remained unchanged (data not shown). 
Hence, the synaptic transmission data presented in this dissertation was done using a machine-learning approach in Eventer software.

All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 [@R_base], with mainly the dplyr (v0.8.3; @dplyr), and the ggplot2 (v3.2.1; @ggplot2) packages. 
To compare membrane properties and synaptic transmission between different groups, they were analyzed using paired t-test.
For non-normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used. <!-- Statistical comparisons were conducted using Repeat-measure, two-way and one-way ANOVA followed Tukey's HSD test using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05.-->

#### Electrophysiological identification and classification of neurons in the BLA and CeA

Once the whole-cell recording was obtained, the cell's characteristics were recorded using current-clamp techniques.
Neurons were identified by location, the shape of a cell body, and morphology, but mainly by specific firing properties (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodpatch)).

##### Electrophysiological identification of principal cells in the BLA

Principal neurons were identified based on their unique set of features (see chapter Amygdala \@ref(BLA)).

The classification was made using criteria derived from other morphological and electrophysiological studies [@faber_2002; @jasnow_2009; @par_1995; @popescu_2011; @sosulina_2006; @washburn_1992a].<!-- perumal_2021 -->
In addition to their pyramidal-like soma shape, these cells were distinguished from a heterogeneous group of interneurons based on such firing properties:
(a) their prominent spike adaptation ratio,
(b) low excitability (around 6-20 Hz),
(c) absence of spontaneous firing,
(d) low input resistance (50-100 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U03A9")`), and
(e) comparatively long duration of action potential (< 0.8 ms at half-amplitude).
Considering the heterogeneity of principal cells, especially with regard to adaptation ratio, the more reliable criteria were the action potential duration, the first inter-spike interval, and low input.
Thus, neurons whose action potential was wider than 0.8 ms, first ISI exceeded 20ms and showing input resistance larger than 150 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U03A9")` were excluded from further analysis. 

Given that principal cells constitute around 90% of the whole neuronal population in the BLA, by chance alone, a sample of BLA neurons should mainly comprise this class of neurons. 
Hence, by applying these strict criteria, the probability of including interneurons in the further analysis<!--misclassification interneurons as principal cells--> was much lowered.

##### Electrophysiological identification of neurons in the CeA

Neurons in the CeL display heterogeneous intrinsic excitability (@amano_2012; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @hunt_2017; @lopezdearmentia_2004; @martina_1999; @sah_2003a; see chapter Amygdala \@ref(CeA)).<!--Chieng et al., 2006 ; Chiang et al., 2015,-->
Based on their response to somatic current injections, the majority  of them (~96%) exhibit either the Regular-Spiking or the Late-Firing phenotype in response to depolarizing current steps.
The remaining 4% comprise other types of CeL neurons (often designated as fast-spiking and low-firing); however, they were encountered too infrequently (3.5 and 1.5%, respectively) to allow reliable quantitative analyses.
Thus, they were excluded from further analysis.

The Late-Firing neurons show a significant delay before the onset of the first action potential (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`100–200 ms).
During  this  delay,  the  membrane potential depolarized slowly in such a way there is a depolarizing ramp (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsBLACeAIVrep)b, upper trace).
Little or no spike-frequency adaptation was seen in these neurons.
The Regular-Spiking neurons, also described as Early-Spiking, exhibit shorter AP onset, `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`50 ms, and a more prominent adaptation ratio.

However, similar to what was observed by @hunt_2017, the AP onset highly varied in recorded cells regardless of their type.
Given that the classification based on the presence of spike frequency accommodation was reported to be reliable [@hou_2016; @hunt_2017], the classification was based on both the AP onset and the presence of spike frequency adaptation.<!--okropne zdanie...-->
In addition, regarding experiments measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the cesium-based internal solution was used, which significantly altered the action potential properties of neurons shortly after the beginning of the recordings [@golding_1999].
The identification of CeL neurons included in the present study was therefore achieved immediately after rupture of the Gigaseal by evaluating the firing response to the injecting of depolarizing current.
Additional verification was also the observation that even during long-lasting recordings, Late-Firing neurons exhibited the presence of the depolarizing ramp at subthreshold current step.

<!-- According to this criterion following neurons were included in the study on chemokines signaling in the amygdala (only one neuron per slice was subjected to drug administration experiment): /// nie wiem czy to dodawać bo musiałabym obliczyć ;P patrz: ALAN dla reszty gdybym się jednak zdecydowała-->


### Extracellular recordings, data acquisition, and statistics

As the BLA is widely known to be involved in emotional learning and memory, and mounting evidence points to CX3CL1 as a crucial player in these phenomena, additional experiments investigating the role of CX3CL1 in the BLA LTP was performed.
Slices containing the BLA were transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a recording ACSF (33.5 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 0.5`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C), the same as for patch-clamp recordings. 
Recordings began approx. 1.5 h after slice preparation.

For field potentials (FPs) recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode and a recording electrode  were visually positioned under a dissecting microscope in the external capsule and the basolateral region of the amygdala, respectively,  as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:methodpatch) 
A Pt-Ir electrode (CBARC85, FHC, USA) was used for stimulation, whereas recordings were made using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–2 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U03A9")`), pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a List-Medical L/M 3P-A micropipette puller.
The recording electrode was placed in the slice in the area corresponding with the BLA.
Stimuli (duration: 0.2 ms) were applied at 0.016 Hz using a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (WPI).
Signals<!--FPs--> were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, USA), filtered (1-500 Hz), A/D converted at 10 kHz and stored using the Micro1401 interface and SIGAVG 4 software (CED, UK).
A stimulus–response (input–output) curve was obtained for each slice.
For that purpose, stimulation intensity was progressively elevated step-wise (21 steps; 0–100 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`A, with 5 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`A increments). 
In all experiments, baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of sufficient intensity<!--(300 e 800mA)--> to elicit a response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field potentials, which was fixed at this level throughout all experiments.
Stimulus-response curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: V~i~= V~max~ /(1 + exp((u-uh)/-S)), where V~max~ is the maximum FP amplitude; u—stimulation  intensity;  uh—stimulation  intensity  evoking  the  FP  of  half-maximum amplitude; S—factor proportional to the slope of the curve.

To measure the short-term plasticity, the paired-pulse stimulation protocol was used (duration—0.2 ms, inter-stimulus interval ISI—50ms).
The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the second FP to the amplitude of the first FP.

After 15 minutes of baseline recording, the LTP was induced using theta burst stimulation (TBS).
It consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz, repeated five times every 15 s. 
Each train consisted of five pulses at 100 Hz. 
During TBS, pulse duration was extended to 0.3 ms. 
Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded at 0.016 Hz for another hour.
The amount of LTP was determined as an average increase in the amplitude of FPs recorded between 45 and 60 min after TBS, relative to baseline.
The health of the slice was monitored by continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout experiments. 
Slices displaying unstable baseline recording were discarded. 
Data are presented as group means `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` SEM.
Statistical significance was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test or ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons.
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).


## Immunohistochemistry

### Tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry

Rats (n = 6) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described in the study by @makowiak_2011.
After a post-fixation period of 12 h, 50`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m-thick sections of the brain were cut in the coronal plane using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000). 

### Immunofluorescence staining
<!-- zmienić/// dokończyć -->
To analyze co-localization of CX3CR1 with neurons<!--inaczej to ująć bo nie tylko neurons--> in the BLA or CeA, slices containing amygdala were initially washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and then blocked for 1 h (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS).
CX3CR1 localization to neurons was determined by a sequential incubation of brain slices with a rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs, USA) with either mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:200; Millipore, USA), mouse anti-CAMKII`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (1:1000; Invitrogen, USA), mouse anti-PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")` (1:700; BD Biosciences, USA), or mouse anti-SOM (1:700; GeneTex, USA).
Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse antibodies. 
Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) and an Alexa 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. 

Next, brain sections were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and CX3CL1, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCL12 and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.<!-- zmienić ...// Slices were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rabbit; 1:500 dilution; Invitrogen A-11011). -->

A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002)./// To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002). /// The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007). A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - - PHD thesis ///
The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).-->

Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with omission of primary antibodies and no specific staining was detected (data not shown). <!-- Appendix? -->

### Image analysis 

In order to address the co-localization between cell type markers and chemokines/CKRs of interest,  fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with the Apotome.2 optical sectioning module (Carl Zeiss) 63x/1.4 oil immersion plan apochromatic objective.<!-- dodać, że niektóre 20x? // Briefly,  stacks of 20 images were obtained under a LSM710 Zeiss confocal microscope (63x Oil immersion objective, Z-axis interval: 0.4 mm, XY dimensions: 79.38 mm).-->
Three-channel images were acquired DAPI, CX3CR1 and NeuN/SOM/PKCdelta/CAMKIIalpha. 
<!--For each image, a fixed value threshold was applied to the Iba1 channel, and then the threshold image was converted in a Selection.
A Mean filter (2 pixels) was applied in order to delete precipitates of the secondary antibody. 
The selection was then loaded in the CD68 channel. 
Selections were inverted in both channels, and the exterior of the cells was filled with black paint.  -->

All image analysis, cell counts, and fluorescence measurements were performed “off-line” on captured images taken from stained sections using open-source Fiji<!--citation?--> imaging software.<!-- Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji32 and QuPath33 imaging software. -->
<!-- For fluorescent images, z-stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells was quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. -->
The total numbers of positively identified cells expressing either chosen marker of chemokine/CKR of interest were counted manually in individual brain sections.<!-- from 3 rats in each treatment group. -->
The number of cells was counted  separately in the central and basolateral amygdala.
All DAPI-labeled cells expressing markers (CAMKII, SOM, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`) were counted in the BLA or CeA and subsequently classified as "total CAMK+/SOM/PKC/-labeled" cells. 
The percentage of marker-labeled neurons that express CX3CR1 in a given nucleus was calculated as the percentage of the number of double labeled cells over that of specific marker-positive cells.

We employed the rabbit anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs) to avoid species cross-reactivity during the combined application of SDF-1α and CXCR4 antibodies.

We characterized mouse visual cortex neurons with a uniform experimental protocol and developed an unsupervised classification scheme of cell types based on electrophysiology and morphology.
Every aspect of the pipeline, from slice preparation, recording, and stimulation, to staining, imaging, reconstruction, and mapping of cells to a reference atlas, employed highly standardized and quality-controlled methodology. 

Extracellular recordings from the LA and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. /// analogous

Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. 

Although such experiments were not performed until now in the CA1 region the TBS protocol seems to be suited to apply in this experiment on the basis of the laminated structure of the CA1 region. 

Therefore, we decided to apply HFS in the LA and TBS in the CA1 region after induction of LTD to maximize the potentiation levels and enhance the chance to detect differences between the groups. 

That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. 

The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP.
