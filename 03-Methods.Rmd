### Ethic approval

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15 January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal Research (Krakow, Poland). 
All efforts were made to minimize suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

### Animals

Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Research Models and Services; Germany).<!-- Po dostawie zwierzęta przechodziły kilkudniową adaptację do warunków pomieszczenia hodowlanego -->
Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm) lined with wooden bedding in a controlled environment (22 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, 45 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 5 % relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) with commercial food and fresh water *ad libitum*. 
Animals were acclimated to the housing environment for at least four days before the beginning of the experiments. 
For patch-clamp experiments, rats weighing 180-300g (5-10 weeks of age) were used.
For immunostaining experiments, rats weighing 300-350 g were used.
<!-- zwierzęta na hodowle? -->
Animals at this age are considered young adults. 
The age of the animals for each experiment was determined to assure credible and interpretable results.

## Electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices {#electromethod}

### Tissue preparation for electrophysiological experiments {#decap}

Male Wistar (4-7-week-old) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m. 
Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal–fluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO~3~, 1.4 NaH~2~PO~4~, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl~2~, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O~2~/5% CO~2~), pH 7.4; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and cut into 300 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for patch-clamp experiments and  400 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick coronal sections for extracellular recordings on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). 
After slicing, brain slices containing the amygdala were transferred and held in an incubation chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~, and 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^). 
Slices were incubated at 31–33`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT).
After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of a Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min) with carbogenated, warm (32`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^).


### Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition {#patchclampmethod}
<!-- zrobić zdjęcia z DIC i miejscem -->
Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC). 
The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD camera and displayed on a computer monitor. 
The border of the basolateral and central amygdala were identified based on visual control by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos Atlas [@paxinos_2007], corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal to bregma (see Figure: \@ref(fig:methodpatch)). <!-- lepszy figure --> 
Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. 
Cells were approached under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland). 
Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (3–6 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`; Sutter Instruments, USA) using a horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments P–97) and filled with the following solutions.

<!--  (A) Drawing of a mouse brain sagittal section showing the location of stimulating and recording electrodes for corticostriatal fPSC recordings (adapted from Paxinos Mouse Brain Atlas).-->
For experiment measuring excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability, the intrapippete solution contained (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl~2~, 2 MgCl~2~, 5 Na~2~ATP, 0.4 Na~3~GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, osmolarity 290-300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and biocytin (0.1%, for subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). 
For experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na~2~, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 280-290 mOsmol kg^−1^.

The pipette was positively pressurized by applying a mouth suction to help prevent contamination of the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity of the membrane, keeping a positive pressure. 
After forming a high-resistance seal (> 1 G`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")`, cell-attached configuration) between the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure, the second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of membrane enclosed with the pipette's tip and access inside of the neuron. 
Electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode was established (whole-cell configuration). 
After break-in, cells stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly diffuses from the pipette into the cytoplasm.
Ground electrode, which was chloride-coated silver wire in a chamber filled with bath solution, kept the electrical potential of the outer side of the cell membrane at 0 mV. 
The electrical potential of the inner side of the cell membrane was controlled through a patch electrode filled with the intrapipette solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4 Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA). 
Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20kHz, and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, USA). 
Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA). 
All membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential (estimated as `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`12 mV). 
The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. 
Only recordings with stable access resistance lower than 30 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U038F")` were considered acceptable for analysis. 
All drugs were delivered *via* a bath perfusion system. <!-- antibodies? -->
<!--  Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.// The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.-->


#### Electrophysiological identification and classification of chosen neurons
<!-- właściwie nie ruszone... -->
Once the whole-cell recording was obtained, cell characteristics were recorded using current-clamp techniques.
<!-- In order to characterize the electrophysiological features of SuM and PH neurons, we measured the following parameters in response to hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (5pA steps, 500ms) according to Petilla terminology [@ascoli_2008; @karagiannis_2009; @gouwens_2019]:-->
Neurons were identified by location, shape of cell body, firing properties, and morphology (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodpatch)).

##### Electrophysiological identification of principal cells in the BLA
<!-- ewentualnie rozdzielić to na BLA and CeA, ale jedna figura -->
Principal neurons were identified based on their unique electrophysiological properties.<!-- As previously shown ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ), these cells were identified electrophysiologically by using the presence of -->

The principal neurons of the BLA were morphologically identified by their large pyramidal-like cell bodies. When recorded with standard internal solution, all the cells displaying this morphological feature showed varying degrees of spike adaptation. They fired 3–7 times to a depolarizing current step of 500 ms length, which is an electrophysiological characteristic of BLA principal neurons (Sah et al., 2003). Thus, we were confident of recording from the pyramidal cells, even in experiments where cesium-based internal solution was used and we could not verify the spike frequency or waveform to a depolarizing current step. Standard cesium-based internal solution was used for recording AMPAR-mediated sEPSCs at ⫺70 mV

INs were distinguished from PNs ( Figures S1 B–S1E) by using action potential discharge properties ( Mahanty and Sah, 1998 <!-- perumal_2021 -->

Based on literature, we included following criteria: (1) adaptation ratio [@hunt_2017], (2) rheobase and RMS [@hou_2016], 

INs were distinguished from PNs ( Figures S1 B–S1E) by using action potential discharge properties ( Mahanty and Sah, 1998 ) 

##### Electrophysiological identification of neurons in the CeA

The amygdala is comprised of several distinct nuclei ( Fig. 1 A ). In acutely prepared mouse amygdala slices, we identified the CeL by the surrounding axon bundles with IR-DIC optics ( Fig. 1 B ) as described previously ( Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004 ). Neurons in the CeL display heterogeneous intrinsic excitability ( Martina et al., 1999 ; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004 ; Chieng et al., 2006 ; Haubensak et al., 2010 ; Amano et al., 2012 ; Chiang et al., 2015 ). 

In agreement with previous results ( Haubensak et al., 2010 ; Li et al., 2013 ), the majority ( ~ 96%, 217 of 225; Fig. 1 C ) of CeL neurons exhibited either the ES or the LS phenotype in response to depolarizing current steps, whereas only a small subset (3.5%, 8 of 225; Fig. 1 C ) displayed the low threshold-bursting (LTB) phenotype ( Chieng et al., 2006 ). 
<!-- to bardziej do analizy.... 
Based on their response to somatic current injections, three general types of CeL neurons have previously been described, with the two major types being LF neurons, which show a significant delay before onset of the first AP (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`100–200 ms), and early-spiking (ES) neurons (also described as regular-spiking; AP onset, `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`50 ms). 
A third, smaller population of low-threshold bursting neurons has also been described (Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004; Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). 
We characterized the firing properties of 151 CeL neurons. 
However, while classifying neurons we found that AP onset varied with changes in holding potential, whereas the presence of spike frequency accommodation was more reliable. 
Using this measure, neurons were classified either as nonaccommodating (NA), where AP frequency remained relatively consistent (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`17 Hz), or accommodating (Ac), where there was clear spike frequency adaptation (AP1-2, `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`2 Hz; AP7-8, 13 Hz; p < 0.001 Wilcoxon matched-pairs test; Fig. 2C). 
The large majority of our neurons were nonaccommodating (n = 80 neurons; Fig. 2A) or accommodating (n = 59 neurons; Fig. 2B). 
Nonaccommodating neurons also had a significantly longer mean onset compared with that of accommodating neurons (Table 1), and these neurons generally corresponded to the LF and ES types (Hauben- sak et al., 2010; Amano et al., 2012). 
Thus, for consistency we have termed these LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons. 
Apart from resting membrane potential, which was significantly more depolarized in ES-Ac neurons, other membrane properties such as input resistance, threshold potential, AP amplitude, rise time, and half-width did not differ significantly between LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons -Hunt2017 -->

<!--## Clustering

Hierarchical clustering analysis. 
To classify the cells, an unsupervised clustering analysis ( Cauli et al., 2000 ; Jasnow et al., 2009 ; Sosulina et al., 2010 ) was performed by using squared Euclidean distances and Ward’s method ( Ward, 1963 ).
Electrophysiological properties of CeL cells were tested for uniformity in their distributions. 
Each of the quantified 14 variables (listed in Table 1)  was binned and tested by the D’Agostino– Pearson normality test, which is based on the assumption that a variable is normally distributed in a class.  
Variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were used for subsequent unsupervised clustering. 
Hierarchical clustering arranges data items into a tree-like dendrogram in which tree leaves represent data items and the length of tree edges between leaves represents the dissimilarity between data items. 
Tree leaves belonging to a subtree suggest high similarity and therefore form a group. 
Hierarchical clustering operates as follows. 
First, each CeL neuron was transformed into a 4D data point with variables of spike delay, ramp ratio, resting membrane potential (RMP), and rheobase. 
Before clustering, we first normalized variables into the range (0, 1) by performing min–max normalization. The distance between data points represents the dissimilarity between them; closer data points have higher similarity. 
Next, we clustered all the data points by the following iterative procedure. First, assign each data point to a cluster; every cluster therefore contains only one data point. 
Second, merge the two closest clusters into one cluster; therefore, Hou et al., 2016 -->

<!-- According to this criterion following neurons were included in the study on chemokines signaling in the amygdala (only one neuron per slice was subjected to drug administration experiment): /// nie wiem czy to dodawać bo musiałabym obliczyć ;P patrz: ALAN dla reszty gdybym się jednak zdecydowała-->

#### Recording protocols, data analysis, and statistics

Whole-cell patch-clamp is capable of detecting transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration, or measuring membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration. 
Hence, to measure the effects of chemokines (CX3CL1/CXCL12) on intrinsic membrane properties, the experiments were recorded in the whole-cell patch-clamp under the current-clamp configuration. 
First, 5 minutes after breaking into the cell, the resting membrane potential (RMP, 1) was recorded. <!--was recorded immediately after establishing whole-cell configuration.-->
<!--  The input-output relationship was obtained for each neuron using hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms). // was measured immediately after electrical access to the intracellular compartment of the cell was achieved // In order to describe the behavior of recorded neurons comprehensively, 28 electrophysiological parameters were measured on traces corresponding to the voltage responses induced by 800 ms hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses. // -->
<!--The frequency-current (F/I) relationship was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude. // Then the series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses (500ms, from -80 to 100pA in 5pA increments) were injected.Action potentials were evoked in current clamp mode from a holding potential of -65 mV by 500 ms depolarizing current pulses.-->
Then, several membrane parameters were assessed based on neuronal voltage responses from -65 mV holding potential to hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms, 10 or 5pA increments), and analyzed using custom scripts. <!-- In order to characterize the behavior of recorded neurons, 22 electrophysiological parameters were measured-->
(2) Input resistance (R~m~), (3) membrane time constant (`r knitr::asis_output("\U03C4")`~m~), and (4) membrane capacitance (C~m~) were determined in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses eliciting voltage shifts whose amplitude was 10–15 mV negative to rest.<!-- (Kawaguchi 1993) // inne cytowanie--> 
R~m~ was measured following Ohms law and `r knitr::asis_output("\U03C4")`~m~ was determined at the beginning of the voltage response and computed by fitting it to a single exponential.<!-- the membrane time constant  (determined at the beginning of the voltage response of a hyperpolarization current pulse of 10 pA; the time constant was determined by fitting this voltage response to a single exponential),// was computed as the time constant of a single exponential fit of the voltage response from onset to maximum hyperpolarization -->
C~m calculated according to the equation C~m~= $\frac{\tau~m~}{R~m~}$).<!-- Cm was obtained following the formula Cm = τm/Rm. --> 
<!-- SAG? Some neurons have been described to undergo a partial repolarization following a hyperpolarization peak in response to negative currents, reflecting the activation of the voltage-activated cationic current (Ih). In order to quantify this phenomenon, the maximal resistance Rmax was computed as the slope of a linear curve fitted to the current–voltage (IV) plot of the maximal voltage response of recorded neurons to hyperpolarizing current injections ranging from −100 to 0 pA with a 10 mV increment. Similarly, the steady state resistance Rsag was estimated as the slope of a linear curve fitted to the IV plot of the steady state voltage response to hyperpolarizing currents measured at the end of 800 ms pulses (Karagiannis et al. 2009). (5) Sag index was computed to correspond to Rsag expressed as a percentage of Rmax. -->
Cell excitability was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a linear regression model (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodIV), parts a and b).
The gain (slope, 5) and rheobase (minimal current necessary to fire the first action potential, 6) parameters were determined for further analysis.
<!-- To take into account the possible variety of firing patterns, such as bursting, adapting, regular or irregular trains of action potentials, the interspaced intervals were measured for response to the the minimal current injection eliciting more than three action potentials and the following parameters were measured:--> <!-- [@ascoli_2008; @karagiannis_2009]-->
<!-- In order to characterize the behavior of recorded neurons, several electrophysiological parameters were measured, as follows:-->
Action potential threshold corresponded to the voltage threshold of the first action potential elicited by a current step, defined as the voltage at which the time derivative of V~m~($\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}$) is 20 V s^−1^. 
<!--(6) The rheobase (the minimal depolarizing current pulse intensity that elicited an action potential),--> 
(7) the first spike latency (measured at rheobase as the time needed to elicit the first action potential),
(8) amplitudes of the first and (9) second action potential (AP; measured from the threshold to the positive peak of the rheobase), 
(10) AP width (measured at half-amplitude<!--measured at the threshold of action potentials and spike amplitude from the threshold to the peak.-->), 
(11) maximal firing rate (F~max~, defined as the trace with the largest number of action potentials), 
(12) the amplitude of the fast after-hyperpolarization (AHP~f~; measured for the first spike), 
(13a) the presence of post-inhibitory rebound, 
(13b) its amplitude, 
(13c) duration and 
(13d) the number of AP elicited by a post-inhibitory rebound following hyperpolarizing current of 80 pA from -65 mV, 
(14a) the occurrence of spontaneous firing, 
(14b) its frequency, 
(14c) amplitude, and 
(14d) coefficient variance (CV).
When neurons did not exhibit some of the abovementioned features, they were arbitrarily set to 0.
All of these parameters are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:methodIV)).

<!-- Alan
The voltage response to a 50 pA current pulse (500 ms) was utilised to calculate the following: (1) the membrane time constant, which was determined by fitting a single exponential to the charging phase of the voltage response; (2) the membrane resistance, which was calculated based on the maximum amplitude of the voltage response, assuming an ohmic current-voltage (I-V) relationship; and (3) the membrane capacitance, which was calculated as the quotient of the time constant and resistance. (4) The voltage sag was measured from the voltage response to a -140 pA hyperpolarising current step (500 ms).
(5) The voltage-current relationship was traced based on steady-state voltage responses to decremental hyperpolarising current pulses from -140 pA to -10 pA (10 pA decrement, pulse duration 500 ms, 5 seconds between steps). (6) Neuronal excitability (input-output relationship) was measured as the number of spikes elicited by incremental depolarising current pulses from +10 pA to +140 pA (10 pA increment, pulse duration 500 ms, 5 seconds between steps). Only current steps triggering APs were used to characterize the input-output relationship.-->
<!-- Therefore, the amplitude (21–24) and the latency (25–28) of the first (AHPf) and second (AHPs) components of afterhyperpolarization was measured for the first two action potentials as the difference between spike threshold and the negative peak of the AHP (Kawaguchi, 1993). 
In some cortical neurons (Haj-Dahmane and Andrade, 1997), this complex repolarization is accompanied by a fast afterdepolarization (ADP). 
Its (29, 30) amplitude and (31, 32) latency were measured as the difference between the negative peak of the AHPf and the positive peak of the ADP and between the spike threshold and the peak of the ADP, respectively. When neurons did not exhibit AHPs or ADP, amplitude and latency were arbitrarily set to 0. @karagiannis_2009-->

In another sets of experiments, in the voltage-clamp configuration were aimed at investigating the influence of either CX3CR1 or CXCR4 receptors activation on spontaneous/miniature inhibitory/excitatory synaptic currents were performed in normal ACSF and ACSF containing TTX (500 nM), respectively (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)). 
The details of additional experimental conditions are provided in Results (\@ref(results)). <!-- wytlumaczyć skróty podobnie jak chemokiny (sEPSC/mEPSC/sIPSC/mIPSC)-->
<!-- The calculated reversal potential for Cl- currents in these patch-clamp recordings equalled -90.51 mV, pominąć raczej -->
At holding potential of -70mV, inward events represented excitatory postsynaptic currents (Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)a), whereas to record inhibitory postsynaptic currents, neurons were voltage-clamped at 0 mV (Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)b).
After 10 min of the stabilization period, the baseline postsynaptic current activity was recorded. 
The action of chosen chemokine was assessed by adding a known concentration of a stock solution directly to the bath and taking the measures before (baseline) and during 15 min of chemokine superfusion.
For analysis, the 4-minute-long recordings from baseline and after 15 minutes of chemokine application was selected.<!--The nature of postsynaptic currents was verified using glutamate (10 μM CNQX, 50 μM DL-AP5 and GABA (20 μM bicuculline) receptor antagonists (Fig. M2 B, C)  chyba mam tylko bicuculine... może jakaś zamykająca się komórka...? albo któryś z fluorocitrate? albo jakaś tomkowa, ktora nic nie ma? -->
From detected events, their median frequency, amplitude, rise time, and decay time were measured (see Fig. \@ref(fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC)).
These parameters were statistically tested (baseline versus chemokine application). 
Group data for excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as median`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")`SD. 

At first, postsynaptic currents were detected using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., USA) or TaroTools toolbox for Igor Pro (https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister, v8.0.4, USA).
However, these software required subjective selection of the threshold amplitude of events and visual inspection of the researcher to prevent the inclusion of false data.
It leads to semi-automatic approach, which might be prone to error and researcher bias.
Thus, a machine learning-based approach was used by using Eventer [@winchester_giles_2020], which allowed training a model to implement consistent selection criteria across data sets without bias.
The same traces were analyzed by using all of these software and selection based on models trained in Eventer was the most rigorous, thereby the occurrence of false positive events is less likely.
Importantly, the differences between the control and experimental conditions remained unchanged (data not shown). 
Hence, the synaptic transmission data presented in this dissertation was done using machine-learning approach in Eventer software.

#### Post-recording immunostaining

In order to verify the neurochemical content of recorded neurons,  after recording a subset of slices was fixed overnight with a 4% formaldehyde at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C and stained according to the following protocol.  
In brief, free-floating sections were blocked and permeabilized (10% normalized goat serum (NGS; Jackson ImuunoResearch), 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS) at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C overnight and incubated with a primary antibodies solution supplemented with a streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen; 1:500) overnight at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C. <!--: mouse anti-OXT (1:1000 or 1:10000), rabbit anti-AVP (1:500 or 1:5000), ExtrAvidin-Cy3 (1:200), 2% NDS, 0.3% Tx100 in PBS, // Next, several rinses with PBS were carried out before incubating slices with  and blocking and permeabilizing with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS; ) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (Sigma Aldrich; blocking solution) overnight at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C.-->
Next, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody mixture for 24 h at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C <!--(2% NDS in PBS solution containing donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody (1:400) and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (1:400)). -->
To stain the cell nuclei, the NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher, Inc.) was used.
Finally, slices were mounted onto microscope slides using Prolong Glass antifading medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen). <!-- Stained sections were mounted and coverslipped with -->
Each step was followed by a 3x 10 min PBS wash.
Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 fluorescence microscope with an Apotome.2 system using Zen Pro 2 software (Zeiss).

##### Sulphoramine staining

To verify the effects of fluorocitrate on brain slices, the sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) staining was utilized. 
The protocol was adapted from previous studies on acute brain slices [@christian_2013; @kafitz_2008].
Briefly, a subset of 250`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick slices was prepared as for electrophysiology, with some slices incubated in 100 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M fluorocitrate (FC) for 30 min at room temperature as described above. 
Slices were incubated in 1 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M SR101 (Sigma-Aldrich, <!-- kraj-->) in oxygenated ACSF for 20 min at 34 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, then washed in ACSF for at least 10 min at 34 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C. <!-- adapted a protocol for application-->
The slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and processed for immunocytochemistry, as described above. 

### Extracellular recordings, data acquisition and statistics

As the BLA is widely known to be involved in emotional learning and memory, and mounting evidence points to CX3CL1 as a crucial player in these phenomena, additional experiments investigating the role of CX3CL1 in the BLA LTP was performed.
Slices containing the BLA were transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a recording ACSF (33.5 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 0.5`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C), the same as for patch-clamp recordings. 
Recordings began approx. 2.5 h after slice preparation.

For field potentials (FPs) recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode and a recording electrode  were visually positioned under a dissecting microscope in the external capsule and the basolateral region of the amygdala, respectively,  as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:methodpatch) 
A Pt-Ir electrode (CBARC85, FHC) was utilized for stimulation, whereas recordings were made using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–2 M`r knitr::asis_output("\U03A9")`), pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a List-Medical L/M 3P-A micropipette puller.
The recording electrode was introduced 150`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m into the slice within the BLA.
Stimuli (duration: 0.2 ms) were applied at 0.016 Hz using a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (WPI).
Signals<!--FPs--> were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, USA), filtered (1-500 Hz), A/D converted at 10 kHz and stored using the Micro1401 interface and SIGAVG software (CED, UK).
A stimulus–response (input–output) curve was obtained for each slice.
For that purpose, stimulation intensity was progressively elevated step-wise (16 steps; 0–100 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`A). 
In all experiments, baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of sufficient intensity<!--(300 e 800mA)--> to elicit a response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field potentials, which was fixed at this level throughout all experiments.
Stimulus-response curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: V~i~= V~max~ /(1 + exp((u-uh)/-S)), with V~max~ being the maximum FP amplitude; u—stimulation  intensity;  uh—stimulation  intensity  evoking  the  FP  of  half-maximum amplitude; S—factor proportional to the slope of the curve.

To measure the short-term plasticity, the paired-pulse stimulation protocol was used (duration—0.2 ms, inter-stimulus interval ISI—50ms).
The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the second FP to the amplitude of the first FP.

Once a stable baseline of responses had been obtained for at least 15 min, the LTP was induced applying theta burst stimulation (TBS).
It consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz, repeated five times every 25 s. 
Each train consisted of five pulses at 100 Hz. 
During TBS, pulse duration was extended to 0.2 ms. 
fEPSPs were recorded at 0.016 Hz for another hour.
LTP was defined as an increase in the amplitude of the fEPSPs. 
Averaged fEPSP amplitudes recorded between 45min and 60 min after the last burst were normalized to averaged baseline (the first 15 min of recording) and expressed as a percentage. 
The health of the slice was monitored by continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout experiments. 
Slices displaying unstable baseline recording were discarded. 
Data are presented as group means `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` SEM. 

## Immunohistochemistry

### Tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry

Rats (n = 12) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously [@makowiak_2011].
After a post-fixation period of 12 h, 50  `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m-thick sections of the brain were cut in the coronal plane using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000). 

### Immunofluorescence staining

To analyze co-localization of chemokines (CX3CL1 or CXCL12) or chemokine receptors (CXCR4 or CX3CR1) with neurons<!--inaczej to ująć bo nie tylko neurons--> in the BLA or CeA, slices containing amygdala were initially washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and then blocked for 1 h (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS).

<!--Subsequently, immunohistochemical labeling was detected with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and an Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.  zmienić ... -->

Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse anti-CD11b FITC-conjugated antibody. 
Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) and AMCA-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.

Next, brain sections were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and CX3CL1, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCL12 and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.<!-- zmienić ...// Slices were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rabbit; 1:500 dilution; Invitrogen A-11011). -->

<!-- when writing about validation??? CHEMOKINE INTERACTIONS WITH THE SEROTONIN AND OPIOID SYSTEMS: ANATOMICAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE RAT BRAIN
A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002)./// To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002). /// The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007). A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - - PHD thesis ///
The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).-->

Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with omission of primary antibodies and no specific staining was detected (data not shown). <!-- Appendix? -->

### Image analysis 

In order to address the co-localization between cell type markers and chemokines/CKRs of interest,  fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with the Apotome.2 optical sectioning module (Carl Zeiss) 63x/1.4 oil immersion plan apochromatic objective.<!-- dodać, że niektóre 20x? // Briefly,  stacks of 20 images were obtained under a LSM710 Zeiss confocal microscope (63x Oil immersion objective, Z-axis interval: 0.4 mm, XY dimensions: 79.38 mm).-->
Three-channel images were acquired <!--(DAPI, CD68 and Iba1)-->. 
<!--For each image, a fixed value threshold was applied to the Iba1 channel, and then the threshold image was converted in a Selection.
A Mean filter (2 pixels) was applied in order to delete precipitates of the secondary antibody. 
The selection was then loaded in the CD68 channel. 
Selections were inverted in both channels, and the exterior of the cells was filled with black paint.  -->

All image analysis, cell counts and fluorescence measurements were performed “off-line” on captured images taken from stained sections using open source Fiji<!--citation?--> imaging software.<!-- Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji32 and QuPath33 imaging software. -->
<!-- For fluorescent images, z-stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells was quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. -->
The total numbers of positively identified cells expressing either chosen marker of chemokine/CKR of interest were counted manually in individual brain sections.<!-- from 3 rats in each treatment group. -->
<!--Resulting images were then processed with the Just Another Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) in ImageJ, as previously described (Llorens-Martin et al., 2016). -->
The number of cells was counted  separately in the central and basolateral amygdala.<!--PV+ interneurons were counted in the DG. To this end, the area including the GL, ML and the H was contoured on confocal stacks of images, and the number of PV+ cells surrounded by PNNs within that contour were counted in each stack of images. The number of cells was then divided by the drawn area, and cell density (cells/mm3) was represented in the graphs. Bolos2018 --> 
The percentage of MCH neurons that express CXCR4 in a given nucleus was calculated as the ratio of the number of double labelled CXCR4 ⁄ MCH over that of MCH-positive cells.<!--The percentage of colocalization between the two channels (Iba1+ area that was also CD68+ (Mander’s coefficient M1)) is represented in the graphs.--><!-- All cells with a positive BaseScope signal were quantified and represent 100% of labelled cells; the percentages of single- or double-positive cells were determined.--><!--For immunohistochemical experiments, results are expressed as percentage of CXCR7/Olig2- positive cells compared to the total number of CXCR7-EGFP cells in the SVZ (n=6).  zmienić jeszcze trochę -->

<!--Briefly, six stacks of images per animal were used to determine the density of mature granule neurons in a reference structure of known volume (30 (X) ? 30 (Y) ? 10 (Z) lm). The average density of these cells was then multiplied by either the total volume of the DG (in the case of the number of mature granule neurons) or by the length of the subgranular zone (SGZ) (in the case of the number of DCX+ neuroblasts) in order to calculate the total number of cells per animal (Llorens-Martin et al., 2006). Bolos2018-->
<!-- Assessment was performed by independent blinded investigators who quantified the total number of activated microglia. The numbers of activated microglia in each treatment group were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted. --><!-- In the other cases, quantification has been validated by two independent people. -->
<!-- Brightfield images have been acquired using a Widefield Observer (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer) slide scanner. -->
<!--For cell quantification of fluorescent images and brightfield images in which no automated quantification was possible, a minimum of eight randomly chosen regions of equal dimensions per rat and region were acquired.
Total cell numbers per mm2 were calculated based on the image dimensions. -->
<!-- For quantification of the single-channel brightfield images and the BaseScope IHC double-positive images, the number of cells was also quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. -->
<!-- The average of these different regions was taken and considered as n = 1. 
Where possible, brightfield images were quantified automatically. 
Therefore, whole slides were scanned using a slide scanner. 
Using QuPath, a minimum of four random regions per sample and condition were annotated, and cells within these regions were quantified using the automated ‘positive cell detection’ plugin.-->
<!--For the quantification of the duplex BaseScope, random brightfield images were acquired in the white matter of control donors. -->

All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 [@R_base], with mainly the dplyr (v0.8.3; @dplyr), and the ggplot2 (v3.2.1; @ggplot2) packages. <!-- poprawić --> 
Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05.
Following verification of a normal distribution, Student’s paired t-test was used to compare parametric data from two groups. <!-- może dodać jakim testem?// All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 [@R_base], the dplyr (v0.8.3; @dplyr), and the ggplot2 (v3.2.1; @ggplot2) packages. 
Group data for inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as median$\pm$SD.

We employed the rabbit anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs) to avoid species cross-reactivity during the combined application of SDF-1α and CXCR4 antibodies.

We characterized mouse visual cortex neurons with a uniform experimental protocol and developed an unsupervised classification scheme of cell types based on electrophysiology and morphology.
Every aspect of the pipeline, from slice preparation, recording, and stimulation, to staining, imaging, reconstruction, and mapping of cells to a reference atlas, employed highly standardized and quality-controlled methodology. 

Extracellular recordings from the LA and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. /// analogous

Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. 

Although such experiments were not performed until now in the CA1 region the TBS protocol seems to be suited to apply in this experiment on the basis of the laminated structure of the CA1 region. 

Therefore, we decided to apply HFS in the LA and TBS in the CA1 region after induction of LTD to maximize the potentiation levels and enhance the chance to detect differences between the groups. 

That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. 

The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP.

<!-- Watanabe et al. (1995) have carried out intracellular recordings of evoked potentials and confirmed that the latency of peak negative field potentials corresponds well with that of intracellularly recorded action potentials, indicating that the extracellularly recorded sharp negativity seems to be a population spike. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the amplitude of field potentials. 
Additionally, the slope measure in the lateral amygdala is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal, making it more difficult to analyze (Doyere et al., 2003). 
Thus, we also decided to record PS in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, to get a better comparison of results between these two limbic structures. 
Single or paired stimuli (duration 100 μ s) were presented every 10 s. -->
