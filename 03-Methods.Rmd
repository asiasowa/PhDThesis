## General

### Ethic approval
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 
Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15 January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal Research (Krakow, Poland). 
All efforts were made to minimize suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

### Animals

Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Research Models and Services; Germany).
Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm) in controlled environment (22 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 1`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, 45 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` 5 % relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) with commercial food and fresh water *ad libitum*. 
Animals were acclimated to the housing environment for at least 4 days before the beginning of the experiments. 
Rats were weighing 180-300g (5-10 weeks of age) during the tissue preparation. 
Animals at this age are considered as young adults.  


### Reagents

All drugs used for electrophysiological experiments were bath applied by gravity or a peristaltic pump. 
Fractalkine 2 and 5nM according to studies @Sheridan2014
The time necessary for the solution to flow from the stopcocks to the slice was approximately 15 s. The drugs used were minocycline, 100 lM doxycycline (a second-generation tetracycline), 100 lM DL-fluorocitric acid barium salt (a selective astrocyte inhibitor), 10 lM CNQX (an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist), 50 lM APV (an NMDA receptor antagonist), 0.5–1 lM tetrodotoxin (TTX, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker), 10–40 lM bicuculline methiodide (a GABAA receptor antagonist), 1–2 lM strychnine (a glycine receptor antagonist), 100 lM NiCl2 (a low voltage- activated calcium channel blocker), and 100 lM CdCl2 (a high voltage-activated calcium channel blocker). Minocycline and doxycycline were freshly dissolved in Krebs solution at the final concentration before perfusion. A stock of fluorocitrate was prepared from DL- fluorocitric acid barium salt as previously described (Wenker et al., 2010). A stock of CNQX was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the other drugs were prepared in distilled water at 1000 times the concentrations to be used and stored at -20 °C as in our previous study (Liu et al., 2015). The drugs were diluted to the final concentration in Krebs solution just before use. Doxycycline, CNQX, APV, and TTX were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The determination of the doses for minocycline was based on a previous study in which 100 $\upmu$M minocycline markedly reduced the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in hippocampal neurons (Gonzalez et al., 2007). - Peng2016



## Whole-cell patch-clamp technique in acute brain slices

### Tissue Preparation {#decap}

Male Wistar (4-7-week-old) rats were anesthetised with isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m. 
Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF (artifical cerebrospinal–fluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO~3~, 1.4 NaH~2~PO~4~, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl~2~, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O~2~/5% CO~2~), pH 7.4; osmolality 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and cut into 300 $\upmu$m thick coronal sections on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). 
After slicing, brain slices containing amygdala were transfered and held in an incubation chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolality 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^). 
Slices were incubated at 31–33 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT).
After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of an Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min) with carbogenated, warm (32`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30 NaHCO~3~, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2 CaCl~2~, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO~4~ and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35; osmolality 290–300 mOsmol kg^−1^).


### Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition

Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC). 
The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD camera and displayed on a computer monitor. 
The border of basolateral or central amygdala were identified based on visual control by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos Atlas [@Paxinos2007], corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal to bregma \ref{photoneuronDIC}. 
Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. 
Cells were approached under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland). 
Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (3–6 MΩ; Sutter Instruments, USA) using horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments P–97) and filled with following solutions. 

 <!-- ![Figure caption \label{photoneuronDIC}](images\zdjeciedic40x.png) -->
 
For experiment measuring excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability, the intrapippete solution contained (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl~2~, 2 MgCl~2~, 5 Na~2~ATP, 0.4 Na~3~GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, osmolality 290-300 mOsmol kg^−1^) and biocytin (0.1%, for subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). 
For experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na~2~, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35; osmolality 280-290 mOsmol kg^−1^.

The pipette was positively pressurized by applying a mouth suction to help prevent contamination of the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity of the membrane keeping a positive pressure. 
After forming a high-resistance seal (> 1 G$\Omega$, cell-atached configuration) between the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure, a second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of membrane enclosed with the pipette's tip and access inside of the neuron. 
An electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode was established (whole-cell configuration). 
After break-in, cells stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly diffuses from the pipette into cytoplasm.
Ground electrode, which was chloride-coated silver wire in chamber filled with bath solution, kept the electrical potential of the outer side of cell membrane at 0 mV. 
Electrical potential of the inner side of cell membrane was controlled through an patch electrode filled with intrapipette solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4 Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA). 
Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20kHz and sampled through an analogue-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, USA). 
Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA). 
Voltages were corrected for the liquid-junction potential (estimated as ~12 mV). 
The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. 
Only recordings with stable access resistance lower than 30 MΩ were considered acceptable for analysis. 
All peptides and drugs were delivered via a bath perfusion system.

### Electrophysiological identification and classification of chosen neurons

As previously shown ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ), these cells were identified electrophysiologically by using the presence of 

Whole-cell patch-clamp is capable of detecting transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration, or measuring membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration. 
Once the whole-cell recording was obtained, cell characteristics were recorded using current-clamp techniques. 
The input-output relationship was obtained for each neuron using hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms). 
The frequency-current (F/I) relationship was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude.

#### Electrophysiological identification of principal cells in the BLA

Principal neurons were identified based on their unique electrophysiological properties.

#### Electrophysiological identification of late-firing cells in the CeA

Based on their response to somatic current injections, three general types of CeL neurons have previously been described, with the two major types being LF neurons, which show a significant delay before onset of the first AP (⬃100–200 ms), and early-spiking (ES) neurons (also described as regular-spiking; AP onset, ⬃50 ms). 
A third, smaller population of low-threshold bursting neurons has also been described (Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004; Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). We characterized the firing properties of 151 CeL neurons. However, while classifying neurons we found that AP onset varied with changes in holding potential, whereas the presence of spike fre- quency accommodation was more reliable. Using this measure, neurons were classified either as nonaccommo- dating (NA), where AP frequency remained relatively con- sistent (⬃17 Hz), or accommodating (Ac), where there was clear spike frequency adaptation (AP1-2, ⬃32 Hz; AP7-8, 13 Hz; p ⬍ 0.001 Wilcoxon matched-pairs test; Fig. 2C). The large majority of our neurons were nonaccom- modating (n ⫽ 80 neurons; Fig. 2A) or accommodating (n ⫽ 59 neurons; Fig. 2B). Nonaccommodating neurons also had a significantly longer mean onset compared with that of accommodating neurons (Table 1), and these neurons generally corresponded to the LF and ES types (Hauben- sak et al., 2010; Amano et al., 2012). Thus, for consistency we have termed these LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons. Apart from resting membrane potential, which was significantly more depolarized in ES-Ac neurons, other membrane properties such as input resistance, threshold potential, AP amplitude, rise time, and half-width did not differ significantly between LF-NA and ES-Ac neurons -Hunt2017

#### Electrophysiological identification of regular-firing cells in the CeA

### Recording protocols and data analysis

The frequency-current (F/I) relationship was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a linear regression model. 
The gain (slope) and rheobase (minimal current necessary to fire the first action potential) parameters will be determined for further analysis.


### Post-recording immunostaining

In order to examine neurochemical content of recorded neurons, after recording a subset of slices was fixed overnight with a 4% formaldehyde at 4°C and stained according to following protocol.
In brief, free-floating sections were blocked and permeabilised (10% normalised donkey serum (NDS), 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS) at 4°C overnight and incubated with a primary antibodies solution supplemented with an ExtrAvidin-Cy3 conjugate <!--: mouse anti-OXT (1:1000 or 1:10000), rabbit anti-AVP (1:500 or 1:5000), ExtrAvidin-Cy3 (1:200), 2% NDS, 0.3% Tx100 in PBS, --> overnight at 4°C.
Finally, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody mixture for 24 h at 4°C <!--(2% NDS in PBS solution containing donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody (1:400) and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (1:400)). -->
Each step was followed by a PBS wash. 
Stained sections were mounted and coverslipped with <!--Vectashield, and imaged with an Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss) confocal laser microscope or Imager.M2 (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope.-->


## Extracellular recording and LTP

## Immunohistochemistry

A subset of brains were stained for NeuN to visualize neuronal nuclei. 
After intracardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, brains were postfixed overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS. 
After the brains sank, sagittal slices (40 µ m) were prepared using a cryostat and mounted onto glass slides. 
Slices were washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and then blocked for 1 h (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS). 
Primary antibody (rabbit anti-NeuN, diluted 1:1,000; Millipore ABN78) was dissolved in carrier solution (1% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) and applied overnight. 
Slices were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rabbit; 1:500 dilution; Invitrogen A-11011). 
Sections were washed in PBS three more times before the slides were cover slipped with Vectashield with DAPI.

The specificity of the staining or antibodies was tested in previous studies (Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005).

# Antibodies

Details regarding the primary and secondary antibodies used in our immunohistochemistry experiments are provided in Table ....

<!-- table caption The table provides information about the primary antibodies used in our immunolabeling studies including the primary antibody species, clonality, dilution, and catalog number.

A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to
19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002).

To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat
antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002). 

The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007).


A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat
CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - CHEMOKINE INTERACTIONS WITH THE SEROTONIN AND OPIOID SYSTEMS: ANATOMICAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE RAT BRAIN - PHD thesis

The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we
used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).

Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with omission of primary antibodies and no specific staining was detected (data not shown).

### Immmunohistochemistry

To analyze co-localization of chemokines (SDF-1α or fractalkine) or chemokine
receptors (CXCR4 or CX3CR1) with serotonergic neurons, midbrain slices were initially incubated with either goat anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-CXCR4 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-fractalkine antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs, East Orange, NJ) overnight at 4oC. Sections were incubated in mouse anti-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) antibody (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4oC. Subsequently, immunohistochemical labeling was detected with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and an Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.

CX3CR1 localization to neurons and glia was determined by a sequential
incubation of brain slices with a rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs), mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and mouse anti- CD11b FITC-conjugated antibody (1:100; Chemicon). Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4oC, and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse anti-CD11b FITC-conjugated antibody. Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) and AMCA-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.

Chemokine and chemokine receptor co-localization in the raphe nuclei was
examined by incubating brain slices with antibodies directed towards either SDF-1α and CXCR4 or fractalkine and CX3CR1. We employed the rabbit anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs) to avoid species cross-reactivity during the combined application of SDF-1α and CXCR4 antibodies. Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4oC. Next, brain sections were placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and fractalkine, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect SDF-1α and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.

For all immunohistochemical experiments, brain sections were rinsed with PB
solution (3 x 10 min) between incubations. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and cover slipped with Prolong Gold Antifade



### Cell counting

The total number of cells, Iba1+ microglia, <!--Parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons and DCX+ neuroblasts--> were calculated under a <!--LSM710 Zeiss confocal--> microscope <!--(63x Oil immersion objective for all the cell counts except for PV+ interneurons, which were analyzed under a 25X Oil immersion objective)--> using the apotome<!--physical dissector method adapted for confocal microscopy (Llorens-Martin et al., 2013).-->
<!--Briefly, six stacks of images per animal were used to determine the density of mature granule neurons in a reference structure of known volume (30 (X) ? 30 (Y) ? 10 (Z) lm). The average density of these cells was then multiplied by either the total volume of the DG (in the case of the number of mature granule neurons) or by the length of the subgranular zone (SGZ) (in the case of the number of DCX+ neuroblasts) in order to calculate the total number of cells per animal (Llorens-Martin et al., 2006). Bolos2018-->
The number of cells was counted in central and basolateral amygdala separately. 
<!--PV+ interneurons were counted in the DG. 
To this end, the area including the GL, ML and the H was contoured on confocal stacks of images, and the number of PV+ cells surrounded by PNNs within that contour were counted in each stack of images. The number of cells was then divided by the drawn area, and cell density (cells/mm3) was represented in the graphs. Bolos2018 -->
In order to address <!-- microglial activation-->, we measured <!--CD68--> expression by immunohistochemistry in cells located in the central and basolateral amygdala. 
Briefly, <!--confocal--> stacks of 20 images were obtained under a <!--LSM710 Zeiss confocal microscope (63x Oil immersion objective, Z-axis interval: 0.4 mm, XY dimensions: 79.38 mm).-->
Three-channel images were acquired <!--(DAPI, CD68 and Iba1)-->. 
For each image, a fixed value threshold was applied to the Iba1 channel, and then the threshold image was converted in a Selection.
A Mean filter (2 pixels) was applied in order to delete precipitates of the secondary antibody. 
The selection was then loaded in the CD68 channel. 
Selections were inverted in both channels, and the exterior of the cells was filled with black paint. 
Resulting images were then processed with the Just Another Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) in ImageJ, as previously described (Llorens-Martin et al., 2016). 
The percentage of colocalization between the two channels (Iba1+ area that was also CD68+ (Mander’s coefficient M1)) is represented in the graphs.


######################################################################################################################
All image analysis, cell counts and fluorescence measurements
were performed “off-line” on captured images taken from stained sections. The total numbers of positively identified activated microglia expressing Iba-1 were counted manually in individual spinal cord sections from 3 rats in each treatment group. Microglia were defined as activated if they displayed a clearly swollen cell body with reduced processes, these differ from normal or resting microglia where cell bodies were largely absent and large ramified processes were displayed. Assessment was performed by inde- pendent blinded investigators who quantified the total number of activated microglia. The numbers of activated microglia in each treatment group were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted. For

We characterized mouse visual cortex neurons with a uniform experimental  protocol and developed an unsupervised classification scheme of  cell types based on electrophysiology and morphology.
Every aspect  of the pipeline, from slice preparation, recording, and stimulation,  to staining, imaging, reconstruction, and mapping of cells to a reference atlas, employed highly standardized and quality-controlled  methodology. 

All membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potential ( $\sim$ 11 mV).


 Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were  considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.
 
 
 The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.
 
Therefore, the amplitude (21–24) and the latency (25–28) of the first (AHPf) and second (AHPs) components of afterhyperpolarization was measured for the first two action potentials as the difference between spike threshold and the negative peak of the AHP (Kawaguchi, 1993). In some cortical neurons (Haj-Dahmane and Andrade, 1997), this complex repolarization is accompanied by a fast afterdepolarization (ADP). Its (29, 30) amplitude and (31, 32) latency were measured as the difference between the negative peak of the AHPf and the positive peak of the ADP and between the spike threshold and the peak of the ADP, respectively. When neurons did not exhibit AHPs or ADP, amplitude and latency were arbitrarily set to 0. @karagiannis_2009


Whole-cell recordings in mouse PNs, held  at y 70  to y 75  mV,  showed  spontaneous  synaptic inward  currents  that  were  mainly  inhibitory  postsynaptic  currents   IPSCs   as  they  were  drastically  reduced  in  the  presence  of  bicuculline   10–20 m M ,  a  potent  blocker  of GABA    receptor, and were little affected by the presenceA . of  CNQX   20 m M ,  a  blocker  of  AMPA  type  glutamate receptors  Llano et al., 1991a,b; Kano et al., 1992 .


We performed immunohistochemistry on CXCR7-EGFP transgenic mice to further characterize the types of cells expressing CXCR7 in adult mouse brain. Using cell type specific markers, CXCR7 expression was mainly found in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells. 

Around 75% of the GABA-responsive neurones showed responsiveness to MCP-1/CCL2. The effect was not inhibited when GTP was omitted from the patch  pipette  medium  (Fig. 8b,  right).

The percentage of MCH neurons that express CXCR4 in a given field was calculated as the ratio of the number of double labelled CXCR4 ⁄ MCH over that of MCH-positive cells

## Clustering

Hierarchical clustering analysis. To classify the cells, an unsupervised clustering analysis (  Cauli et al., 2000  ;  Jasnow et al., 2009  ;  Sosulina et al., 2010  ) was performed by using squared Euclidean distances and Ward’s method (  Ward, 1963  ). Electrophysiological properties of CeL cells were tested for uniformity in their distributions. Each of the quantified 14 variables (listed in  Table 1  ) was binned and tested by the D’Agostino– Pearson normality test, which is based on the assumption that a variable is normally distributed in a class. Variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were used for subsequent unsupervised clustering. Hierarchical clustering arranges data items into a tree-like dendrogram in which tree leaves represent data items and the length of tree edges between leaves represents the dissimilarity between data items. Tree leaves belonging to a subtree suggest high similarity and therefore form a group. Hierarchical clustering operates as follows. First, each CeL neuron was transformed into a 4D data point with variables of spike delay, ramp ratio, resting membrane potential (RMP), and rheobase. Before clustering, we first normalized variables into the range (0, 1) by performing min–max normalization. The distance between data points represents the dissimilarity between them; closer data points have higher similarity. Next, we clustered all the data points by the following iterative procedure. First, assign each data point to a cluster; every cluster therefore contains only one data point. Second, merge the two closest clusters into one cluster; therefore, Hou et al., 2016

## Sulphoramine staining

For sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) staining [@christian_2013. @nimmerjahn_2004, @kafitz_2008], 250-μm-thick slices were prepared as for electrophysiology, with some slices incubated in 100 μM fluorocitrate (FC) for 30 min at room temperature as described above. 
Slices were incubated in 1 μM SR101 (Sigma-Aldrich, <!-- kraj-->) in oxygenated ACSF for 20 min at 34 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, then washed in ACSF for at least 10 min at 34 `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C. 
The slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, washed in PBS,<!--resectioned to 50-μm thickness,--> and processed for GFAP and NeuN immunoreactivity.
Z-stacks of images with an optical distance of 0.5 μm were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510) using a 40× oil-immersion objective. 
Secondary antibodies tagged to fluorescein 488 and Cy3 were excited with 488- and
594- nm lasers and observed through 510–530 and 560–615
emission filters, respectively. A pinhole of 1 Airy unit and
identical settings for the detector gain and amplifier offset were
used to capture all confocal images 

For  determination  of  the  amount  of  SR101-positive  cells on  the  total  number  of  cells  exhibiting  glial  morphology, slices were double-labeled with SR101 and the ester form of sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI), a conventional Na+-selective fluorescent dye that exhibits similar properties as Fura-2 ( Meier et al., 2006 ). To this end, SBFI-AM (800 M) was repeatedly (1–5 s duration each) pressure-injected through a  fine-tipped  glass  microelectrode  into  the stratum  radiatum ( Stosiek et al., 2003 ). Injection was followed by a 45–60 min wash  in  normal  ACSF  at  room  temperature  to  allow  for  diffusion  and  de-esterification  of  the  dye.  Stacks  of  images  (31 optical sections at 1 or 1.5 m thickness) were then taken at a custom build two-photon laser scanning microscope (excitation wavelength at 850 nm) based on an Olympus FV300 system (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany), coupled to a Mai-Tai Broadband  laser  (Spectra  Physics,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  and equipped  with  two  fluorescence  detection  channels.  Fluorescence emission of SBFI was collected between 400 and 590 nm, emission of SR101 was detected between 610 and 630 nm. Maximum intensity projections and analyses of the staining patterns were performed at montages of image stacks using “ImageJ”software. @kafitz_2008

Experiments were carried out on acute tissue slices (250  m) of rat hippocampi harvested at postnatal days 3, 7, 15, and 24–27 as described earlier ( Meier et al., 2006 ). In brief, animals were decapitated and the hippocampi were rapidly removed. Slices of P3 and P7 animals were sectioned in ice-cold normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2and 5% CO2; pH 7.4). Following sectioning, slices were kept at 34◦C for 20 min in ACSF that contained 0.5–1  M sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), followed by a 10 min incubation in normal ACSF at 34◦C. Preparation of slices from animals older than 15 days as well as their incubation with SR101 at high temperature was performed in ACSF with a reduced Ca2+ concentration (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2and 5% CO2; pH 7.4). Afterwards, all slices were kept at room temperature until they were used for experiments, which were also performed at room temperature. Unless stated otherwise, ... @kafitz_2008

To overcome this problem, we adapted a protocol for application of the red fluorescent dye SR101, which was reported to stain astrocytes in the intact cortex of rodents ( Nimmerjahn et al., 2004 ), for use in acute slices of the rat hippocampus. SR101 is excited around 575 nm and its emission can be collected above 590 nm, making it suitable for use in combination with many available ion-selective dyes. Initial experiments were carried out employing a post-incubation with SR101-containing ACSF at room temperature for 20 min. Independent from the SR101 concentration used (from 100  M – as suggested by Nimmerjahn et al. (2004) for in vivo experiments – down to 0.5  M), this protocol resulted in an unspecific surface label of SR101. The vast majority of the unspecific SR101 staining most likely represented a nuclear label of superficial neurons whereas cells with typical astrocytic morphology were not stained (not shown). In stark contrast to this, we found that incubation of the slices right after their preparation in ACSF containing 500 nM–1  M SR101 for  20 min  at  high  temperature  (34◦C),  resulted  in  a  highly specific staining of cells with astrocytic morphology that was maintained for more than 8 h. The staining pattern of SR101 in slices obtained from animals at postnatal day 3 (P3, Fig. 1 A), P7 (not shown), P15 ( Fig. 1 B), as well as P24–27 (not shown) excluded virtually all cells of the stratum pyramidale , clearly indicating that SR101 exclusively labeled glial cells throughout development in this preparation @kafitz_2008

 FC stocks were prepared according to pub-  lished procedures (28), and acute horizontal brain slices containing the nRT  and VB were prepared following established methods (66). A subset of slices  was treated with 100  μ  M FC for at least 30 min at room temperature. For  SR101 staining, slices were incubated in 1  μ  M SR101 in oxygenated arti  fi  cial  cerebrospinal  fl  uid (ACSF) for 20 min, washed in control ACSF for at least  10 min at 34 °C, and then  fi  xed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed  for immunocytochemistry.

## Fluorocitrate



## Random

IHC was performed automated with image analysis software to exclude any bias and to be blinded. In the other cases, quantification has been validated by two independent people. Brightfield images have been acquired using a Widefield Observer (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer) slide scanner. Fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji32 and QuPath33 imaging software. For cell quantification of fluorescent images and brightfield images in which no automated quantification was possible, a minimum of eight randomly chosen regions of equal dimensions per patient and region were acquired. Total cell numbers per mm2 were calculated based on the image dimensions. For fluorescent images, z-stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells was quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. For quantification of the single-channel brightfield images and the BaseScope IHC double-positive images, the number of cells was also quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. The average of these different regions was taken and considered as n = 1. Where possible, brightfield images were quantified automatically. Therefore, whole slides were scanned using a slide scanner. Using QuPath, a minimum of four random regions per sample and condition were annotated, and cells within these regions were quantified using the automated ‘positive cell detection’ plugin.

For the quantification of the duplex BaseScope, random brightfield images were acquired in the white matter of control donors. All cells with a positive BaseScope signal were quantified and represent 100% of labelled cells; the percentages of single- or double-positive cells were determined.

For the quantification of the differences in mRNA expression between MS lesions, whole sections were scanned with a slide scanner. Demyelinated lesions were detected by the absence of IHC staining for CNP. Within these regions, between 4 and 11 random regions of equal size were annotated using QuPath and the number of BaseScope-positive dots was quantified. The average of the random regions within 1 lesioned area was considered as n = 1.

# Extracellular field potentials
The strength of synaptic communication was determined by measuring the initial slope of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSP) in an interface chamber. Borosilicate glass recording electrodes were filled with ACSF and had resistances of 1–5MV. Stimulating electrodes were placed in the stratum radi-atum of CA1 next to area CA3, and the recording electrodes were placed in the stratum radiatum of area CA1. Recording electrodes were introduced100mm into the slice. Electrical stimulationof 100–300mA for 100msec was applied using a bipolar tungsten(10-mm diameter) isonel-coated wire (A-M Systems analog stim-ulus isolator). Recordings of extracellular field potentials were amplified using an A-M Systems Neuroprobe amplifier low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (low-pass Bessel four-pole), digitized at 5 kHz, and  analyzed  using  Molecular  Devices  software  (Digidata 1322A, Clampex 8.2, and Clampfit 8.2; Molecular Devices). Stimulus intensities for recording baseline fEPSPs were adjusted to have slopes that were 50% of the maximum. Field potentials were recorded at 1-min intervals. The health of the slice was monitored by continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout experiments. Additional details of recording field potentials have been previously described (Pita-Almenar et al. 2006).   [@pita-almentar_2012]

Glass microelectrodes (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) were filled with ACSF (tip resistances 1 M Ω ) and placed in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region to record population spikes (PS). Bipolar stimulation electrodes were used to stimulate Schaffer collaterals. Extracellular recordings from the LA and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. Although we obtained similar results in in vitro experiments investigating long-term depression of activity in the LA recorded either intracellularly or extracellularly (Kaschel, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2004), it should be considered that the negative wave recorded extracellularly in the LA reflects a summation of both EPSPs and synchronized action potentials (population spike component; PS; Doyere, Schafe, Sigurdsson, & LeDoux, 2003; Watanabe, Ikegaya, Saito, & Abe, 1995). Watanabe et al. (1995) have carried out intracellular recordings of evoked potentials and confirmed that the latency of peak negative field potentials corresponds well with that of intracellularly recorded action potentials, indicating that the extracellularly recorded sharp negativity seems to be a population spike. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the amplitude of field potentials. Additionally, the slope measure in the lateral amygdala is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal, making it more difficult to analyze (Doyere et al., 2003). Thus, we also decided to record PS in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, to get a better comparison of results between these two limbic structures. Single or paired stimuli (duration 100 μ s) were presented every 10 s. Signals of the evoked responses were amplified and filtered (bandpass: 0.1 Hz to 3 KHz) by a pre-amplifier (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA), displayed on a storage oscilloscope and fed via a CED laboratory interface (Cambridge, UK) to a computer for storage.

Stimulation parameters

The input/output (I/O) response curves were constructed by varying the intensity of single-pulse stimulation (interstimulus interval: 10 s; pulse duration: 100 μ s) and averaging 6 responses for each intensity. The time interval between the consecutive increases in stimulation strength was 20 s. To evaluate short-term synaptic interactions, paired-pulse stimuli were delivered with interstimulus intervals ranging from 10 to 500 ms and averaging 6 responses for each time interval, altogether lasting 12 min. To induce LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar electrode placed on the surface of the slice and recorded population spikes (PS) in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area by theta burst stimulation (TBS) consisting of two sets of five theta bursts separated by 30 s (2 × 5 TBS) with each burst involving four pulses at 100 Hz delivered at an interval of 200 ms. The stimulus was adjusted to elicit a PS at 30% of the maximal response, which was fixed at this level throughout the experiment. In different slices of the same mouse brain, we recorded field potentials in the caudoventral part of the LA by stimulating fibers running through the external capsule. Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. Paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 900 pulses; PP-LFS) with an interstimulus interval of 40 ms was used to induce LTD. In rats we have shown that TBS of fibers located within the LA applied 20 min after the end of LFS reversed LTD, whereas HFS resulted in LTP that was stronger than that obtained in naive slices (Kaschel et al., 2004). Although such experiments were not performed until now in the CA1 region the TBS protocol seems to be suited to apply in this experiment on the basis of the laminated structure of the CA1 region. Therefore, we decided to apply HFS in the LA and TBS in the CA1 region after induction of LTD to maximize the potentiation levels and enhance the chance to detect differences between the groups. 

Data analysis

Extracellular data were collected and averaged using the custommade software Signal 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). We defined the amplitude as the absolute DC voltage of a vertical line running from the minimal point of the field potential to its intersection with a line running tangentially to the field potential onset and offset points. The significance of differences between groups ( n = number of slices) was calculated via two-wayANOVA(GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad software, San Diego, California). Significance was set at p < .05. To express and compare changes in the amplitudes of the field potentials between the animal groups, we averaged responses from the period of 59 to 60 min and 179 to 180 min, respectively, after HFS/TBS. We averaged responses to LFS from the period of 19 to 20 min. Analysis of PPF was additionally performed by means of Mann – Whitney test.

# Another one

Adult and PW male Sprague Dawley rats were anaesthetized (with 40% urethane, 5% chloral hydrate in saline; 0.5 ml/100 g, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, USA) with body temperature maintained at 37 ± 0.5C. Small holes were drilled into the skull to allow the insertion of electrodes into the brain. A bipolar 125mm stimulating electrode was inserted into the mPFC (adults: anteroposterior, 3.0 e 3.3 mm anterior to bregma; 0.7 e 1.0 mm lateral; 3.8 e 4.8 mm below the pial surface; PW: anteroposterior, 2.7 e 2.9 mm anterior to bregma; 0.5 e 0.6 mm lateral; 3.4 e 3.8 mm below the pial surface; Fig. 1 ). A single recording microelectrode (glass; tip diameter, 2 e 5mm; fi lled with 2 M NaCl; resistance,1 e 4U) was slowly lowered into the BLA (adults: anteroposterior, 3 mm posterior to bregma; lateral, 5 mm; ventral,  7.6 mm; post-weanlings: anteroposterior, 2.6 mm posterior to bregma; lateral, 4.8 e 4.9 mm; ventral,  7.4 mm; Fig.1 ). The evoked responses were digitized (10 kHz) and analyzed using a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401-plus data acquisition system (Cambridge, UK) and its Spike2 software. Of fl ine measurements were made of the amplitude of fi eld post-synaptic potentials (fPSPs) using averages of fi ve successive responses to a given stimulation intensity applied at 0.1 Hz. Test stimuli (monopolar pulses; 100ms duration) were delivered at 0.1 Hz. After positioning the electrodes, the rats were left for 30 min before commencing the experiment. 2.3. LTP induction LTP was induced using the Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) protocol, which was applied in all groups within 1.5 h of anesthesia. Theta-like high-frequency stimulation was delivered at 100 Hz (TS100) to the mPFC in three sets of 10 trains, each consisting of 10 pulses (inter-train interval, 200 ms; inter-set interval, 1 min). In all experiments baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of suf fi cient intensity (300 e 800mA) to elicit a response representing 40 e 50% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked fi eld potentials. TBS was delivered at the same intensity and pulse duration as the test stimuli during establishment of the baseline responses. Evoked field potentials at the baseline intensity were recorded from the BLA for up to 60 min following the application of TBS. The results are presented as the mean of each 5 min period to give 12 time points. LTP was de fined as an increase in the amplitude of the fPSPs. Changes in fPSP amplitude were measured for each rat as a percentage of change from its baseline.


 During experiments, individual slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber and were continuously superfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl,  25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 2 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2. The recording temperature was 25 ± 3 °C. Neurons were visualized under the guidance of infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and by their green fluorescence with epifluorescence illumination. 
 
 Measurement  of  synaptic  responses  and  LTP  induction. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs), in the presence of GABA receptor type A (GABAAR) antagonist gabazine (1 μM), were recorded from identified neurons in current or voltage clamp. Basal synaptic responses were evoked by a brief pulse (0.1–0.5  ms) of either constant voltage or current delivered by a stimulus isolation unit (Isoflex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) every 20  s with tungsten bipolar electrodes. Stimulation electrodes were positioned at axonal bundles of inputs of interest. Synaptic strength was quantified as  the peak amplitude of EPSP or EPSC. Baseline responses were collected with a stimulation intensity that  yielded 10–30% of the maximal response. Slices displaying unstable baseline recording or series resistance change of >20% were discarded. For the cortex→BLA-PN synapse, LTP was induced by pairing four  trains of HFS (HFS  × 4, 100 Hz for 1  s per train; 10  s intervals) with brief supra-threshold current step injections (approximately 2  nA; 1 ms) into the postsynaptic cell (with a 5  ms delay) in a current clamp. For the BLA→CeM neuron synapse, LTP was induced by HFS  × 4 (10 s intervals), with postsynaptic cells held at –70  mV in a current clamp54. Similarly, HFS  × 4 (20 s intervals), with postsynaptic cells held at –50 mV, was used to induce LTP at the lPB→CeL neuron synapse40.  @chiang_2015
 
 Field potential recordings Slices were transferred to an interface chamber that was continually perfused with ACSF at a rate of 1 to 2 ml/min. Microelectrodes were pulled from microfiber-filled borosilicate capillaries (OD 1.0 mm, ID 0.78 mm) using a FlamingBrown horizontal micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Extracellular recording electrodes (2–5MΩ) were filled with 3 M NaCl. The microelectrode tips were visually positioned in the basolateral region of the amygdala (between the EC and the bed nucleus of the stria terminals) under a dissecting microscope. Field potentials were amplified with a differential amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.). Output was digitized with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). On- and off-line data acquisition and analysis were carried out using WCP version 1.7b (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes were normalized to averaged baseline value (100%). The maximum rate of fEPSP within 10–90% declining phase was measuredas the slope of fEPSP using the WCP software. The recordings were made at room temperature. That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. Stimulation Synaptic responses were evokedwith sharpened tungsten bipolarstimulating electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,FL) placed in the external capsule (EC). The stimulating electrode was ~2 mm from the recording site. Stimuli were delivered using a photoelectric stimulus isolation unit with a constant cur-rent output (ISO-Flex; Stimulus Isolation Unit, Jerusalem, Israel). The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a synaptic response of less than 50% of the maximum amplitude. Single 0.1-msec monophasic square pulses were applied continuously throughout the experiment at 0.1 Hz. To induce synaptic plasticity, theta burst stimulation (TBS), trains of five pulses at 100 Hz were given at 5 Hz (the theta rhythm) for 4 s, at the same intensity through the same electrode used for test stimulation. TBS mimics the typical firing mode of hippocampal pyramidal cells during learning (Otto et al.1991). @chen_2017
 
 Glass microelectrodes(Science Products) werefilled with ACSF (tip resistance 3 MΩ)  and placed in the LA to recordfield potentials. Bipolar stimulationelectrodes were used to stimulatefibers within the LA (IN) or in theexternal capsule (EC). An input/output response curve was constructed by varying the intensity of the single-pulse stimulation and averaging six responses per intensity. The stimulus intensity that evoked afield potential with amplitude equal to 50% of themaximal response was then used for all subsequent stimulations. Once a stable baseline of responses had been obtained for at least 20 min, either HFS (two trains at 100 Hz, 1 sec duration, 30 sec apart) was delivered as to induce LTP or low frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz, 15 min) was applied to induce LTD (Müller et al. 2009). Subsequent responses to single stimuli were recorded for at least 60 min, and their amplitude quantified as a percent change with re-spect to baseline. The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP. Drug applicationAll drugs were bath-applied at the indicated concentrations starting at least 30 min before HFS or LFS. Capsaicin and AMG 9810 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience. Data analysis Extracellular data were collected and averaged using the custommade software Signal 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). We defined thefield potential amplitude as the absolute DC voltage of a verti-cal line running from the minimal point of thefield potential to itsintersection with a line running tangential to thefield potentialonset and offset points. The significance of differences betweengroups (n= number of slices) was calculated with a two-wayANOVA (GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad software). Significance was set atP< 0.05. To express and compare changes in the ampli-tudes of thefield potentials between the animal groups, we aver-aged responses from the period of 59 to 60 min after HFS or LFS.
 
 They were then submerged in a chamber (1.0 ml, 2.5 ml/min) at 30  1°C for another hour before recording. BLA fibers were stimulated with concentric electrodes (50 k  ) using 150-s pulses of varying intensity (3–15 V) at 0.05 Hz, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the capsula/medial CeA with tungsten electrodes (2–5 M  ). fEPSP magnitude was adjusted to 30% of maximum response and baseline recorded, and LTP was induced using high-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of five trains of stimuli (100 Hz for 1 s, 3-min intervals). fEPSPs were recorded at 0.05 Hz for another hour, and their slopes were normalized to baseline values. A one- or twotailed unpaired t -test or one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests were used for statistical analysis; n equals the number of slices. Methodologies for patch recording (Liu et al. 2004) and Western blot analysis (Zinebi et al. 2003) were similar to that reported previousl
 
 
 One     slice per     animal     was     investigated.     Recordings     began     approx.     2.5     h     after slice     preparation     and     LTP/LTD     induction     was     attempted     approx. 1     h     later.     Field     potentials     (FPs)     were     evoked     using     the     concentric platinum/stainless     steel     electrode     (FHC,     USA)     by     the     stimulation     (frequency:     0.05     Hz,     duration:     100     u s)     of     external     or     internal capsule     to     stimulate     cortico-amygdalar     or     thalamo-amygdalar     connections,     respectively     (reviewed     in   [24]  ).     FPs     were     recorded     using ACSF-filled     glass     micropipettes     (1–3     M ́)     placed     in     the     LA.     Signals were     amplified     (Axoprobe     2,     Axon     Instruments,     USA),     band-pass     fil-tered     (1     Hz–5     kHz),     A/D     converted     (micro1401     interface,     CED,     UK) and     analyzed     on-     and     off-line     (Signal     2     software,     CED,     UK).     Since     the initial     slope     measure     of     the     FP     in     the     LA     is     more     sensitive     to     variability     and     noise     in     the     signal   [23]  ,     we     analyzed     the     amplitude     of FPs.     After     initial     stabilization     of     the     responses,     input–output     curves were     constructed     and     then     the     stimulation     intensity     was     adjusted to     evoke     FPs     of     50%     of     the     maximum     amplitude. After     15     min     of     baseline     recording,     LTP     was     induced     by     the     theta burst     stimulation     (TBS)     protocol     consisting     of     three     trains     of     stimuli delivered     every     5     min.     Each     train     was     composed     of     six     sequences     of pulses     delivered     at     frequency     of     5     Hz   [29]  .     Each     sequence     consisted of     eight     pulses     delivered     at     100     Hz.     TBS     stimulation     pattern     was used     since     LA     projection     neurons     have     an     intrinsic     propensity     to generate     voltage-dependent     membrane     potential     oscillations     in the     theta     frequency     range   [15]   and     stimulation     of     the     LA     at     theta     frequency     induces     local     activity     that     resembles     that     occurring     during fear   [30]  . In     a     separate     set     of     experiments,     after     15     min     of     baseline     recording,     LTD     was     induced     by     low     frequency     stimulation     (LFS,     900 pulses     at     1     Hz)   [26]  .     Both     TBS     and     LFS     were     repeated     every     45     min in     order     to     reach     the     saturation     level     of     LTP     and     LTD,     respectively  [28]  .     LTP/LTD     was     considered     saturated     if     the     difference     between the     amplitudes     of     FPs     after     consecutive     TBS/LFS     delivery     was     not significant. To     examine     short-term     plasticity,     paired-pulse     stimulation     protocols     were     used.     The     stimulation     intensity     was     set     so     that     the     first stimulus     of     a     pair     evoked     a     response     that     was     50%     of     the     maximum. Paired     stimuli     were     delivered     every     20     s     to     both     inputs     to     the     LA     in an     interleaved     fashion.     Inter-stimulus     intervals     (ISIs)     of     25,     50,     100, 200,     600     and     1000     ms     were     tested     in     an     ascending     order     and     at     each interval     four     successive     FPs     were     recorded. @danielewicz_2014
 
 Slices     containing     the     lateral nucleus     of     the     amygdala     (LA)     were     transferred     to     an     interface-type recording     chamber     and     perfused     at     2     ml/min     with     a     modified     ACSF (33.5     ±     0.2◦C)     in     which     the     concentration     of     MgSO4was     lowered to     1     mM.  2.3.     Field     potential     recording  Recordings     began     approx.     2.5     h     after     slice     preparation.     Field potentials     (FPs)     were     evoked     by     stimulating     (0.05     Hz,     pulse duration:     100     u s)     the     external     or     internal     capsule     to     activate cortico-amygdalar     or     thalamo-amygdalar     connections     respectively  [20]  .     FPs     were     recorded     using     ACSF-filled     glass     micropipettes (1–3     M OhM ).     Signals     were     amplified     (Axoprobe     2,     Axon     Instruments,     USA),     band-pass     filtered     (1     Hz–5     kHz)     and     A/D     converted (micro1401     interface,     Signal     2     software,     CED,     UK).     After     measurement     of     the     relationship     between     the     stimulus     intensity     and amplitude     of     the     early,     negative-going     wave     of     FPs     (input-output curve)     stimulation     intensity     was     adjusted     to     evoke     FPs     of     50%     of maximum     response.     Next,     after     15     min     of     baseline     recording     LTP was     induced     by     theta     burst     stimulation     (TBS)     composed     of     six     trains of     pulses     delivered     at     5     Hz.     Each     train     consisted     of     eight     pulses delivered     at     100     Hz.     TBS     was     repeated     three     times     every     5     min.     To reach     the     saturation     level     of     LTP,     TBS     sequences     were     repeated     4 and     5     times     at     the     thalamic     and     the     cortical     input     to     the     LA,     respectively,     every     45     minutes   [17]  .     LTD     was     induced     by     low     frequency stimulation     (LFS,     900     pulses     at     1     Hz).     In     both     inputs     LFS     sequences were     delivered     5     times     to     saturate     LTD.  
 
   Data     analysis  Statistical     analyses     were     performed     using     the     SigmaPlot     11.0 software     (Systat     Software,     Inc.).     The     mean     amplitude     of     responses recorded     after     the     last     conditioning     stimulation     was     compared to     the     initial     baseline     values     and     expressed     as     a     percentage     of change.     Group     comparisons     employed     two-way     analysis     of     variance     (ANOVA)     with     the     type     of     treatment     (MS     or     control)     as     the first     factor     and     the     drug     administered     (imipramine     or     saline)     as     the second     factor.     Two-way     ANOVA     was     followed     by     the     Tukey’s     posthoc     test     and     p     <     0.05     was     taken     as     significant.     Data     are     presented     as group     means     ±     SEM. Stimulus-response     plots     were     fitted     with     the     Boltzmann     equation:     Vi=     Vmax/(1     +     exp     ((u-uh)/-S)).     The     following     parameters     were compared:     the     maximum     field     potential     amplitude     (Vmax),     the stimulation     intensity     evoking     a     field     potential     of     half-maximum amplitude     (uh)     and     the     factor     proportional     to     the     slope     of     the     curve (S).  @danielewicz_2017
