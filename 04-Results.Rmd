Considering presented above immunohistochemical findings that CX3CL1 shown higher expression of CX3CL1 in the BLA under basal conditions, it might modulate neuronal activity and excitability in this area. 
To test this hypothesis, it was investigated whether CX3CL1 could directly affect the excitability of principal cells, the most numerous neurons in the BLA, using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique, in a current-clamp configuration.<!--Given that principal cells' excitability has been consistently reported to influence not only activity within the BLA complex, but also in the CeA, and within ITCs clusters (see Section \@ref(BLAstructure)), this study investigated whether CX3CL1 may regulate excitability of those cells. First, I was interested in determining whether CX3CL1 affect any membrane properties of principal neurons in the BLA. Considering their efferents , the regulation of firing in those neurons is thought to have critical impact not only on other pyramidal cells within the BLA complex, but also on ITCs clusters and the CeA complex.// As these neurons receive many inputs from broad array of structures *in vivo*, together with their // -->

Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed that principal cells fired significantly less after CX3CL1 application (group × current steps intensity interaction: F(1.973,53.279)=19.648, P<0.001, Greenhouse–Geisser correction) (Figure 4d). 
Further analysis revealed that while the gain remained unchanged (baseline = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(gain)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(gain), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 3)`, CX3CL1(2nM) = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(gain)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(gain), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 3)`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityappendixfigure) in the Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1membraneappendix)), <!--figure Appendix-->
the action potential threshold was significantly depolarized, compared to baseline (from `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)` to `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)` mV, n = `r BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)') %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(Cell) %>% n_distinct()`, N = `r BLA_df_final %>% dplyr::filter(Experiment == 'CX3CL1(2nM)') %>% group_by(Filename_all1) %>% mutate(animals = str_sub(Filename_all1, start = 1, end = 5)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(animals) %>% n_distinct()`, `r CX3CL1_2nM_BLA_stat_tres`, see Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)<!--WHICH PARTS-->).

MIXED / REPEATED MEASURE ANOVA AND INTERACTION? -->
To validate whether CX3CL1-induced reduction in the excitability is dependent on CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, the two approaches were used. 
First, before recordings, a subset of slices was incubated with antibody against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml). <!--jakieć cytowanie które też tak robiło? + dawka?-->
It was found that after incubation with CX3CR1 antibody the CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells' excitability was not statistically significant, however there still was a subset of neurons which reacted with depolarized action potential threshold (Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)<!--which parts?-->).
Notably, slices used in this study were 300 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thin, and the penetration of antibody was limited and estimated as `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")` 50 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m under our experimental conditions, as was revealed by analysis of post-recording immunostaining on a subset of slices.<!--albo see i odwołanie do rysunku albo cytowanie Fogarty MJ, Hammond LA, Kanjhan R, Bellingham MC, Noakes PG.

To this end, another subset of experiments were perfomed using pharmacological approach with selected AZD8797 to inhibit CX3CR1.<!-- by antagonist.// For this reason, we selected AZD8797  to  inhibit  CX3CR1  for  investigating  its pharmacological  role  towards  inflammation  during hypertension.  // For this reason, this observation was additionally confirmed using pharmacological inhibition of CX3CR1 receptor, a selective antagonist (AZD8797).--><!-- NIE WIEM CZY TO PISAĆ...Moreover, since 10 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M AZD8797 was previously reported to efficiently prevented CX3CL1-induced outcomes, along with its elimination of the observed effect on PCs' excitability, I decided to use this concentration experiments presented in this dissertation.--><!--We decided to use, in all future experiments, 100 nM of CXCL16 since, at this concentration, neuronal cell death was efficiently prevented ...At all the tested concentrations, CXCL16 per se was not toxic (data not shown). --><!-- w tym artykule odwołują się na [] czyli badania gdzie antagonista jest nazwany 18a też są spoko!!!! @karlstrm_2013--><!-- The in vivo IC  50  was  estimated at 2  μ  M (range, 1.5  –  4  μ  M).@ridderstadwollberg_2014  -->
As shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak), AZD8797 prevented the CX3CL1-induced decrease in principal cells' excitability, manifested as more depolarized action potential threshold, and thereby additionally confirmed CX3CR1 mediation in the observed effect (`r CX3CL1_azdfrak2nM_BLA_stat_tres`, n = `r BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)') %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(Cell) %>% n_distinct()`, N = `r BLA_df_final %>% dplyr::filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)') %>% group_by(Filename_all1) %>% mutate(animals = str_sub(Filename_all1, start = 1, end = 5)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(animals) %>% n_distinct()`).
<!-- dodatkowa analiza porównująca ANTIBODY AND AZD + CX3CL1 czy napisanie o różnicy w proporcji odpowiadających komórek? -->
Of note, AZD9787 did not affect this parameter when applied alone (\@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd), baseline in DMSO = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)`, AZD8797(10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M) = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797' & Condition == "AZD8797") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797' & Condition == "AZD8797") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)` mV, n = `r BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797') %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(Cell) %>% n_distinct()`, N = `r BLA_df_final %>% dplyr::filter(Experiment == 'AZD8797') %>% group_by(Filename_all1) %>% mutate(animals = str_sub(Filename_all1, start = 1, end = 5)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(animals) %>% n_distinct()`, `r CX3CL1_azda_BLA_stat_tres`)). 

Since it is well-known that the CX3CR1 receptor is mostly expressed on microglia, the possible involvement of this type of glial cells in mediating CX3CL1-induced reduction of PCs excitability was investigated.<!-- citations--><!--wcześniej : the protocol to pharmacologically inhibit microglial cells using minocycline on acute brain slices were adapted from other studies. // Since we found that CXCR6 is functionally expressed on microglia (see Fig. 2), we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of microglia in mediating CXCL16-induced neuroprotective effect. For this reason we pretreated hippocampal neuronal cultures with minocycline, a tetracycline-like antibiotic known to inhibit microglia activation, before Glu insult.
-->
For this reason, the slices were pretreated with 100`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M minocycline, a tetracycline-like antibiotic known to inhibit microglia activation, before and during CX3CL1 application.
As presented in Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak), the inhibition of microglial activity also diminished the CX3CL1-induced effect on the action potential threshold (`r CX3CL1_minofrak2nM_BLA_stat_tres`).
In contrast, the minocycline applied alone increased the excitability of PCs (baseline = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'minocycline' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'minocycline' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)`, minocycline (100`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M) = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'minocycline' & Condition == "minocycline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'minocycline' & Condition == "minocycline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)` mV, n = `r BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'minocycline') %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(Cell) %>% n_distinct()`, N = `r BLA_df_final %>% dplyr::filter(Experiment == 'minocycline') %>% group_by(Filename_all1) %>% mutate(animals = str_sub(Filename_all1, start = 1, end = 5)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(animals) %>% n_distinct()`, `r CX3CL1_minoa_BLA_stat_tres`, \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd)). 
Thus, this finding highlights the potential importance of microglial functions in regulating the activity of neurons in the BLA. 

Finally, since the activity of principal cells in the BLA is well-known to be tightly controlled by heterogeneous group of interneurons, it was investigated whether blocking GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptors would eliminate the effect of CX3CL1.<!-- ZMIENIĆ!!!!!!!!! I DODAĆ JACY ANTAGONIŚCI!!!!!!!!! dawki Treatment with both GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ antagonists (picrotoxin, 100 ... and ) ... fully abolished the neuronal response to CX3CL1.--> 
As expected, the CX3CL1 effect was fully abolished when the GABAergic receptors were blocked (baseline = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "baseline") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)`, CX3CL1 (2nM) = `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(Treshold1_all)), digits = 2)` `r knitr::asis_output("\U00B1")` `r round(BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)' & Condition == "CX3CL1") %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::summarize(x = sd(Treshold1_all), count = n()) %>% dplyr::summarize(x/sqrt(count)), digits = 2)` mV, n = `r BLA_df_final %>% filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)') %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(Cell) %>% n_distinct()`, N = `r BLA_df_final %>% dplyr::filter(Experiment == 'picrotoxin + \nCGP52432 + \nCX3CL1(2nM)') %>% group_by(Filename_all1) %>% mutate(animals = str_sub(Filename_all1, start = 1, end = 5)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::select(animals) %>% n_distinct()`, `r CX3CL1_gabafrak2nM_BLA_stat_tres`, Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)).
Thus, these data suggest that CX3CL1 reduces principal cells' activity *via* CX3CR1-, microglia-, and interneuron-dependent manner.

As the results presented above indicated that CX3CL1 effect is mediated by GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptors, the possible influence of CX3CL1 on the inhibitory transmission onto BLA PCs was next explored in *in vitro* slices.<!-- Next, We next explored the possible influence of harmine on the GABAergic transmission onto BA PNs. -->
Cells were clamped at 0 mV to record the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs).<!-- Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded *via* whole-cell patch clamp recordings (held at −70 mV).  -->
The representative traces of sIPSCs in the absence (referred to as baseline hereafter) or presence of CX3CL1 (2 and 5nM) (referred to as CX3CL1) are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC).<!-- The effect of harmine on sIPSCs was shown in supplemental, Fig. S2.--> 
While the dose 2nM did not elicit 
Compared to the control, CX3CL1 markedly reduced the median frequency and amplitude of GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA (from ... to... Hz and from .... to ...., respectively).

<!-- nie wiem czy o tym pisać, pewnie by wypadało...
In parallel with this, the cumulative probability curve of sIPSC amplitude was considerably right-shifted (p = 0.0028, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test,supplemental, Fig. S2D). 
The cumulative probability curve of interevent interval, on the other hand, was left-shifted upon harmine treatment (p < 0.0001, Kolmogorov– Smirnov test, supplemental, Fig.S2E).  zmienić -->

Further analysis of the IPSC kinetic parameters showed that the median rise times and decay times of the sIPSCs <!--and mIPSCs--> remained unchanged (baseline: , CX3CL1(5nM): and baseline: , CX3CL1(5nM):, respectively). <!-- może lepiej % + SEM? --> 

To determine if the decrease in sIPSC frequency by CX3CL1 was due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, the TTX (500nM) was used to block neuronal firing and the mIPSC amplitude, frequency, and kinetics was measured before and after CX3CL1 application (also clamped at 0 mV).<!-- Alternatively: To determine whether there was a direct effect of CX3CL1 on GABAergic terminals, miniature mIPSC (mIPSCs) were recorded from principal cells. In these experiments TTX was used to block the action potentials. --> 

#### Complex effects of CX3CL1 on excitatory synaptic transmission

In contrast to inhibitory synaptic transmission, compared to baseline, CX3CL1 had negligible effect on the mean value of sEPSC amplitude and frequency, which was further described in the Appendix (see: \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)). <!-- może dodać o tendency i zrobić jednak nowy podrozdział?-->
<!-- podsumowanie o synaptic transmission and excitability..., bo następne zdanie to adress these issues-->
<!-- Our findings overall highlight microglia and its receptor CX3CR1 as key contributors in regulation of social behavioral adaptation to chronic stress.-->

#### CX3CL1 impairs the long-term potentiation in the BLA

To address these issues and gain insights into how CX3CL1 modulate network activity, the extracellular recordings were employed and the amplitude of field potentials, short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation were assessed.<!-- paired pulse ratio-->

Comparing control and CX3CL1-applied slices, no significant effect on basal excitability, as assessed by input – output curves, was found despite a trend   toward   increased   excitability. <!-- moja statystyka do zrobienia... (Supplementary Figure  S7;  F(1,16) = 2.280, P = 0.151)-->

The paired-pulse ratio remained unaffected. 

However, upon application of TBS<!--Theta Burst Stimulation-->, external capsule-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control slices, but not in the slices treated with CX3CL1, as revealed by a significant decreased measured by the comparison of average potentiation across time points after induction <!-- moja statystyka do zrobienia... albo Bartkowa...(Figure 4g, t (16) = 4.03, P = 0.001)-->.<!-- poprawić mixed model repeated-measure ANOVA (group effect: (F (1,16) = 16.27, P = 0.001; and group × post-HFS time point interaction: F(2.071,33.136) = 9.231, P = 0.001, Greenhouse – Geisser correction; Figure 4f)// The comparison of average potentiation across time points after induction also revealed a highly significant difference between these two groups of slices (Figure 4g, t (16) = 4.03, P = 0.001).// Upon application of HFS, vSub-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control group, but not in the NF knockdown group as revealed by mixed model  repeated-measure  ANOVA  (group  effect:  (F (1,16) = 16.27, P = 0.001; and group × post-HFS time point interaction: F(2.071,33.136) = 9.231, P = 0.001, Greenhouse – Geisser correction; Figure 4f).-->

#### CX3CL1 .... dendritic spines

Nevertheless, considering overall data, we  can speculate that on microglial cells the activation of  CX  3  CR1 triggers the release of adenosine that in turn, *via*  A  2A  R activity, increases the release of D-serine from glia  leading to a potentiation of NMDA function <!-- analogous-->

Together, these findings illustrate not only the increasing evidence for a role for BLA glutamatergic inputs to the NA in regulating reinforcement and reward but also that, depending on the part of the NA targeted, other glutamatergic inputs do not necessarily produce identical results <!-- analogous-->

Accompanying this delay in maturation of spine density was a defect in functional maturation of hippocampal synapses as measured by the ratio of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude (sEPSC/mEPSC amplitude ratio), long-term depression induction, and seizure susceptibil- ity.

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in the CeA

The basolateral and central complexes of the amygdala participate in different extended circuitries <!--citations--> and hence, the CX3CL1 may differentially regulate these networks. 
To gain insight into the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the CeA circuitry, we examined the functional characteristic of the IPSCs in DG granule cells (Figure 1) and CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2) in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. <!-- zmienić oczywiście...// they have different connectivity patterns -->


### Cellular distribution of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the rat CeA

Coupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. <!-- ...-->

Finally, it should be noted that 

### Cellular distribution of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in the rat BLA

To explore how CXCL12 affects local communication between neurons and glia in the BLA, immunohistochemical double staining for CXCR4 in this area was performed with <!--nestin, DCX, NeuN, CD34, fetal liver kinase (Flk)-1, and CD31-->. 


### CXCL12/CXCR4 modulation of the electrical properties in BLA neurons 

Depletion of astroglia in both BLA and CeA was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining using GFAP antibody in a subset of f...-incubated slices.

## CXCL12/CXCR4 in the CeA

These effects of SDF-1 were mediated *via* CXCR4 as they were abrogated by administration of a selective CXCR4 antagonist.

### CXCL12/CXCR4 modulation of the electrical properties in CeA neurons

AMD3100 eliminates the beneficial effects of CXCL12, indicating that the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway is vitally important in improving the neurobehavioral outcomes of ischemic mice, so studies were performed to detect the expression of CXCR4.

To address this question, it was first determined the properties of ...

On the basis of our results, we conclude that

our finding of  …, …, …, support the hypothesis that 

More generally, our data significantly extend the understanding of glial functions  by showing that microglia are actively regulating inhibitory synapses

To investigate the effect of AZD8797 on chronic proinflammatory environment in the NTS, we analyzed the levels

###### electrophysiology

Around 75% of BLA neurons showed responsiveness to MCP-1/CCL2. 
The effect was not inhibited when GTP was omitted from the patch pipette medium (Fig. 8b, right).

The representative traces of sEPSCs in the absence (referred to as control hereafter) or presence of harmine (10μM) (referred to as harmine) were shown in supplemental Fig. S1(A)

To elucidate how IFNg affects nociceptive responses in the spinal dorsal horn, we analyzed the effects of IFNg on postsynaptic action by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SG neurons.

To determine the nature of local connections between neurons in the CeL, paired whole-cell recordings were made in acute coronal slices of wild-type mice (Fig. - Hunt2017

To investigate the effect of <!--minocycline on inhibitory transmission-->, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from SG neurons were made under control conditions and after bath application of minocycline (100 lM)

Taken together, our findings indicate that minocycline increases the frequency of sIPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 of 85 lM) without changing their amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism that contributes to the effect of minocycline

2.1-fold 2 r 4 in the spontaneous postsynaptic currents was elicited by GRO a 50 nM even in the presence of TTX 3 m M indicating that the action of the chemokine was exerted on neurotransmitter release mechanisms rather than on nerve cell excitability

To further examine whether neuronal activity contributes to the increase in sIPSC frequency produced by minocycline, we next tested whether TTX affected the response of minocycline. 

Therefore, we hypothesized that intrathecal administration of CCL2 would enhance spinal nociceptive transmission and cause thermal hyperalgesia by activating the spinal microglia. 
This hypothesis was tested using intrathecal administration of minocycline, a specific inhibitor of microglial activation [38,39]. 
Previous studies [40,41] showed that an intrathecal injection of minocycline (100 μg) blocked microglial activation.

AMPA-mediated spontaneous and mEPSC frequency is increased in EAE without change in the probability of release 
To determine whether the change in frequency between CFA and EAE was caused by alteration of unitary synaptic properties, we recorded mEPSCs after bath applying the sodium channel blocker, TTX. 

The amplitudes of mEPSCs reflect the number and conductance of subsynaptic AMPARs, whereas the frequency reflects the probability of vesicle release (p) and/or the number of synapses (Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008).

We found that mEPSC frequency was significantly increased (....) without any change in mEPSC amplitude.

The results suggest that IFNg enhances NMDA receptor signaling by activating IFNg receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 
Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, inhibited the IFNg-induced facilitation of NMDA current, but inhibition of the neuronal JAK- STAT signaling did not. 
Therefore, we conclude that IFNg binds its own receptors in microglia but not SG neurons, and the subsequent microglial activation leads to NMDA receptor activation. - Sonekatsu2016

In a subset of experiments, slices were incubated in ACSF supplemented with  hyperpolarization-activated cation-nonselective (HCN) channels selective antagonists, ZD7288 (10 $\upmu$M) to verify whether the action of lamotrigine was HCN-dependent.

####### electro conclusion

These  studies indicate   the   direct   relationship   between   stress   and   GABA modulation in the amygdala.

####### silent synapses

An increased number of synapses could result from more dendritic spines and/or unsilencing of silent synapses.
In a silent synapse, an EPSC is absent because of a postsynaptic complement exclusively of NMDA receptors; hence, in the absence of depolarization, it cannot conduct current in response to presynaptic glutamate release. 
In response to sufficient depolarization, AMPARs can be inserted in the postsynaptic density, thereby making the synapse active or “unsilenced.” 
To this end, we measured the maximum amplitude of the eEPSC at -70 mV (AMPAR-mediated) and then at 40 mV, at a 50 ms latency (NMDA-mediated), both in the presence of picrotoxin (Fig. 2A).

significantly inhibited the amplitude of electrically evoked GABAergic IPSCs elicited from both the LPC and local synapses (Figure 3a). 

The inhibition of GABAergic transmission by 10mM PD128907 did not recover during an extensive washout period.
Despite this, the pipette resistance did not significantly change during the duration of these recordings.

Since microglia is an upstream partner of astrocytes in response to stimuli (Pascual et al., 2012), we next examined whether astrocyte activation will affect sIPSCs - Peng


The above observations suggest that minocycline may decrease neuronal excitability in a concentration- and cell-type-dependent manner by decreasing glutamatergic transmission.

Do these synaptic changes affect neuronal firing?

To understand the intracellular activity during SWs (SWi), simultaneous whole-cell recordings were obtained from BLA neurons. 

To gain insight into the inhibitory regulation of the local hippocampal circuitry, we examined the functional characteristic of the IPSCs in DG granule cells (Figure 1) and CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2) in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.

Comparison of neurochemical GABAergic synapse labeling between cell types showed that BLA interneurons receive a significantly higher density of putative GABAergic synapses compared with principal cells (Figs. 7 and 8).

This was also accompanied by significant increases in the frequency of sIPSCs (Fig. 9 and Table 3) compared with principal cells.



Of these cells, nine were classed as type 1 and the other nine as type 2

Quantitative analysis of GABAergic synapse markers and measurement of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in BLA projection neurons after neurofascin knockdown ex vivo confirmed the loss of GABAergic input.

We were next interested in determining if lamotrigine affects GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, a brain area critically involved in the coordination of neuronal activity that gives rise to network oscillations by GABAergic interneurons. 

###### immuno


###### dendrites

To analyze <!--the afferent connectivity of fully mature newborn granule neurons-->, we examined the dendritic spines of <!--8-weekold RFP+ cells -->.
These spines can be classified into various typologies on the basis of morphological criteria (Pallas-Bazarra et al., 2016; Pallas-Bazarra et al., 2017). <!--dać publikacje zespołu Jakuba-->

Fig. 4A and B shows representative images of dendritic fragments of <!--newborn neurons of WT (A) and CX3CR1?/? (B) animals -->. 
In addition, the classification of dendritic spines into mushroom, thin and stubby types is illustrated. 
Neurons <!--of CX3CR1?/? mice--> showed a reduction in the total number of dendritic spines.
To further characterize the populations of spines present in these cells, we measured the percentage of each type of spine (D).
As shown, the percentage of stubby spines was increased in CX3CR1?/? animals, whereas that of mushroom spines was reduced. 
Thus, these data show that the absence of CX3CR1 leads to a decrease in the number of newborn granule neuron dendritic spines and alterations in their morphology (namely, an enlargement and shortening).

To confirm whether dendritic spine density was increased,

In addition, we also examined spine morphology because changes in spine morphology are believed to represent one mechanism by which synaptic activity leaves its imprint on neurons. This was concurrent with an increase in spines with well-defined heads, which is correlated with spine maturation.


###### CeL clustering

We first performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on cells and then made post hoc morphological reconstructions of the recorded cells. 

Because the onset of spikes varied in response to different current injections, we determined the spike delay ( Fig. 1 D ) of the first AP upon a just suprathreshold current (i.e., rheobase) injection. 
Moreover, we determined the first AP properties, including the peak amplitude, voltage threshold, half-width, maximal rising rate, and maximal falling rate (see Materials and Methods). 
In addition to AP phenotypes, ES and LS cells differed in their subthreshold membrane responses ( Fig. 1 D ).
In striking contrast to ES cells, LS cells exhibited a slow ascending ramp in response to subthreshold current injection and displayed a greater ramp ratio ( Table 1 ).

To further test whether ES and LS cells arise from two separate classes of CeL neurons or if they represent a single population of cells spanning a continuum of excitability, we analyzed several other physiological features ( Table 1 ) from all non-LTB neurons. 
Overall, four features (spike delay, ramp ratio, RMP, and rheobase) showed non-Gaussian distributions ( Fig. 1 E ). 
To divide these two distinct cell classes unbiasedly, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis from 90 randomly recorded CeL neurons based on these four features ( Cossart et al., 2006 ; Graves et al., 2012 ; also see Materials and Methods). Strikingly, the cluster dendrogram yielded two distinct neuron populations, LS and ES cells ( Fig. 1 F ). The spike delay of LS and ES neurons was 1776 21 ms (blue, n 	 50) and 834 88 ms (red, n 	 40), respectively ( p 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Table 1 ). In addition, the LS population exhibited a more hyperpolarized RMP and a larger rheobase ( Table 1 ). Similar to the dendrogram, the scatter-plot of spike delay versus ramp ratio revealed two distinctly nonoverlapping clusters ( Fig. 1 G ). Classification of cells with the arbitrary cutoff value (spike delay of 1.5 s) fell into two categories, which corresponded to the same two populations determined by the unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis. As a result, we classified neurons with a spike delay of 
 1.5 s at rheobase as the LS cells and the remainders as the ES cells in the subsequent experiments of this study.
 
Based on literature, we included following criteria: (1) adaptation ratio [@hunt_2017], (2) rheobase and RMS [@hou_2016], 


###### LTP BLA

Upon application of HFS, vSub-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control group, but not in the NF knockdown group as revealed by mixed model repeated-measure ANOVA (group effect: (F (1,16) = 16.27, P = 0.001; and group × post-HFS time point interaction: F(2.071,33.136) = 9.231, P = 0.001, Greenhouse – Geisser correction; Figure 4f). The comparison of average potentiation across time points after induction also revealed a highly significant difference between the two groups (Figure 4g, t (16) = 4.03, P = 0.001).

NF knockdown with the less effective NF1196 vector also reduced vSub-BLA LTP (Supplementary Figure S8b and c) without altering the input – output curve (Supplementary Figure S8a). Together, this demonstrates a specific impairment of BLA synaptic plasticity to vSub inputs after NF knockdown.

The effect of **500 pM CX3CL1** on LTP in the DG was investigated both in the presence and absence of 100 μM of the GABAA receptor/chloride channel inhibitor, picrotoxin (Sigma–Aldrich).-Sheridan2014

<!-- We decided to use, in all future experiments, 100 nM of CXCL16 since, at this concentration, neuronal cell death was efficiently prevented 
At all the tested concentrations, CXCL16 per se was not toxic (data not shown). 
Hyaluronidase does not significantly affect neuronal 0electrophysiological properties when applied solely,

 We chose a dose that does not activate basal HPA axis activity
 
 The dorsal and ventral parts of the local hippocampal neuronal networks participate in different extended circuitries (Papatheodoropoulos, 2018; Strange et al., 2014) and hence, the inhibitory input of the intrinsic primary hippocampal circuitry may vary and differentially regulate the local network. To gain insight into the inhibitory regulation of the local hippocampal circuitry, we examined the functional characteristic of the IPSCs in DG granule cells (Figure 1) and CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2) in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.
