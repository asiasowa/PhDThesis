## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in the BLA

We performed immunohistochemistry on CXCR7-EGFP transgenic mice to further characterize the types of cells expressing CXCR7 in adult mouse brain. 
Using cell type specific markers, CXCR7 expression was mainly found in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells.

###### electrophysiology

Around 75% of BLA neurons showed responsiveness to MCP-1/CCL2. 
The effect was not inhibited when GTP was omitted from the patch pipette medium (Fig. 8b, right).

The representative traces of sEPSCs in the absence (referred to as control hereafter) or presence of harmine (10μM) (referred to as harmine) were shown in supplemental Fig. S1(A)

To elucidate how IFNg affects nociceptive responses in the spinal dorsal horn, we analyzed the effects of IFNg on postsynaptic action by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SG neurons.

To determine the nature of local connections between neurons in the CeL, paired whole-cell recordings were made in acute coronal slices of wild-type mice (Fig. - Hunt2017

To investigate the effect of <!--minocycline on inhibitory transmission-->, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from SG neurons were made under control conditions and after bath application of minocycline (100 lM)

Taken together, our findings indicate that minocycline increases the frequency of sIPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 of 85 lM) without changing their amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism that contributes to the effect of minocycline

2.1-fold 2 r 4 in the spontaneous postsynaptic currents was elicited by GRO a 50 nM even in the presence of TTX 3 m M indicating that the action of the chemokine was exerted on neurotransmitter release mechanisms rather than on nerve cell excitability

To further examine whether neuronal activity contributes to the increase in sIPSC frequency produced by minocycline, we next tested whether TTX affected the response of minocycline. 

Therefore, we hypothesized that intrathecal administration of CCL2 would enhance spinal nociceptive transmission and cause thermal hyperalgesia by activating the spinal microglia. 
This hypothesis was tested using intrathecal administration of minocycline, a specific inhibitor of microglial activation [38,39]. 
Previous studies [40,41] showed that an intrathecal injection of minocycline (100 μg) blocked microglial activation.

AMPA-mediated spontaneous and mEPSC frequency is increased in EAE without change in the probability of release 
To determine whether the change in frequency between CFA and EAE was caused by alteration of unitary synaptic properties, we recorded mEPSCs after bath applying the sodium channel blocker, TTX. 

The amplitudes of mEPSCs reflect the number and conductance of subsynaptic AMPARs, whereas the frequency reflects the probability of vesicle release (p) and/or the number of synapses (Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008).

We found that mEPSC frequency was significantly increased (....) without any change in mEPSC amplitude.

The results suggest that IFNg enhances NMDA receptor signaling by activating IFNg receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 
Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, inhibited the IFNg-induced facilitation of NMDA current, but inhibition of the neuronal JAK- STAT signaling did not. 
Therefore, we conclude that IFNg binds its own receptors in microglia but not SG neurons, and the subsequent microglial activation leads to NMDA receptor activation. - Sonekatsu2016

####### silent synapses

An increased number of synapses could result from more dendritic spines and/or unsilencing of silent synapses.
In a silent synapse, an EPSC is absent because of a postsynaptic complement exclusively of NMDA receptors; hence, in the absence of depolarization, it cannot conduct current in response to presynaptic glutamate release. 
In response to sufficient depolarization, AMPARs can be inserted in the postsynaptic density, thereby making the synapse active or “unsilenced.” 
To this end, we measured the maximum amplitude of the eEPSC at -70 mV (AMPAR-mediated) and then at 40 mV, at a 50 ms latency (NMDA-mediated), both in the presence of picrotoxin (Fig. 2A).

significantly inhibited the amplitude of electrically evoked GABAergic IPSCs elicited from both the LPC and local synapses (Figure 3a). 

The inhibition of GABAergic transmission by 10mM PD128907 did not recover during an extensive washout period.
Despite this, the pipette resistance did not significantly change during the duration of these recordings.

Since microglia is an upstream partner of astrocytes in response to stimuli (Pascual et al., 2012), we next examined whether astrocyte activation will affect sIPSCs - Peng


The above observations suggest that minocycline may decrease neuronal excitability in a concentration- and cell-type-dependent manner by decreasing glutamatergic transmission.

Do these synaptic changes affect neuronal firing?

To understand the intracellular activity during SWs (SWi), simultaneous whole-cell recordings were obtained from BLA neurons. 

To gain insight into the inhibitory regulation of the local hippocampal circuitry, we examined the functional characteristic of the IPSCs in DG granule cells (Figure 1) and CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2) in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.

Comparison of neurochemical GABAergic synapse labeling between cell types showed that BLA interneurons receive a significantly higher density of putative GABAergic synapses compared with principal cells (Figs. 7 and 8).

This was also accompanied by significant increases in the frequency of sIPSCs (Fig. 9 and Table 3) compared with principal cells.

Although our neurochemical immunolabeling is limited by antibody penetration (Fogarty et al. 2013)<!--@klenowski_2015-->, and is therefore confined to subsampling of cell bodies and neuronal arbors that lie within 32um of the surface of the slice, we found an association between sIPSC frequency and neurochemical

Of these cells, nine were classed as type 1 and the other nine as type 2

Quantitative analysis of GABAergic synapse markers and measurement of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in BLA projection neurons after neurofascin knockdown ex vivo confirmed the loss of GABAergic input.

###### dendrites

To analyze <!--the afferent connectivity of fully mature newborn granule neurons-->, we examined the dendritic spines of <!--8-weekold RFP+ cells -->.
These spines can be classified into various typologies on the basis of morphological criteria (Pallas-Bazarra et al., 2016; Pallas-Bazarra et al., 2017). <!--dać publikacje zespołu Jakuba-->

Fig. 4A and B shows representative images of dendritic fragments of <!--newborn neurons of WT (A) and CX3CR1?/? (B) animals -->. 
In addition, the classification of dendritic spines into mushroom, thin and stubby types is illustrated. 
Neurons <!--of CX3CR1?/? mice--> showed a reduction in the total number of dendritic spines.
To further characterize the populations of spines present in these cells, we measured the percentage of each type of spine (D).
As shown, the percentage of stubby spines was increased in CX3CR1?/? animals, whereas that of mushroom spines was reduced. 
Thus, these data show that the absence of CX3CR1 leads to a decrease in the number of newborn granule neuron dendritic spines and alterations in their morphology (namely, an enlargement and shortening).

To confirm whether dendritic spine density was increased,

In addition, we also examined spine morphology because changes in spine morphology are believed to represent one mechanism by which synaptic activity leaves its imprint on neurons. This was concurrent with an increase in spines with well-defined heads, which is correlated with spine maturation.


###### CeL clustering

We first performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on cells and then made post hoc morphological reconstructions of the recorded cells. 

Because the onset of spikes varied in response to different current injections, we determined the spike delay ( Fig. 1 D ) of the first AP upon a just suprathreshold current (i.e., rheobase) injection. 
Moreover, we determined the first AP properties, including the peak amplitude, voltage threshold, half-width, maximal rising rate, and maximal falling rate (see Materials and Methods). 
In addition to AP phenotypes, ES and LS cells differed in their subthreshold membrane responses ( Fig. 1 D ).
In striking contrast to ES cells, LS cells exhibited a slow ascending ramp in response to subthreshold current injection and displayed a greater ramp ratio ( Table 1 ).

To further test whether ES and LS cells arise from two separate classes of CeL neurons or if they represent a single population of cells spanning a continuum of excitability, we analyzed several other physiological features ( Table 1 ) from all non-LTB neurons. 
Overall, four features (spike delay, ramp ratio, RMP, and rheobase) showed non-Gaussian distributions ( Fig. 1 E ). 
To divide these two distinct cell classes unbiasedly, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis from 90 randomly recorded CeL neurons based on these four features ( Cossart et al., 2006 ; Graves et al., 2012 ; also see Materials and Methods). Strikingly, the cluster dendrogram yielded two distinct neuron populations, LS and ES cells ( Fig. 1 F ). The spike delay of LS and ES neurons was 1776 21 ms (blue, n 	 50) and 834 88 ms (red, n 	 40), respectively ( p 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Table 1 ). In addition, the LS population exhibited a more hyperpolarized RMP and a larger rheobase ( Table 1 ). Similar to the dendrogram, the scatter-plot of spike delay versus ramp ratio revealed two distinctly nonoverlapping clusters ( Fig. 1 G ). Classification of cells with the arbitrary cutoff value (spike delay of 1.5 s) fell into two categories, which corresponded to the same two populations determined by the unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis. As a result, we classified neurons with a spike delay of 
 1.5 s at rheobase as the LS cells and the remainders as the ES cells in the subsequent experiments of this study.
 
Based on literature, we included following criteria: (1) adaptation ratio [@hunt_2017], (2) rheobase and RMS [@hou_2016], 


###### LTP BLA

To address the functional physiological consequences of NF knockdown, we turned to extracellular recordings, and examined properties of vSub-evoked field potentials in the BLA in animals with confirmed viral expression and recording sites (Supplementary Figure S6). Comparing NF1707 ( n = 10) and CTR ( n = 8) groups, no significant effect on basal excitability, as assessed by input – output curves, was found despite a trend toward increased excitability (Supplementary Figure S7; F(1,16) = 2.280, P = 0.151). Repeated-measure ANOVA showed no group × intensity interaction (F (2.080,33.27) = 1.984, P = 0.152, Greenhouse – Geisser correction).

Upon application of HFS, vSub-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control group, but not in the NF knockdown group as revealed by mixed model repeated-measure ANOVA (group effect: (F (1,16) = 16.27, P = 0.001; and group × post-HFS time point interaction: F(2.071,33.136) = 9.231, P = 0.001, Greenhouse – Geisser correction; Figure 4f). The comparison of average potentiation across time points after induction also revealed a highly significant difference between the two groups (Figure 4g, t (16) = 4.03, P = 0.001).

NF knockdown with the less effective NF1196 vector also reduced vSub-BLA LTP (Supplementary Figure S8b and c) without altering the input – output curve (Supplementary Figure S8a). Together, this demonstrates a specific impairment of BLA synaptic plasticity to vSub inputs after NF knockdown.
