# Discussion

Chemokines are a class of small immune proteins emerging as neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication.
Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are particularly important in this regard, as they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they were shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, as well as the behavioral level [@sowa_2021; @trettel_2020].
Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors [@schubert_2018; @yang_2016].
As their receptors, CXCR4 and CX3CR1, are relatively densely present in the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a; @harrison_1998; @stumm_2002; @stumm_2003; @tarozzo_2003], the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders [@duvarci_2014; @gilpin_2015; @mahan_2012], the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored.
Moreover, since distinct nuclei of the amygdala play different roles in fear processing<!--lepiej napisać-->, it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 affect electrophysiological properties and synaptic transmission in those regions.
To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA).
Moreover, considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication, the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of chemokine-modulated effects.
Performing all electrophysiological experiments using acute brain slices pretreated with microglial inhibitor and astrocytic toxin allowed for dissecting local neuro-glial cross-talk in these regions.

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala {#discusscx3cl1bla}


The findings of this study provide evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing their threshold current, significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA synapses. 
These effects were specific for CX3CR1 receptor activation and probably mediated by microglia.

Principal cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are well-known to converge information about both conditional and unconditional stimuli.
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, @nabavi_2014).
Moreover, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.
Accordingly, plasticity at synapses onto principal cells in this region is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and storage of new fear memories [@clem_2010; @blanchard_1972; @johansen_2010; @ledoux_1990; @tye_2008].
Hence, their activity is tightly regulated by a broad array of factors, including a GABAergic system or different types of neuromodulators (@prager_2016 and references therein).
 
Here, the reduced excitability was demonstrated after the CX3CL1 application, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting action potentials.
Thus, the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the principal cells' firing may have significant consequences on BLA physiology.
To block this receptor, two approaches were used. 
Although pre-incubating slices with an antibody against CX3CL1 abolished the observed effect, a small portion of neurons still remained responsive to CX3CL1. 
This may be due to the limited tissue penetration of antibodies, estimated around 50`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m, while slices used for this study were 300`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick. 
Thus another approach was used by employing the pharmacological inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797.
The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures [@lannes_2019] as well as *in vivo* administered both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) [@ho_2020a] and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model [@chen_2020].
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")` [@baxter_2021; @ridderstadwollberg_2014], was also effective in experiments presented here.
Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not affect any measured electrophysiological parameters.
Thus, in the remaining experiments, the concentration of 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`M was applied.

The presented CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP is consistent with many previous studies showing CX3CL1-induced inhibition of LTP or mimicking long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus [@bertollini_2006; @maggi_2009; @ragozzino_2006; @sheridan_2014], without affecting paired-pulse ratio [@bertollini_2006; @ragozzino_2006; @sheridan_2014].
Consistently, in this study, a CX3CL1-mediated increase in the threshold current was observed, leading to a reduction of principal cells' firing.

Many lines of evidence show neuroprotective and beneficial actions of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.
For instance, the expression of CX3CL1 is upregulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission, such as after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus or ischemia, where it is consistently shown to reduce neurotoxicity [@cipriani_2011; @limatola_2005; @tarozzo_2002; @tong_2000; @yeo_2011].
Its beneficial actions were also reported in neurodegenerative models, where it was shown to rescue motor coordination [@morganti_2012] or reduce Tau-pathology [@finneran_2019].
Moreover, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents with a mechanism that involves increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit [@lauro_2008; @limatola_2005; @meucci_1998; @ragozzino_2006], a hallmark of the LTD.
Thus, this predominantly inhibitory role is suggested to be a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010; @sheridan_2014].
Importantly, in the BLA, many disorders are linked with the increased excitability of pyramidal-like cells along with the elevated magnitude of LTP.
Indeed, blocking LTP with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to facilitate extinction [@falls_1992; @sotresbayon_2007; @walker_2002; @yang_2005].<!--nowsze cytowania--><!-- więcej zaburzeń -->
Therefore, considering its well-documented neuroprotective role in other brain structures, the reduced activity of PCs along with impaired LTP in the BLA may suggest the anxiolytic actions of CX3CL1.

Unlike what is observed in the hippocampus, this study did not find any effects of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.<!--jakoś lepiej to napisać?-->
These regional differences between hippocampus and amygdala may be linked to the fact that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, but rather its action is mediated by adenosine, released from microglia upon CX3CR1 receptor activation [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010].
As mentioned in the Introduction (see \@ref(chemointheCNS)) depending on the adenosinergic receptor activation, adenosine exerts opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus [@piccinin_2010].
Specifically, further evidence indicated that CX3CL1-induced adenosine action *via* A~1~R and A~3~R receptor led to decreased glutamatergic transmission [@lauro_2008, @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010], whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-triggered increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC), observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010].
Moreover, @scianni_2013 demonstrated that the CX3CL1-modulated NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs)  elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum by releasing D-serine from glial cells and adenosine, which in turn modulate NMDAR and the A~2A~R subtype.<!-- NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs)  elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum-->
Thus, these findings raise the possibility that CX3CL1 also induces the release of adenosine in the BLA, which in turn, is a downstream molecule of the observed electrophysiological effects.
Consistent with this idea, both A~1~R and A~2A~R receptors were documented to modulate the excitatory AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission and LTP [@simes_2016; @rau_2014; @rau_2015], as it was observed in the hippocampus [@costenla_2011; @demendona_1994; @maggi_2009].<!-- These findings are suggestive of the possible mediation of CX3CL1-induced effects by adenosine. // A1R activation inhibits spontaneous and evoked AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission,13 while A2AR increase the firing rate of BLA pyramidal neurons14 and facilitate long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) of LA population spikes, evoked by stimulating external mainly cortical afferents.15-->
Importantly, while the study documented the activation of A~2A~R elevated the amplitude of NMDA currents in the hippocampus [@dias_2012], decreased NMDA-EPSCs were observed following the bath-application of A~2A~R agonists in the amygdala [@plissova_2020].
This opposing action of adenosine between these two regions on the excitatory synaptic transmission might account for the differences in glutamatergic currents observed in the present study after CX3CL1 treatment.

Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on excitatory synaptic transmission possibly depends upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?-->
As mentioned in the Introduction (see \@ref(chemointheCNS)), distal dendrites of principal neurons receive high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from both within the BLA and outside this structure [@brinleyreed_1995; @farb_1997; @farb_1999].
This subcellular domain is also the target of local somatostatin-positive interneurons [@muller_2007].
Thus, SOM-expressing neurons may influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
As whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study were made from the soma, and the potassium-based intrapipette solution was used, excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites needed to travel more distance, and therefore, could be decreased by GABAergic synapses.
Hence, they might not be detected from baseline noise.
Noting that cesium blocks potassium currents, additional experiments using cesium-based intrapipette solution might resolve whether CX3CL1 mediate changes contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites [@williams_2008].

In addition, the lack of changes in the paired-pulse ratio of field EPSP, together with inconclusive changes in the frequency of sEPSC, implies postsynaptic actions of CX3CL1.
Intriguingly, the suppression of principal cells' firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance.<!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->
The action potentials result from a dynamic interplay between not only the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron but also their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduction of pyramidal-like neurons' firing is the regulation by a GABAergic inhibitory system.
Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the CNS is mediated by the GABA~A~ receptor, a heteropentameric chloride permeable, GABA-gated member of ligand-gated ion channels, whereas slow inhibitory synaptic transmission is associated with GABA~B~ receptor.<!--więcej o nich-->
Indeed, in the presence of the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432, CX3CL1 failed to depolarize threshold current, illustrating that those receptors were involved in this effect.
However, one would expect that reduced principal cells' firing is a consequence of increased inhibition onto those cells.<!--lepiej napisać // -->
In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA, reflected as decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs.
Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) [@bellingham_1996; @doze_1991], sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015 , and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses-->
Moreover, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, whereas a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses [@dekoninck_1994; @otis_1994].<!--bardziej zmienić?-->
Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 treatment, which was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggests a CX3CL1-mediated inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking and/or a decreased reactivity or number of GABA~A~ postsynaptic receptors.
Nevertheless, these results provide direct evidence that CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission within the BLA, probably by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.<!-- może silniej? direct evidence?-->
These data are consistent with findings in other brain regions such as the DRN, where CX3CL1 enhanced postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptor number or sensitivity on serotonergic neurons [@heinisch_2009].
Similar action was reported in another electrophysiological study using human tissue from epileptic patients. 
The epileptic tissue is characterized by more pronounced desensitization of GABA~A~ receptors than healthy tissue, manifested as a decrease in GABA~A~-mediated currents following repetitive GABA applications.
However, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce this rundown in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients [@roseti_2013], illustrating that this chemokine might stabilize GABA~A~ receptor currents.
Hence, both studies reported CX3CL1-triggered modulation of postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, leading to increased sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to GABA inputs.
Importantly, one study also documented that GABA~A~ receptors were involved in the CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP in the dentate gyrus [@sheridan_2014].
While CX3CL1 reduced the magnitude of LTP in the DG, this phenomenon was abolished in the presence of a GABA~A~ blocker.
All these findings, including those presented in this dissertation, highlight that the actions of the chemokine CX3CL1 may vary depending on the balance between excitation and inhibition in the neuronal network.
Thus, at least in the hippocampus, the CX3CL1 neuroprotective inhibition of glutamatergic drive is thought to be present during periods of enhanced excitatory transmission and intact GABA~A~ receptor activity [@sheridan_2014].

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment (AIS) of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, triggered by, for example, changing the action potential threshold (@hjos_2021, @tremblay_2016 and references within).<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. // plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AACs can control action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold, or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014). Accordingly,--><!-- zmienić i przeczytać cytowania? -->

Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs' spiking output and timing [@woodruff_2006].-->
Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin (PV).<!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->
Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some AACs, action potentials can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input [@spampanato_2016; @szabadics_2006; @woodruff_2006]. <!--Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ).--> 
This feedback excitatory input is disynaptic with a latency of `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")` 4 ms and shows a dual pharmacological sensitivity to AMPA and GABA~A~ receptor antagonists [@woodruff_2006], similar to synaptic bursts during oscillations [@perumal_2021].<!-- co to?--><!-- zmienić ...

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by @saha_2016 has shown that specific reduction of a pool of GABAergic synapses innervating the AIS of BLA projection neurons resulted in similar effects observed after acute CX3CL1 application.
Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as well as impaired LTP.
What is more, the decreased excitability of principal cells was associated with increased threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered [@saha_2016; @zonta_2011].
In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, through changing the action potential threshold [@douglas_1990; @somogyi_1982; @veres_2014; @wefelmeyer_2015].<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).-->
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 likely impaired the signaling of this PV-positive specific subtype of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons, leading to the observed increased threshold current.<!-- CX3CL1 likely perturbed the signaling of this specific set of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons. --><!--Following CX3CL1 treatment, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, whereas the input resistance was unaltered. trochę zmienić i zobaczyć czy pisać o action potential hal-width...--><!--The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et al (2011). zmienić i nie rozumiem jak to się ma do całości...--><!-- przeczytać to... // Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF knockdown arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).--> 
In support of this supposition, microglia, the main cell type expressing CX3CR1 receptors in the CNS, were reported to displace the inhibitory synapses at AIS in the cortex [@chen_2014].

<!-- Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). -->
At the network level, while impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA pathway after CX3CL1 application in the BLA is consistent with CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells' excitability, its relation to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first sight.
However, mounting evidence indicates that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons [@mcdonald_2011; @unal_2014], thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the induction of LTP in this structure.
Similar to the cellular level, the chandelier PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation is a good candidate for observed CX3CL1-mediated actions in the BLA.
For instance, it may be related to previous studies suggesting rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA [@woodruff_2010].<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej --> 
Following this idea, CX3CL1 could inhibit those cells, leading to an observed reduction in the BLA network. 
In line with this hypothesis, TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` and IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`, other immune proteins displaying neuromodulatory activity, downstream molecules of CX3CL1 actions in the hippocampus [@rogers_2011], were demonstrated to affect specifically PV-expressing neurons in the striatum [@rossi_2011].
It led to disturbance of network homeostasis manifested as a reduction in GABAergic transmission and abnormal neuronal firing.
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1, probably acting *via* TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`- and/or IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`-dependent mechanisms, might regulate the activity of PV-expressing interneurons, and thus affecting the excitability of PCs. 

Moreover, the external capsule contains mainly cortical fibers [@mahanty_1999].<!-- inputs from cortex-->
Besides targeting principal cells, monosynaptic connections from the cortex recruit local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits [@bazelot_2015; @hbner_2014].<!--There are monosynaptic connections from cortex to the BLA, and, in addition to principal cells, they can recruit local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits. // Monosynaptic cortical – BLA projections exist, and can recruit not only principal cells, but also local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits, but the role of AACs remains unclear (Bazelot et al , 2015; Hübner et al , 2014). sprawdzić te cytowania i to przemyśleć...-->
In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits [@veres_2014].
Accordingly, both types of network mechanisms might be involved when stimulating the external capsule.<!-- this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar local inhibitory networks.-->

Of note, during fear conditioning, conditioned stimuli (CS) were reported to activate PV-expressing interneurons, which in turn inhibited SOM-positive interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of PCs dendrites and the subsequent facilitation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity [@wolff_2014].
Hence, considering the hypothesis that CX3CL1 specifically acts on chandelier cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition of the activity of PV subpopulation in the BLA could prevent this disinhibition, leading to the observed impaired long-term potentiation.<!--poprawić-->

For example, benzodiazepines, which allosterically enhance postsynaptic actions of GABA~A~ receptors, are an early treatment for anxiety and seizure disorders [@farb_2014].
Noting that various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, a better understanding of their specialized roles is of high importance. 

The previously reported the CX3CL1 modulation of GABA~A~ receptors in epileptic tissue [@roseti_2013; @yeo_2011], together with increasing evidence of its regulation of E/I circuits balance (@sheridan_2014, and this study), strongly suggest this molecule as a potential candidate for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy. <!--Various chemokines and their receptors are increased in both parenchymal brain cells and leukocytes in human and experimental epilepsy (Cerri et al., 2017; de Vries et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2018).

## CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala {#discusscx3cl1cea}

In the present study, the CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulation in the CeL circuit was identified.
The application of CX3CL1 on brain slices containing the amygdala resulted in cell-specific changes in the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons, accompanied by affected membrane properties, while membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons were mainly unaffected in response to CX3CL1. 
These changes were accompanied by the modulation of GABAergic transmission by CX3CL1. 

As mentioned in the Introduction (see \@ref(CeA)), the activation of SOM-positive neurons is anxiogenic, as they inhibit PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing, thereby disinhibiting CeM [@ciocchi_2010].
Given that Regular-Spiking neurons correspond to 60% of SOM-positive cells, the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduced excitability of RS cells could prevent CeM disinhibition.
<!--Hence, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 exerts anxiolytic-like action in the CeL by acting on SOM-expressing neurons. NA ODWRÓT!!!!!!!! PRZECIEŻ CX3CL1 hamuje....-->
However, unlike what was observed in the BLA, the reduction of the neuronal firing of Regular-Spiking neurons was manifested not by changes in the threshold current but by a decrease in the overall number of spikes to injections of increasing depolarizing currents.<!-- brzydkie zdanie --><!-- This kind of specificity - other chemokines too - and cx3cl1 - serotonin. rozwinąć // Importantly, this CX3CL1-mediated firing depression was specific to Regular-Spiking neurons, as it was absent in the Late-Firing cells. /// -->
Consistently, in addition to excitability, other membrane properties were altered after CX3CL1 acute treatment. 
Specifically, Regular-Spiking neurons were more depolarized, while their input resistance and time membrane constant were significantly reduced, suggesting the opening of ionic channels.
The observed depolarization of neurons during reduced firing may seem counterintuitive at first; however, this set of changes resembles hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel (HCN) activation, a type of peculiar potassium channel mediating I~h~ currents (for a review: @combe_2021; @kase_2012).<!-- lepiej --> 
Consistent with this speculation, CeA neurons express HCN channels, especially the HCN1 subtype [@chieng_2006; @notomi_2004; @weera_2021]. 
Unfortunately, their role in this circuitry is largely unexplored.<!-- // jakieś cytowania? However, it is speculative whether CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling may be connected to HCN1 modulation, bu scanty evidence is available so far.-->
To the best of my knowledge, although the chemokine modulation of several types of channels was previously reported in many brain regions [@guyon_2005; @guyon_2005a; @guyon_2008a; @guyon_2009; @lax_2002; @oh_2002; @puma_2001; @ragozzino_2006], observations from this study point to a previously unknown link between CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling and HCN channels.

I~h~ currents impact several aspects of neural and network activity.
Specifically, they can depolarize membrane potentials, generate subthreshold oscillations, and synchronize network rhythms [@dickson_2000; @ferrante_2017; @wahlschott_2009].<!--- as relevance of HCN,/// cells. HCN currents influence several aspects of neural and network activity: they can depolarize membrane potentials (inward current), generate subthreshold oscillations, and postinhibitory rebound mediated by Ih may help synchronize network rhythms (Brown and Difrancesco, 1980;Bobker and Williams, 1989;Dickson et al., 2000;Biel et al., 2009;Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009;Ferrante et al., 2017).-->
<!-- zaburzenia które i CeL i CX3CL1 --> 
Noting recent evidence indicating the modulation of HCN channels by other immune proteins, namely interferon `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (IFN`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`) and interferon `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` (IFN`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`) in the cortex [@janach_2020], further investigations are warranted to better characterize the I~h~ activation and inhibition in CeL circuit, especially in the context of neuroimmune regulation and neuron-glial crosstalk.

In contrast to Regular-Spiking neurons, membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons were unaffected by exogenous CX3CL1. 
On the other hand, this chemokine reduced GABAergic synaptic transmission specifically onto those neurons, which was reflected as a decrease in both the median amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs.
It should be noted that CeL neurons are densely interconnected and they form more synapses between different neuronal subtypes (RS`r knitr::asis_output("\U2194")`LF) than those between the same subpopulation (RS`r knitr::asis_output("\U2194")`RS and LF`r knitr::asis_output("\U2194")`LF) [@hou_2016].
<!--Despite the fact that CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes. zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. --><!-- bardziej zmienić Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses [@hou_2016].Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression [@hou_2016]. <!-- zmienić --><!-- the efficacy of the ES ¡ LS or LS ¡ ES synapse was > 2-fold greater than that of the LS ¡ LS or ES ¡ ES synapse. /// density --> 
This connectivity pattern supports the presented data. 
It can be hypothesized that reducing the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons would lead to the downregulated GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing cells.
Hence, Regular-Spiking neurons form more dense and potent synapses onto local, different subpopulations of neurons, e.i., Late-Firing.
Consistently, the CX3CL1-modulated reduction of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons should be more prominent than onto Regular-Spiking cells.


Altogether, this study illustrated that CX3CL1 led to decreased activity in both pyramidal-like cells in the BLA as well as Regular-Spiking neurons in the CeL.
However, while principal cells displayed CX3CL1-mediated elevated threshold current, the lowered gain was observed in Regular-Spiking neurons.
<!-- these effects were a result of different parameters (decreased threshold current in the BLA vs. decreased number of spikes induced by increasing current injections.-->
Thus, probably different downstream events were involved. 
In line with this, altered membrane properties of Regular-Spiking cells were observed following CX3CL1 treatment.
It might, therefore, be conceivable that these membrane changes are associated with the direct activation of CX3CR1 expressed in Regular-Spiking neurons.
The possible candidate is the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of HCN channels in Regular-Spiking cells.
On the contrary, in the BLA, no membrane changes were observed following the CX3CL1 application.
Considering the increased threshold current in BLA PCs, the impaired LTP, and concomitantly decreased frequency of sIPSCs, the CX3CL1 effects on the PV subpopulation of interneurons is speculated. 
However, those hypotheses need to be further verified.<!--PLA, single cell -->
<!-- barwwienia -->
If they are true, the modulation of CX3CL1 and/or its downstream molecules on cellular subpopulations is much more specific than traditionally thought.

## Microglial action in the amygdala {#microfuckingglia}

When discussing potential mechanisms of neuromodulatory actions of the CX3CL1, the controversy regarding the localization of its receptor, CX3CR1, should be acknowledged.
While some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 on microglia [@tarozzo_2003; @cardona_2006], several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and DRN neurons [@hatori_2002; @heinisch_2009; @hughes_2018; @limatola_2005; @maciejewskilenoir_1999; @sheridan_2014; @ruchaya_2012; @ruchaya_2014; @tarozzo_2003; @verge_2004; @zhuang_2007].<!--+ nowsze-->
Here, our immunohistological data from both brain slices and cultured neurons also suggest that CX3CR1 is present on neurons in the amygdala.
Notably, the data presented here do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons, and the possibility that these electrophysiological effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia cannot be ruled out. 

In the past decade, new research has emerged providing evidence and insight into the functions of microglia.
Briefly, those cells are crucial in refining the neuronal network both under physiological and pathological conditions either directly through physical contacts with neurons, by releasing signaling molecules [@tremblay_2010; @wake_2009]<!--jeszcze wydzielanie--> or indirectly *via* interactions with astrocytes [@liddelow_2017]. 
The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is believed to be a key component of the microglia-neuron crosstalk due to its expression pattern [@harrison_1998; @nishiyori_1998; @streit_2005; @szepesi_2018].<!-- better written // One of the key elements in the microglia–neuron crosstalk, deeply linked to the synaptic refinement and modulation, is the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis.<!-- --> 
Thus, most of these studies were done using the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, in which the CX3CR1 receptor  gene  has  been  replaced  by  a  green  fluorescent protein  (GFP)  reporter [@jung_2000].
Given that only microglial cells were identified to express GFP in these mice, all studies using this strain strengthen the notion of a microglial-specific CX3CR1 expression. 
Nevertheless, microglia from CX3CR1-deprived mice show decreased microglial branching and altered motility [@basilico_2019].<!--więcej? --> 
Moreover, the lack of CX3CR1 in knockout mice was shown to alter synaptic transmission [@basilico_2019]<!--więcej-->, plasticity [@maggi_2009; @maggi_2011; @rogers_2011], brain connectivity [@zhan_2014], and behavior [@piirainen_2021; @rogers_2011; @schubert_2018; @zhan_2014].<!-- highlighting ? --><!--zmienić drugą część zdania....  Indeed, the disruption of this neuron–microglia signaling causes several alterations in brain connectivity [22] and cognitive functions [23] associated with an impairment in glutamatergic synaptic transmission [22–26].

Therefore, to identify the involvement of microglia in CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulatory effects observed in this study, a subset of slices was pre-applied with minocycline, which is commonly used to inhibit microglial activation, including in electrophysiological studies (for example: @scianni_2013).

The CX3CL1-mediated downregulation of GABAergic transmission and elevated threshold current in principal cells in the BLA were not observed when minocycline was pre-applied, suggesting that microglia may be involved in this process.<!-- However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).-->
Interestingly, minocycline applied alone was shown to facilitate principal cells' firing and affect the kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.
A similar situation was observed in CeL, where Late-Firing neurons were more excitable following minocycline incubation.
<!-- These unexpected findings ....  -->
Moreover, when both minocycline and CX3CL1 were present, neither the CX3CL1- nor the minocycline-mediated effects were observed, suggesting opposing actions of those molecules in the amygdala.<!--raises the interesting possibility. /// there is a possibility that the mechanisms underlying CX3CL1-mediated increase in threshold current and minocycline-induced actions on glutamatergic transmission and principal-cells activity are independent. // Regardless of the cellular site of this minocycline-induced glutamatergic enhancement, -->
This idea is further supported by a recent study by @yuan_2020, in which they inhibited or activated microglia by infusion into CeA either minocycline or CX3CL1, respectively, and exerted opposite effects on visceral hypersensitivity.<!-- WAS-induced changes in microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in the CeA, and visceral hypersensitivity were reversed by minocycline whereas in stress-naïve rats, fractalkine induced microglial deramification and visceral hypersensitivity.--><!--dodatkowo : PKCdelta - enkefalin - pain -->
However, it should be mentioned that minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that  has powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and  antioxidant properties, which has some other unrelated effects, including direct action on neurons.
Thus, the findings presented in this study do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons or complete inhibition of microglial activity by minocycline.
Therefore, the possibility that the observed effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia or/and direct minocycline actions on neurons cannot be discounted.

It is worth noticing that CX3CL1 was bath-applied onto BLA neurons after the minocycline-induced upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity.
Hence, CX3CL1 might eliminate this minocycline-induced enhancement of glutamatergic drive, supporting the hypothesis that CX3CL1 action depends on the initial state of the network and restoring the disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance [@bertollini_2006; @sheridan_2014].<!-- there is a possibility that the CX3CL1 treatment abolished prior minocycline-mediated elevated excitability of pyramidal-like neurons independently on CX3CR1 activation instead of elimination of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on neuronal firing by minocycline.--> 
This idea is consistent with the observed complex actions of CX3CL1 on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA: CX3CL1 was shown to decrease the frequency of sEPSC mainly onto BLA neurons with higher frequency during baseline, especially at the concentration of 5nM.
In accordance with our data, studies from another group demonstrated the TTX-sensitive modulation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synaptic transmission by CX3CL1, supporting their actions at the network level [@heinisch_2009].
Finally, the potential role in maintaining the E/I balance, along with a TTX-sensitive modulation of synaptic transmission, was also proposed to other chemokines and cytokines, including IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` and TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` [@rossi_2011], suggesting a similar action of immune proteins in the brain physiology.<!-- (citations) --><!--In line with the hypothesis - homeostasis synaptic scaling - there is possibility that, regardless of the mechanism of minocycline-induced increase in PCs' excitability, the lack of observed effects when CX3CL1 is added to pre-applied minocycline is its "normalizing" action.CX3CL1 could decreased the previously elevated PCs' firing as well as kinetics of sEPSCThese issues findings are hard to interpret, especially when ....inspecific many explanations--> 

<!-- Changed kinetics of sEPSC - was previously demonstrated in astrocytes when extrasynaptic AMPA receptors, too much glutamate - 
Thus, minocycline could elevate glutamate by activating extrasynaptic AMPA. -->
<!-- zmienić
Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. 
Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). 
Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. 
Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->

<!--glial impact?
By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

Rats in the minocycline group  showed a gradual decrease of freezing time during the ex-  tinction session, indicating that fear extinction was not disrupted by a single application of minocycline. 

No significant difference in the  number of Iba1-immunopositive cells was detected  between the vehicle and minocycline groups, indicating  that minocycline inhibited IFN-  α  induced activation of  microglia but did not affect microglia under physiological  conditions.  [@bi_2016] - Infusions into BLA

Activation of microglia is associated with  increased release of IL-1  β  and TNF-  α  ,both of which promote hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony via transcriptional or post-transcription  al mechanisms [33, 46].

For instance, minocycline inhibited Na+ currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells ( Kim et al., 2011 ), suppressed Na+ and Ca2+ currents in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ), and reduced evoked synaptic currents ( Cho et al., 2006 ) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents ( Liu et al., 2015 ) in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons. 

minocycline  on sIPSCs and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) in rat spinal SG neurons. 
We found that minocycline largely enhances the frequency,  but  not  the  amplitude,  of  inhibitory postsynaptic   currents   (IPSCs), 


For example, minocycline (50 nM) had no effect on basal excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 ( Pascual et al., 2012 )  or SG neurons ( Berta et al., 2014 ); however, 100 l M minocycline  may  inhibit  dorsal  root  entry  zone stimulation-elicited EPSCs in SG neurons ( Cho et al., 2006 ) or may decrease sEPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ). At a concentration of 200 l M, minocycline may decrease C-fiber evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). In addition, minocycline at 500 l M abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons ( Itoh et al., 2011 ).-->

To sum up, although the underlying cellular mechanisms and the possible regulation of local neuron-glia communication in the amygdala is still largely unknown, this study has shown that both CX3CL1 and minocycline modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala.<!-- ładniej.... --->
Yet, the presented findings do not exclude the CX3CL1 modulation on neurons and their action in an autocrine manner or direct minocycline action on neuronal cells.
However, considering the reported abundance of CX3CR1 expression in microglial cells, along with growing recognition of microglial cells, especially microglia-neuron crosstalk, in the regulation of brain functions under physiological conditions, this scenario is unlikely.
Hence, considering all these issues, the microglial contribution to the observed CX3CL1-mediated effect strongly warrants further investigation.<!--Thus, these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.lepiej napisać-->
