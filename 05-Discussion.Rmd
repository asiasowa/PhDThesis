In this PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and pharmacological approaches, the modulation of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) was dissected based on their ... 

## CX3CL1 in the amygdala

Despite relatively high levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the amygdala and the involvement of this chemokine in anxiety-related behavior, the precise role of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway in the amygdala is still unknown. <!-- lepiej napisać --> 



### CX3CL1 reduces the threshold of the BLA but also the inhibitory synapitic currents and the LTP

Consistent with the literature, as most studies reports the decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission.

The CX3CL1–induced decrease in excitability of BLA principal cells manifested as an increase in threshold current, together with an broadening of action potentials,<!--my chyba tutaj też mamy broadening?--> suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. <!-- CZY NA PEWNO? -->
However, the input resistance following CX3CL1 treatment was unchanged, suggesting that these changes rather are presynaptic. <!--see Appendix-->

why when interneurons abolished there is no effect in threshold current, but sIPSC decreased? but it is consistent, as blocking TTX also abolished this effect :)

This notion was further supported by the observed reduction of sIPSC frequency after CX3CL1 treatment.
Usually, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, while a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of transmitter release and/or changes in the number of active synapses (De Koninck and Mody, 1994; Otis et al , 1994).
The reduction in average median frequency after CX3CL1 application may result from a decreased ..., probably due to decreased number of GABAergic synapses onto principal cells, while the number of postsynaptic GABA~A~receptors remained the same.<!-- jakieś cytowanie?-->
Nevertheless,  our  results  provide  direct  evidence  that  NF knockdown impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA  by  reducing  functional  GABAAreceptors  at  the postsynaptic site. 

GABAergic synapses - subdomain - Moreover, due to its restriction to the AIS, knockdown of NF and the associated reduction in inhibitory inputs may also affect the properties of evoked action potentials. 
Following CX3CL1 treatment, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, whereas the input resistance was unaltered. <!-- trochę zmienić i zobaczyć czy pisać o action potential hal-width...-->
The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et  al (2011). <!-- zmienić -->
Indeed, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at perisomatic ... or AIS.<!--cytations--><!-- Indeed, it has been demonstrated  that  AACs  can  control  action  potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic  inputs, either through changing the action potential  threshold,  or  by  shifting  the  site  of  origin (Douglas  and  Martin,  1990;  Somogyi et    al ,  1982; Wefelmeyer et  al , 2015; Veres et  al , 2014). Accordingly,-->
The only interneuron subtype presently described that innervates the AIS are AACs or chandelier cells (Bazelot et  al , 2015). <!-- zmienić trochę -->
This may happen either *via* changing the action potential threshold or by shifting the site of origin. <!-- zmienić i przeczytać cytowania? -->
Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF  knockdown  arise  by  shifting  the  action  potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et  al , 2005).<!-- przeczytać to... --> 
Moreover, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999).  <!-- zmienić... -->

<!-- Decreasing of the LTP also consistent with previous findings - anxiety - beneficial - sth with synaptic scaling -->
To investigate .... 
While impaired LTP in the vSub – BLA pathway after NF knockdown in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition by NF knockdown appears counterintuitive on first sight. 
However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010). 
Monosynaptic cortical – BLA projections exist <!--cytowanie?-->, and can recruit not only princical cells, but also local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits<!--, but the role of AACs remains unclear (Bazelot et  al , 2015; Hübner et  al , 2014). sprawdzić te cytowania i to przemyśleć...-->
Given that cortical affarents represent <!-- only a minor part of BLA afferents--> substantial part of BLA inputs<!--citations--> and AACs were reported to form reciprocal connections with PCs, they could also be part of local feedback circuits. <!--However, vSub afferents represent  (for example, Canteras et al , 1992) and AACs are also reciprocally connected to projections neurons, suggesting they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al , 2014).-->
Accordingly, this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar  local  inhibitory  networks. <!--trochę jeszcze poprawić?-->
Cumulative evidence suggests that different BLA afferents target specific subpopulations of interneurons (Leitermann et  al , 2016; McDonald et  al , 2011; Unal et  al , 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA local networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure. <!-- ładne zdanie ale trochę zmienić -->
Notably,  the  input – output  curve  revealed  a  trend  for increased BLA excitability in the CX3CL1-supplemented slices,<!--zobaczyć czy to w ogóle prawda xDDD--> which could reflect local network changes that may affect further potentiation. 

Notably, the high variability of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission from cell to cell possibly<!--might?--> depend upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons. 
Given that there are subtypes of interneurons targeting different subcellular domain of principal cells, it is likely that interneurons contacting synapses mainly on distal dendritic parts are ....<!-- dokończyć tutaj i rozpisać jak to jest z tymi interneuronami -->
Thus, experiments in cesium-based interpippette solution might reduce filtering of excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites by blocking potassium channels [@acharjee_2018], and thereby might suppress the high variability of CX3CL1 treatment on sEPSC.<!-- Cesium reduces filtering of the synaptic currents arising from distal parts of the dendrite by blocking the potassium current, and changes in EPSC frequency seen only with cesium internal suggested that most of the changes were contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites.-->

Together, these findings illustrate not only the increasing evidence for a role for BLA glutamatergic inputs to the NA in regulating reinforcement and reward but also that, depending on the part of the NA targeted, other glutamatergic inputs do not necessarily produce identical results <!-- analogous-->

 It is worth noting that, in the experiments where activation of A2AR or A1R was prevented (either pharmacologically or genetically), the effects of CX3CL1 were sustained during chemokine washout. A possible explanation is that these receptors, although not essential for the establishment of synaptic depression, are required for recovery. We may speculate about the functional interaction ( Cunha-Reis et al., 2007 ) of the two subtypes or eventually about the presence in hippocampal tissue of AR heteromers ( Rebola et al., 2005; Ciruela et al., 2006 ), whose activation might have an homeostatic function.
 
 This homeostatic balance between synaptic and intrinsic properties is maintained, in part, via regulation of voltage-gated Na+ currents, resulting in a stable neuronal input–output function.  -> (tectal neurons adapt their intrinsic excitability such that a stable relationship between the total level of synaptic input and tectal neuron spike output is conserved)
 
 However, rather than decreasing interneuron excitability, this effect is associated with an increase in spontaneous firing of interneurons, as indicated by increased sIPSC frequency in pyramidal neurons
 
 These cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b, not only exert their excitatory effects via upregulating excitatory synaptic transmission [30, 31], but also regulate neuronal functions via interacting with modulatory systems [32]
 
 Both LPS injection and CCL2 perfusion onto hippocampal slices increased total neuronal excitability ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G, and 5H), which has contributions from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, as well as the neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties. Consistent with the observed increase in excitatory synaptic transmission and lack of change in inhibitory synaptic transmission ( Figures 5 E, 5F, S7 C, and S7D), the effects of CCL2 were blocked by the AMPA receptor inhibitor NBQX, but not the GABAAreceptor inhibitor gabazine ( Figures S7 E–S7H). CCL2 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability ( Figures S7 I and S7J).
 
 An enhancement of neuronal excitability in the absence of membrane depolarization was previously described in dissociated DRG neurons during exposure to PGE2, which suppresses the sustained Kcurrent (Nicol et al. 1997)

### Minocycline increases excitability of the BLA

Intriguingly, sole minocycline was able to increase the excitability of pyramidal cells.
This result suggests that microglia alone and without stimulation of CX3CR1 receptor  may be able to  affect excitability of neurons in the BLA.
However, as this molecule alone was previously reported to affect electrophysiological properties, such as...., these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.

### Electrophysiological results

The MCP-1–induced reduction in rheobase, together with an increase in spike frequency and a broadening of action potentials, suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. <!-- analogous-->

Yet, our findings do not exclude the neuronal participation in releasing adenosine, thus acting in an autocrine manner, or the adenosine-mediated release of additional neuroprotective factors from glial cells. <!-- analogous-->

Coupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. 

### Validation of AZD8797

The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting action of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures [@lannes_2019]<!--hamster, 10uM--> as well as *in vivo* administrated both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) [@ho_2020a] and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropatic pain model [@chen_2020].

However, this CX3CR1 inhibitor did not change the expression level of the CX3CR1 protein but enhanced the expression level of the CX3CL1 protein. AZD8797 is a non-competitive inhibitor for CX3CR1. The above result suggests that it has no influence on the CX3CR1 protein itself except for affecting  the activation of its downstream signaling pathway. More  intriguingly, AZD8797 increases the expression level of CX3CL1, indicating that there is a feedback loop, probably a compensatory effect after blocking the signaling pathway, which has been pointed out previously but is yet to be further  defined [@cederblad_2016].  - [@chen_2020].

The concentration used here was shown to be effective in previous studies <!-- citations-->

### Microglia and excitatory synaptic transmission 

These results are nicely complemented by findings obtained by studies using mixed neuronal and glial cultures [@ji_2013].
Specifically, adding microglial cells to the hippocampal neuronal culture results in an upregulation of excitatory synaptic currents, together with a higher density of dendritic spines in neurons.
In contrast, microglial depletion from hippocampal organotypic cultures led to both reduction in the dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission. 
Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in adult mice was associated with preventing dendritic spine loss in obese mice [@cope_2018].
These findings strongly support the notion that microglia are key regulators of the dendritic spine density in both the developing and the adult brain. 

Similarly, recordings from CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices of CX3CR1^-/-^ transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability compared to wild-type mice [@basilico_2019], further illustrating that neuron–microglia crosstalk profoundly impacts functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function, and thereby modulating excitatory synaptic transmission.

We measured mEPSC amplitude and frequency at 	 70 mV after 20–24 h of minocycline treatment. We found that minocycline increased mEPSC frequency (), but not amplitude in EAE mice compared with EAE-vehicle-treated mice (). Thus, the EAE phenotype is even more apparent after additional microglial inactivation. However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (  Brundula et al., 2002  ;  Giuliani et al., 2005  ). [@acharjee_2018]

We found that Mac1Saporin injection increased mEPSC frequency (Saporin: 2.3   0.38 Hz, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 3.5   0.21 Hz; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  2.412, df  14; p  0.03), but not amplitude (Saporin: 16   0.685 pA, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 14.8   0.645 pA; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  1.278, df  14; p  0.22) compared  with  Saporin-treated  control mice in the BLA (  Fig. 8  E–G ). These experiments demonstrate that both inhibiting microglial activation and transiently depleting microglia replicate the increased mEPSC frequency seen in the BLA of early EAE animals. 

### CX3CL1 and adenosine
<!-- Of note, sole adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure . -->
Similar to studies concerning the neuroprotective action of CX3CL1 described above, this CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R and, to the lesser extent, A~1~R [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]. 
Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. 

### CX3CL1 and interneurons 
Overall, several lines of evidence described above indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, possibly as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms, required for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010]. 

### Minocycline

However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005)



Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation. However, minocycline also has been reported to directly affect neurons.32,49,50 Multiple lines of evidence have shown the role of minocycline in protecting neurons from apoptosis via inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.30–32,51,52 Our observation of increased neuronal p38 MAPK activity in the CeA raises the possibility that minocycline could have inhibited visceral hypersensitivity through an attenuation of neuronal apoptosis via a direct inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. Therefore, we applied apoptosis analysis in WAS and SHAM animals. - Yuan2020

The identification of AR1as downstream element responsible for beneficial effects of CX3CL1 on neuron survival against Glu neurotoxicity may represent an important challenge for management of neurological disorders including acute brain ischemia.

Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? -->

### CX3CL1 and excitatory synaptic transmission

the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connections formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern.

Here, we report rapid modulatory effects of CX3CL1 on neuronal events in hippocampal tissue. Our data does not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons and we cannot discount the possibility that the effects we see on LTP and calcium influx in neuronal cell types happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglial cell types. If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought. The evidence from rats that CX3CR1 is expressed on hippocampal neuron allows the possibility that, as is the case for CX3CL1-mediated regulation of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal Raphe, glutamatergic neuron-derived CX3CL1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the hippocampus during periods of synaptic plasticity to regulate glutamate-mediated neurotransmission tone.-Sheridan2014

#### CX3CL1 and epilepsy? and GABA

Various chemokines and their receptors are increased in both parenchymal brain cells and leukocytes in human and experimental epilepsy (Cerri et al., 2017; de Vries et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2018). 
In addition to their role as chemotactic molecules that govern the tissue extravasation of peripheral immune cells, chemokines are endowed with neuromodulatory actions which make them potential candidates for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy. For example, fractalkine (CX3CL1) was shown to reduce GABAA use-dependent receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human TLE membranes (Roseti et al., 2013), suggesting it reduces excitability by stabilizing receptor currents.

These data, together with the reported changes in chemokines level in brain and biofluids in epilepsy patients, support a potential involvement of chemokine signaling networks in the pathophysiology of seizures

#### cx3cl1 and y-maze and cognitive AND LTP in the amygdala

DIO mice exhibited significant cognitive deficits in the Y- maze test and decrease in fractalkine and CX3CR1 in the hippocampus and amygdala compared with mice fed a control diet [@kawamura_2021]. 
Our findings revealed that decreased fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the corticolimbic system contrib-utes to the impaired cognition observed in DIO mice in association with decreased expression of glutamate receptor subunits and synaptic components. 
Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of the CX3CR1 antagonist 18a in normal mice induced significant cognitive deficits in the Y- maze test.
Moreover, CX3CR1 antagonist- treated mice exhibited a significant decrease in NR2A, GluR1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus.
Administration of the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor PPP and the TrkB antagonist ANA-12 significantly decreased mRNA expression of fractalkine and CX3CR1 in the hippocampus of normal mice// These findings suggest that the cognitive decline observed in DIO mice is due, at least in part, to reduced fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the corticolimbic system 

The amygdala regulates hippocampal LTP, spatial memory and dentate gyrus field potentials.34 35 
The present study provides the first evidence that DIO mice have significant decrease in fractalkine and CX3CR1 levels in the hippocampus and amygdala, and that the administration of a CX3CR1 antagonist significantly impairs learning and memory in the Y- maze test in normal mice, consistent with cognitive deficits in CX3CR1- deficient mice.20
Moreover, the present study showed that the administration of the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor PPP significantly decreased mRNA expression of fractalkine and CX3CR1 in the hippocampus, providing different lines of evidence that bloodborne IGF-1 is a potent positive regulator for fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the brain.
In addition, the administration of the BDNF receptor TrkB antagonist ANA-12 significantly decreased fractalkine and CX3CR1 levels in the hippocampus in normal mice. The mRNA and protein expression of fractalkine and CX3CR1 is significantly decreased in the hippocampus of BDNF- deficit mice.39 Together, these findings suggest that HFD induces a significant decrease in hippocampal BDNF levels, which in turn decreases fractalkine and CX3CR1 levels in the hippocampus.

 LTP in amygdala is predominantly regulated by glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors, and is considered to be a form of synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory in the hippocampus.8 <!-- trochę bardziej zmienić --> Activation of CX3CR1 on microglia within the CA1 region of the hippocampus triggers the release of adenosine that in turn, via the activation of type A2 adenosine receptors, increases the release of D- serine as a coagonist for NMDA receptors from the glia, leading to a potentiation of NMDA function, suggesting that fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling may enhance LTP as well as learning and memory processes.37 
On the other hand, CX3CR1- deficient mice exhibit impaired LTP in the hippocampus.20 
These findings suggest that the cognitive impairment observed in DIO mice may be due to decreased fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the hippocampus.

 Tetanic stimulation of inputs to interneurons caused an immediate and sustained increase in the efficacy of these synapses.  -> decreasd Freq and AMpl may be also due to instrinsic plasticity at a cell level - as both glu and gaba transmission is impeded, 

### adenosine

Adenosine is a metabolite that acts through different receptor subtypes (Jacobson and Gao, 2006); among them A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we previously demonstrated that CX3CL1 triggers the release of adenosine from neuronal and microglial cells (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). 
Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports de scribe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). [@rosito_2012]

In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).

Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. [@cunha_2001]

###  MICROGLIA-CROSSTALK
The deficiency in microglial CX3CR1 can cause communication defects among neurons, microglia  and astrocytes during numerous c NS diseases or even injuries (Sungho_2010).  The deficiency in microglial CX3CR1 can cause communication defects among neurons, microglia  and astrocytes during numerous c NS diseases or even injuries (Sungho_2010). In addition, c X3cL1 activation is correlated with the specific type of neuropathic pain induced by multiple sclerosis  through interaction with cX3cR1 (Zhu_2013). Moreover, the levels of cX3cL1 are potentially regulated by diverse neurotoxic stimuli and its signaling is correlated with several types of  cNS diseases, including HIV infection, epilepsy, and cerebral tumors among other neuropathologies (limatola_2014) [@chen_2020]

 Notably, previous studies demonstrated that  in vitro lipopolysaccharide- and interferon γ-induced release of multiple cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6) in cultured microglia can be effectively suppressed through the activity  of cX3cL1 signaling. This suggests that cX3cL1/cX3cR1  signaling is vital in modulating upstream production and  cytokine release from microglia (limatola_2014), thereby contributing to  the feedback loop as well. By inhibiting the cx3cl1/cX3cR1  pathway, AZd8797 can suppress the role of microglia and astrocytes, thus preventing the development of the inflammatory response (biber_2014, kasama_2010). The present study shows that blocking  the cX3cR1 signaling with AZd8797 results in, not only a more effectively reduced concentration of the inflammatory  cytokine, I L-1β (which is associated with a better recovery after injury), but also lower apoptosis and necrosis levels when  compared to methylprednisolone treatment.
 
#### LTP in the amygdala

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic activity are currently the best characterized forms of synaptic plasticity and are suggested as physiological substrates of learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Bear and Malenka, 1994; Rioult-Pedotti et al., 1998; Whitlock et al., 2006).

We found significant difference in long- and short-term synaptic plasticity, but not in basal synaptic transmission since there was no difference in I/O curves in slices derived from TPH2− / −or TPH2+/+mice.

Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. [@]

It should be noted that in this study, to induce the long-term potentiation, the TBS was used. 
Often, in the amygdala, as it is a non-laminated structure, the high-frequency stimulation is used instead of TBS. <!-- the protocol 2a). In a next step, we investigated whether the insignificant reduction of LA-LTP induced by HFS observed in slices derived from TPH2− / −mice can be also demonstrated as a modulation of the response to a threshold level of stimulation (TBS), in comparison with the more extensive, supra-threshold stimulation induced by HFS usually used in this non-laminated structure. -->
However, it is more extensive and supra-threshold, thus here the more physiological stimulation was used. 
However, it was documented that this two approaches can led to different results in the BLA [].
Since CX3CL1 is hypothetized to be neuroprotective and reduces the NMDA- and Glu-induced neurotoxity, it is possible that HFS would lead ... <!-- We also found that the induction of LTP in TPH2− / −mice depends on the parameters of the LTP induction protocol. It is known that HFS-induced LTP might be different from LTP induced by learning processes or TBS stimulation (Larson & Lynch, 1989; Larson & Munkacsy, 2015). Such an LTP might be induced differently and is consolidated by different second messenger systems and upregulation of different receptor subtypes. Moreover, because LTP induced by TBS is reportedly more sensitive to changes in GABAAreceptormediated inhibition compared to LTP induced by HFS (Perez, Chapman, Woodhall, Robitaille, & Lacaille, 1999), the magnitude of TBS-induced LA-LTP is usually weaker in a non-laminated structure such as lateral amygdala (Drephal et al., 2006).-->

Unfortunately, there is also possibility that our paired stimuli to measure short-term synaptic plasticity might have induced the long-term depression, as a previous investigation have shown that ... <!--We have shown that paired stimuli with an interstimulus interval of 40 ms applied at external capsule fibers causes LA-LTD, whereas after single pulse low frequency stimulation (900 pulses, 15 min) no LA-LTD can be obtained (Muller et al., 2009).-->

Interestingly, HFS of external capsule fibers reversed LA-LTD to a smaller extent than that observed using HFS of fibers located within the rat LA (Kaschel et al., 2004). The reason might be a stronger activation of GABAergic interneurons by stimulation of external capsule fibers in comparison with intranuclear LA stimulation.

The application of HFS 20 min after completion of paired pulse protocol caused LTP in both brain structures similar to previous findings in horizontal brain slices (Hellner, Walther, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2005; Muller et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2005; Walther et al., 2009).<!-- horizontal, not coronal slices...-->

Besides differences in release probability differences in PPF in the amygdala and the hippocampus, observed in our study might be also due to differences in the density of serotonergic fibers in the CA1 region and the LA (Maddaloni et al., 2017). 

Analogous : NE - Activation of β -receptors, which seems to be present on both pyramidal cells and interneurons at least in the amygdala (Farb, Chang, & LeDoux, 2010) induces the phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunit thereby lowering the threshold for synaptic delivery of GluA1 containing AMPARs during LTP expression. (Hu et al., 2007). Additionally, it has been shown that blocking of β -receptors by propranolol reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs in the LA (Zhou et al., 2015). Consequently, a reduced supply of NA in TPH2− / −mice might lead to a decreased phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunits followed by a reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs, which might cause an attenuated LTP expression.<!-- from [@gebhardt_2019] -->

It is well-known that α2-receptors primarily serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. Activation of α2-receptors exerts inhibition of spontaneous activity (Buffalari & Grace, 2007) probably via inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+channels and activation of inward rectifying K+channels and seems to inhibit both LTP and LTD in the basolateral amygdala (DeBock et al., 2003).

Synaptic plasticity mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors is thought to be a primary mechanism underlying the formation of new memories. Activation of GluN2A NMDA receptor subunits may induce long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas low-frequency stimulation of GluN2B receptors induces long-term depression (LTD).

By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity

We speculate that the persistent CX  3  CL1-mediated potentiation of NMDA function and the consequent calcium  increase could interfere with the complex mechanisms of  LTP induction that depends not only by the precise amplitude but also by the duration of postsynaptic Ca  2+  increase  and by the recent history of synaptic activity. Indeed, it has  been demonstrated that prior activation of NMDAR either  by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation could effectively  inhibit the subsequent LTP induction [72,73]. 

#### CX3CL1 and GABA A and extinction

This idea is in line with the role of NF in GABAergic  transmission.  Several  studies  converge  on showing that extinction training globally increases GABAergic  markers  including  gephyrin  and  GABAAreceptor subunits in the BLA (Chhatwal et  al , 2005; Heldt and Ressler, 2007; Lin et al , 2009), and interfering with GABAA receptor insertion by a TAT-conjugated peptide within BLA synapses impaired fear extinction (Lin et al , 2009). However, the role of specific interneuron subtype inputs remains less well understood. To the best of our knowledge, only one study addressed the role of such specific changes, demonstrating remodeling of perisomatic synapses in contextual fear extinction (Trouche et  al , 2013).<!-- saha 2016? -->

#### CX3CL1 and excitability

Most action potentials that neurons emit during their lifetime are produced by a dynamic interplay between the synaptic inputs and the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron. Activity-dependent or neuromodulatory changes targeting these intrinsic properties effectively regulate intrinsic excitability of the neurons and how they  integrate synaptic input into firing output.

#### CX3CL1, amygdala, and behavior

subsequent studies by many labs showed a huge impact of CX3CR1-deficiency on various behaviors, such as <!--aggression, anxiety, and maternal behavior, but not on the depression-like phenotype -->(reviewed in @paolicelli_2014).

Although a number of brain areas are involved in neuronal circuits activated in the presence of a thread causing fear and anxiety (Belzung, Turiault, & Griebel, 2014; Giustino & Maren, 2015; Tovote, Fadok, & Luthi, 2015), there is a fundamental agreement that LTP-induced changes in synaptic strength in the LA occur during fear learning (Blair, Schafe, Bauer, Rodrigues, & LeDoux, 2001; Maren, 2005; Sah, Westbrook, & Luthi, 2008).
 The observed reduction of LTP magnitude in TPH2− / −mice seems thus to be in agreement with the behavioral data: the TPH2− / −mice showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in three different paradigms: elevated plus maze, marble burying and novelty-suppressed feeding tests (Mosienko et al., 2012). The reduction of LTP in TPH2− / −mice suggests that anxiety vulnerable mice may have difficulty in learning about and predicting when aversive events will occur. It has been shown that fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the LA (Mahan & Ressler, 2012). Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms of metaplasticity at the molecular level.
 
### CX3CL1 and spines

An increased number of synapses could result from more dendritic spines and/or unsilencing of silent synapses. In a silent synapse, an EPSC is absent because of a postsynaptic complement exclusively of NMDA receptors; hence, in the absence of depolarization, it cannot conduct current in response to presynaptic glutamate release. In response to sufficient depolarization, AMPARs can be inserted in the postsynaptic density, thereby making the synapse active or “unsilenced.” To this end, we measured the maximum amplitude of the eEPSC at - 70 mV (AMPAR-mediated) and then at 40 mV, at a 50 ms latency (NMDA-mediated), both in the presence of picrotoxin (  Fig. 2  A ). We found that ratio of AMPA/NMDA eEPSC amplitude was increased in EAE (CFA  3.3   0.41, n  15, N  7; EAE  6.0   1.15; n  13, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  2.335, df  26, p  0.02; 2 cohorts of animals;  Fig. 2  B ). This relative increase in AMPARs suggests increased numbers of functional synapses in response to EAE induction.

We characterized the functional properties of CA3 – CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from these mice and found that they display altered glutamatergic release probability, maintaining immature properties also at late developmental stages.

The connectivity of pyramidal dendrites in cortical multimodal areas, which receive a broad range of inputs at hierarchically higher association levels of integrative processing, show longer, more branched, and have more spines than in areas that process a specific modality of motor or primary sensory activity (Jacobs et al., 2001; Anderson et al., 2009; Kolb and Whishaw, 2015; Hrvoj-Mihic et al., 2017; González-Burgos et al., 2019). Moreover, cortical pyramidal neurons developed basal and apical dendritic domains with different synaptic receptive fields (Larriva-Sahd, 2002; Andersen et al., 2007; Spruston, 2008; Spruston et al., 2013; Larriva-Sahd, 2014). These dendritic segments can (1) compartmentalize signals and/or sum and organize synchronized transmission of information, both of which provide much more computational capabilities for the dynamic processing of information; (2) use passive and/or active membrane properties; (3) show anterograde and retrograde action potentials; and (4) depending on intrinsic membrane properties, impose refractory periods and/or a selective excitability of a specific segment depending on time and distance in the dendritic tree (Oakley et al., 2001; Andersen et al., 2007; Spruston, 2008; Spruston et al., 2013; Almog and Korngreen, 2014; Kastellakis et al., 2016)

The development of particularly specialized neurons involves the structural remodeling of dendritic branches including the occurrence, distribution, density, size, and shape of dendritic spines. Optimal degrees of synaptic connectivity (Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017) could be then associated with dendritic length and branching pattern, spine features, and the neuronal impedance, conductance, and voltage modulatory properties (Papoutsi et al., 2014). More specifically, spines are multifunctional integrative units (Shepherd, 1996) that increase the packing density of synapses by the convolution and interdigitation of cellular membrane, supporting more synapses without increasing the overall volume of the brain (Bourne and Harris, 2009). Dendritic spines provide an enhanced connectivity, modulation of synaptic processing, strength, and plasticity by considerably increasing the computational possibilities between cells (Anderson et al., 2009; Bourne and Harris, 2009; Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Tønnesen and Nägerl, 2016). Spines are specialized postsynaptic elements (see also Shepherd, 1996) that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Only a low percentage of spines (although particularly important, Müllner et al., 2015) is contacted by inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing axon terminals (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014).

According to morphological features, spines have been classified as stubby, wide, thin, mushroom-like, ramified, with a transitional aspect between these classes (as ‘protospines’ or ‘multispines,’ García-López et al., 2010), or “atypical” (also “multimorphic”) with a variety of different shapes, which includes double spines, spines with racemose appendages (with a lobed appearance and various bulbous enlargements and heads), and thorny excrescences (densely packed outgrowths showing fairly large spines with various round heads grouped around the stems) (Fiala and Harris, 1999; Arellano et al., 2007a; González-Burgos et al., 2012; González-Ramírez et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 2014; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Correa-Júnior et al., 2020). Small protrusions extending from the spine are spinules (Brusco et al., 2014; Vásquez et al., 2018), which are active zone-free invaginating structures that can participate in synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (Petralia et al., 2018).

Spines are in a continuum of sizes and shapes and are found isolated or intermingled and forming groups (“clusters”) at the same dendritic branch, between different dendrites of the same neuron, or within the same subpopulation of neurons in a brain area (Fiala and Harris, 1999; Arellano et al., 2007a,b; Chen X. et al., 2011; Yuste, 2013; Rasia-Filho et al., 2012a; Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Brusco et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 2014; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Vásquez et al., 2018; Zancan et al., 2018). Adult human medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA) neurons also show filopodium, large and thin dendritic spines with a gemmule appearance, and diverse synaptic arrangements as en passant, reciprocal, and serial ones (Dall’Oglio et al., 2015). At the ultrastructural level, spines can be monosynaptic or multisynaptic with contacts at the spine head and neck showing both asymmetric and symmetric characteristics (Dall’Oglio et al., 2015).

Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that harbor most excitatory synapses in the brain. The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits. Abnormalities in dendritic spine density and morphology are common pathologies in autism and schizophrenia.

Morphological features of dendritic spines change in response to environmental stimuli and have an impact on the strength of synaptic connections (Araya et al., 2014; Bosch & Hayashi, 2012). Mushroom spines with a large, prominent head and short neck are generally thought to form stronger synapses than thin spines. Stubby spines and filopodial protrusions are considered immature spines that dominate during development, and their percentage in the adult brain is considerably small. The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits. In humans, spinogenesis starts prenatally and can be affected by maternal factors.

A large body of evidence supports the critical role of dendritic spines and their morphology and stability in connectivity and neuronal excit  -  ability [42–44] so the changes in dendritic spine types we found here further suggest a significant impact of CRS exposure on CeA physiology. Indeed, thin spines are motile, transient, and form weak or silent syn  -  apses, whereas spines with large heads (i.e. mushroom and stubby) are more stable and form strong synapses with larger postsynaptic densities, more AMPA-type glutamate receptor content, and larger presynaptic contacts [30,44,45]. ]. Thus, an increase in thin spines in parallel with a decrease in mushroom and stubby spines in CeA neurons, as detected in Golgi-stained apical dendrites after CRS exposure and subsequent to a stress-free recovery period, respectively, may be suggestive of a decreased functional connectivity of CeA projections to downstream brainstem targets [3,17]. 
A closely similar pattern of synaptic remod  -  eling indicative of functional blunting, including decreased dendritic spine density, in parallel with increased numbers of thin spines and decreased amounts of mushroom and stubby spines, has been observed  in pyramidal neurons of the mPFC subsequent to chronic restraint stress in rodents [46,47], whereas increased and decreased numbers of thin and stubby spines, respectively, were reported in the CA1 region of the hippocampus as a result of chronic social defeat in adolescent C57BL/6 mice [48].
In conclusion, the results of the present study using the CRS para  -  digm in rats have provided further evidence that the anxiogenic effects of chronic stress are not apparently associated with remarkable changes of dendritic morphology in pyramidal neurons of the CeA. The data however have revealed more subtle CRS-induced alterations involving structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which are suggestive of a decreased functional connectivity of the CeA. Of particular relevance is the fact that CRS-induced anxiety-like behavior

This inhibition of GABAergic transmission is a result of a D3-like receptor-mediated, dynamin-dependent process that presumably reflects endocytosis of postsynaptic GABAAreceptors found on principal BLA neurons.

Therefore, because of the apparent prominent role played by GABAergic transmission onto neocortical Cajal-Retzius cells, several studies investigated their presynaptic regulation  and functional impact on postsynaptic cellular excitability. The presynaptic origin of GABAergic inputs to neocortical Cajal-Retzius cells includes both long-range fibers originating from subplate neurons, local neocortical interneurons such as Martinotti cells, and layer I unidentified interneurons (1 connection out of 80 pairedrecordings, see Soda et al., 2003

The impact of CX3CL1 on excitatory synaptic transmission appears complex in the amygdala.<!--Irrespective of its cellular origin, the impact of GABAergic input on the excitability of Cajal-Retzius cells appears complex. -->

In the hippocampus, the role of synaptic GABAergic input was studied by .... Unexpectedly,both GABAA receptor–dependent excitation and inhibition were observed. This result was possibly explained by the existence of Cajal-Retzius cells in functionally different (resting vs. spontaneously-firing) states

Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).

Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ). This feedback excitatory input is disynaptic with a latency of  4 ms and shows a dual pharmacological sensitivity to AMPA and GABAA receptor antagonists ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ).

This dual pharmacological sensitivity of this feedback current is similar to the synaptic burst seen during SWs ( Figure 1 ). We therefore investigated a role of these INs in the generation of SWs.


Dopamine in turn, modulates the excitability of cholinergic interneurons by virtue of presynaptic inhibition via D2- receptors and postsynaptic excitation via D1 receptors (Pisani et al., 2000). 

The observed level of somatic variation, dendritic organization, and spine localization is likely to provide important morphological control over the integration of synaptic inputs, which would be expected to influence cellular output and potentially contribute to differences in BLA principal cell physiology.

In infragranular layers, it has been shown that PV cells with translaminar axons had excitatory inputs exhibiting less depression than locally projecting PV basket cells. This was due to expression of presynaptic NMDA receptors in glutamatergic axons contacting translaminar, but not locally projecting, PV INs ( Buchanan et al., 2012 ), which likely participates in making them more responsive to local pyramidal cell inputs ( Bortone et al., 2014 ). This implies that PCs differentiate these PV basket cells as different subtypes

Both LPS injection and CCL2 perfusion onto hippocampal slices increased total neuronal excitability ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G, and 5H), which has contributions from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, as well as the neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties. Consistent with the observed increase in excitatory synaptic transmission and lack of change in inhibitory synaptic transmission ( Figures 5 E, 5F, S7 C, and S7D), the effects of CCL2 were blocked by the AMPA receptor inhibitor NBQX, but not the GABAAreceptor inhibitor gabazine ( Figures S7 E–S7H). CCL2 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability ( Figures S7 I and S7J).

IS might be seen often in Vip cells as a result of their high input resistance, which increases the possibility that noise, an intrinsic subthreshold oscillation, or a small synaptic input will produce sufficient depolarization to reach spike threshold. <!-- but we have decreased input resistance, BUT depolarized...-->

In particular, CXCL1 enhances synaptic transmission (Cui et al., 2012) and can induce intracellular Ca 2+ elevation (Deftu et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2005) and increases Na + currents in neurons (Wang et al., 2008), and these effects were associated with enhanced neuronal excitability.

We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).

Notably, preventing the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons is associated with impaired fear memory formation, and activation of SOMneurons is necessary for fear memory recall and sufficient to drive fear responses.

From a microcircuit point of view, this would fit very well with studies indicating that newborn granule cells are primarily innervated by neurogliaform interneurons (Markwardt et al., 2011), which are a GABAergic target of Cajal-Retzius cells (Quattrocolo andMaccaferri, 2014; Anstötz et al., 2018a). Therefore, an interesting hypothesis that will need to be experimentally validated is that increased functional effects of Cajal-Retzius cells on neurogliaform cells may be required to drive enhanced GABAergic release, which is critical for the synaptic integration of newly generated neurons <!-- analogous-->

From microcircuit point of view, such specificity of activation of specific neuronal subpopulation ...

Since an individual cortical neuron receives input from tens of thousands of other cortical neurons, and in turn projects its output activity patterns to thousands of recipient neurons, the influence of one neuron (or group of neurons) upon another depends critically upon the activity state of all of the neurons that are interconnected with the cells or networks under consideration. In other words, although there is a strong anatomical bias to neuronal interactions, exactly which neuronal subpopulations actively communicate at any particular moment in time (i.e., functional connectivity) depends upon the state of activity in the network itself and can change rapidly to meet behavioral demands. <!-- analogous -->

Consistent with this, Pouille and Scanziani (2004) observed in simultaneous recordings from the soma and the dendrite that during a train of excitatory stimuli in the hippocampus, inhibition first targeted the soma of PCs where PV cell synapses are located and progressively shifted distally, where Sst IN synapses are located

 This delayed pathway was found to be frequency dependent and has been observed in multiple neocortical circuits . 

Therefore, Sst neurons will be sensitive to firing rate increases from even a small number of cells, regardless of their fine temporal relationship. 

In fact, it has been found that a high-frequency train from even a single pyramidal cell can be sufficient to recruit Sst INs . 

In contrast, PV neurons are unlikely to respond to the activity of a single or very few cells because the EPSP from a single PC is too small to reach threshold and the FS IN is less capable of summating consecutive EPSPs due to the their fast kinetics ( Box 1 ). 

Instead, PV INs will be more sensitive to spikes distributed among different cells but occurring in a short time window. 

Thus, Sst INs act as burst and rate detectors, following the most active excitatory cells in the local network, while PV INs follow the different pockets of synchrony in the overall population

Interestingly, these different modes of operation are also reflected in the subcellular target of these IN types. 

Due to their perisomatic bias, PV synaptic contacts are well suited to control the timing of individual sodium spikes, while dendritic-biased Sst neuron synapses gate dendritic integration, calcium spikes, and burst generation. 


Synchronization of spiking activity in neuronal networks is a fundamental process that enables the precise transmission of information to drive behavioural responses1–3.

Various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, and understanding their specialized roles is important. 

Because morphological synaptic growth is normal, we conclude that a homeostatic increase in presynaptic release compensates for impaired muscle excitability. These data demonstrate that a monitor of muscle membrane depolarization is sufficient to initiate synaptic homeostatic compensation <!-- analogous-->

This influence can be assumed to increase reciprocal interactions between CElon and CEloff pathways, thereby boosting the medial CE (CEm) output pathway and contributing to the anxiogenic-like action of SP in the amygdala.

The intrinsic excitability of neurons determines the translationfrom synaptic input to axonal output. Regulation of intrinsicexcitability may therefore constitute a form of cellular plasticity that controls the dynamic range of the input– output relationship. Such a mechanism of cellular plasticity may exist in parallel to synapse-specific mechanisms of plasticity like long-term potentiation and long-term depression.


Coupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. <!-- ...-->
