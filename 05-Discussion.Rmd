# Discussion

Chemokines are a class of small immune proteins emerging as neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication.<!-- Chemokines (chemotaxic cytokines) are a family of small proteins which play a prominent role in the trafficking of immune cells and in the orchestration of inflammatory responses--><!-- Indeed, chemokines  appear  to  play several important roles in neuronal development and in the function of the mature nervous system (Tran and Miller 2003).Chemokine receptors are expressed by diverse populations of neurons and glia.-->
Two of them, i.e., CX3CL1 and CXCL12, are particularly important in this regard, as their crucial involvement in neurodevelopment and regulation of both glial and neuronal cells are well-documented.<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors.
As CXCR4 and CX3CR1 are relatively densely present in the amygdala, the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders, the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored.
Moreover, since distinct nuclei of amygdala play different or specific roles in ...<!--lepiej napisać o różnicach-->, it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 trigger different electrophysiological responses in those regions.
To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA).
Moreover, considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication, the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of observed effects.<!--???-->
Performing all electrophysiological experiments using acute brain slices with microglial inhibitor and astrocytic toxin allowed also for dissecting local neuro-glial cross-talk in these nuclei of the amygdala.<!-- Since all the experiments presented in here were performed using acute brain slices, it cannot be excluded that observed effects might be also mediated by glial cells. analogous -->

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

### CX3CL1 introduciton

<!--Despite relatively high levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the amygdala and the involvement of this chemokine in anxiety-related behavior, the precise role of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway in the amygdala is still unknown. lepiej napisać -->
This dissertation hereby provides evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair: (i) reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing their threshold current, (ii) significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as (iii) impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA synapses. 
These effects were mediated by the CX3CL1 only receptor, CX3CR1, as well as, at least partially, by microglia.
These electrophysiological effects were accompanied by (iv) a more immature phenotype of dendritic spines following acute CX3CL1 application.<!--Although CX3CR1 is widely acknowledged as pivotal for brain development and function, evidence on how it regulates microglial differentiation under psychosocial stress is limited (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017). We hereby provide evidence that CX3CR1 expression was dampened in both CRS animals and schizophrenia patients, and CX3CR1 gene had less interactions with other brain genes in schizophrenia; this receptor was further found to be important for CD206+ microglial subtype differentiation and morphological process arborization, and its deficiency resulted in social dominancy impairment. --><!-- Application of CX3CL1 on acute brain slices led to the following electrophysiological effects: (1) depression of principal cell's excitability, (2) reduction of GABAergic transmission, manifested as a decreased median frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents, (3) the impairment in the long-term potentiation.-->

Excitatory activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region that plays a central role in emotion and motivational processing, is tightly regulated by many signals, including neuromodulators.<!-- lepiej napisać /// external signals?

<!-- Neuroprotective actions -->


Here, we demonstrated that CX3CL1 reduced excitability in these cells, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting action potentials (Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)), <!--One of the main effects induced by CX3CL1 in the BLA is a decreased principal cell's excitability .--><!-- The presented data suggest that although no clear pattern of CX3CL1 on excitatory synaptic transmission was observed, this chemokine suppressed the firing of excitatory principal cells, manifested as an increase in their threshold current. ///needed for eliciting action potentials? the same level of excitability? rheobase?--><!--The CX3CL1–induced decrease in excitability of BLA principal cells manifested as an increase in threshold current, together with an broadening of action potentials,tutaj broadining statistically significant in 2nM, but only tendency in 5nM, w miarę blokowane, najsłabiej przez AZD8797... suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. @sun_2006--><!--One of the main effects induced by CX3CL1 in the BLA is a decreased principal cell's excitability ( Figures \@ref(fig:)--><!--CX3CL1 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability (Figures \@ref(fig:))--><!-- Both LPS injection and CCL2 perfusion onto hippocampal slices increased total neuronal excitability ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G, and 5H), which has contributions from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, as well as the neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties.

<!-- może coś o excitability CX3CR1 i microglia? -->
This effect was dependent on the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1.
To block this receptor, two approaches were used. 
First, before recordings, a subset of slices was incubated with antibodies against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml).<!--jakieć cytowanie które też tak robiło?-->
This manipulation abolished the observed effect; however, a small number of cells still remained responsive to CX3CL1 (Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)b).
Considering the limitation of antibodies penetration, the pharmacological inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797, was employed.
The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures [@lannes_2019]<!--hamster, 10uM--> as well as *in vivo* administered both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) [@ho_2020a] and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model [@chen_2020].
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`, was also used here and was shown to be effective (@baxter_2021; @ridderstadwollberg_2014; see Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)).
Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not elicit any effect.
Thus, in all experiments, 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")` was applied, since at this concentration electrophysiological effects triggered by CX3CL1 were efficiently prevented.
<!--However, this CX3CR1 inhibitor did not change the expression level of the CX3CR1 protein but enhanced the expression level of the CX3CL1 protein. AZD8797 is a non-competitive inhibitor for CX3CR1. The above result suggests that it has no influence on the CX3CR1 protein itself except for affecting  the activation of its downstream signaling pathway. More  intriguingly, AZD8797 increases the expression level of CX3CL1, indicating that there is a feedback loop, probably a compensatory effect after blocking the signaling pathway, which has been pointed out previously but is yet to be further defined [@cederblad_2016].  - [@chen_2020].-->

Notably, suppression of principal cells' firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance (see Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall1) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1membraneappendix)).<!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->
The action potentials that neurons produce are a result of a dynamic interplay between not only the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron, but also their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
Hence, the CX3CL1-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission within BLA was also assessed.<!--cytowanie jakiegos klasyka? // which may be a results of not only neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties, but also from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. --><!--Most action potentials that neurons emit during their lifetime are produced by a dynamic interplay between the synaptic inputs and the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron.

### sEPSC

Unlike what was observed in the hippocampus<!--and ... citations-->[@ragozzino_2006], CX3CL1 application does not clearly reduce excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (Figures \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC) and \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).
<!-- Considering that CX3CL1-mediated reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission was dependent on adenosine, ... in amygdala ... in BLA?--> 
One explanation might be that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission but rather acts *via* downstream molecules (e.g., adenosine), which in turn regulates excitatory transmission in the BLA.
Adenosine is a cellular metabolite that acts through four different G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes (A~1~R, A~2A~R, A~2B~R, and A~3~R; @fredholm_2007), behaving as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level [@boison_2010; @cunha_2001; @ribeiro_2010].<!-- Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. [@cunha_2001]--><!-- In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).-->
Considering previously reported CX3CL1-induced release of this molecule from neuronal and microglial cells [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010], together with adenosine opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus depending on the receptor involved [@piccinin_2010], it is a good potential candidate for observed complex and opposite effects of CX3CL1 modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.<!-- koniecznie lepiej napisać....// Among them, A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we previously demonstrated that CX3CL1 triggers the release of adenosine from neuronal and microglial cells (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). This CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R and, to the lesser extent, A~1~R, in the hippocampus [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]. Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. // Of note, sole adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure . // Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports describe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). [@rosito_2012]-->
<!-- This notion is further supported  by the fact that -- powiązać to jakoś z microglejem? --><!-- The concept that ADO acts as an endogenous modulator able to exert neuroprotective effects through to the control of glutamatergic transmission is well established (Fredholm et al., 2005). In addition, itsroleinmodulationofcellmetabolism(Cunha,2001),neuron-glia communication (Boison et al., 2010), and the tuning of growth factor signaling (Gomes et al., 2011) is becoming evident. Indeed, we and others have recently shown that the chemokine CX3CL1 and the cytokines IL-6 and OSM are able to drive neuroprotection only in the presence of functional A1R (Biber et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2010; Moidunny et al., 2010; Cipriani et al., 2011). In particular, IL-6 and OSM potentiate the expression and the function of neuronal A1R and therefore the ADO effects on neurotransmission and neu roprotection (Moidunny et al., 2010); on the other hand, CX3CL1 neuroprotection is due to ADO release from microglia, activation of A1R, and, possibly, the subsequent release of glial-soluble factors that contribute to neuroprotection (Lauro et al., 2010). In contrast, in the present work we found that CXCL16 exerts neuroprotection against Glu insult only in the presence of functional A3R, the inactivation of all of the other ARs being unable to limit the CXCL16 effect. In rodents, among ARs, A3R has the lower affinity for ADO (Jacobson et al., 1995) and is expressed at low levels in the brain (Ji et al., 1994), including the hippocampus (Dunwiddie et al., 1997; Macek et al., 1998) and the cerebral cortex (Brand et al., 2001). The ability of A3R to contribute to neuroprotection is controversial: in vivo studies suggest that differences in timing of intraperitoneal A3R agonist admin istration may alter the outcome of ischemic brain injury (Von Lubitz et al., 1995, 2001). In vitro studies showed that, depending on brief or prolonged periods of ischemia, A3R mediates effects on neurotrans mission that can shift from protection to injury (Pugliese et al., 2007). In the present study we report data supporting the hypothesis that A3R drives neuroprotective effects, in agreement with the find ing that upon repeated episodes of hypoxia, A3R / mice have a wider neurodegeneration compared with wt (Fedorova et al., 2003), and that central administration of selective A3R agonist reduces isch emic brain injury in mice (Chen et al., 2006).  -->
However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).
<!-- adenosine receptors in the BLA-->

Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission from cell to cell possibly<!--might?--> depends upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?-->
Several microscopic analyses illustrated that principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA<!-- sprawdzić and  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses.<!--citations-->
Mounting evidence shows that <!--in addition to their dendritic and somatic differences in morphology-->BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies, including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons [@mcdonald_2001; @muller_2003; @muller_2005; @muller_2006; @muller_2007].
Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; @mcdonald_2001, @muller_2005, @muller_2006), which will be discussed later in details. 
On the other hand, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons [@muller_2007].
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
<!--Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentialsdirectly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in , dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: @tremblay_2016). -->
As whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study was made from soma, excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites need to travel more distance and can be decreased by GABAergic synapses and, in turn, treated as noise.<!--Given that the the glutamatergic synapses are located on the distal parts of principal cells' dendrites, it is likely that interneurons contacting synapses mainly on distal dendritic parts might decrease the excitatory inputs. -->
If CX3CL1 changes in the frequency of sEPSCs would be seen in experiments using cesium-based intrapipette solution blocking potassium currents, it would suggest that most of the changes is contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites[@acharjee_2018].<!-- Cesium reduces filtering of the synaptic currents arising from distal parts of the dendrite by blocking the potassium current, and changes in EPSC frequency seen only with cesium internal suggested that most of the changes were contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites.--><!-- the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connections formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern. bardziej o ITCs and CeA, ale ładne słownictwo-->
However, this scenario is unlikely, as the proportion of neurons changes of sEPSCs does not change between CX3CL1(2nM) application and CX3CL1(2nM) application with additional presence of picrotoxin and CGP52432, which blocks GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ channels (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).

### GABAergic system

As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduction of pyramidal-like neurons' firing is the regulation by a GABAergic inhibitory system.
Consistent with this idea, this effect was abolished by the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432 (Fig.\@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)), illustrating that those receptors were involved.<!--Consistent with the observed decrease in inhibitory synaptic transmission and lack of change in excitatory synaptic transmission (Figures \@ref(fig:)), the effects of CX3CL1 were abolished by the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432 (Fig. \@ref(fig:))-->
However, one would expect that reduced principal firing is a consequence of increased inhibition onto those cells.<!--lepiej napisać //  -->
In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA (Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC), reflected as decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. 
Usually, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, while a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses [@dekoninck_1994; @otis_1994].<!--bardziej zmienić?-->
Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) [@bellingham_1996; @doze_1991], sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015 , and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses-->
Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 application, while features of mIPSCs remained unchanged, may result from an inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking together with decreased reactivity of GABA~A~ postsynaptic receptors.<!--decreased inputs onto BLA principal cells, probably due to--><!-- Thus, these results  provide  direct  evidence  that CX3CL1 impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA  by  reducing spontaneous spiking of local interneurons.//Nevertheless,  our  results  provide  direct  evidence  that  NF knockdown impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA  by  reducing  functional  GABAAreceptors  at  the postsynaptic site.// Thus, consistent with our previous findings, it is likely that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms contribute to the fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation onto CeL neurons (  Li et al., 2013  ). -->
These observations suggest that CX3CL1 impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA, likely involving both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.<!-- może silniej? direct evidence?-->
The effect of this chemokine is opposite to what was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, where treatment with CX3CL1 led to a presynaptic GABAergic release onto serotoninergic neurons [@heinisch_2009].<!-- Electrophysiology studies indicate aCX3CL1-mediated enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) amplitude and dose-dependent increase of evoked IPSC (eIPSC) amplitude without affecting eIPSC paired–pulse ratio, a finding observed selectively in5-HT neurons.--><!-- Thus, CX3CL1 enhances postsynaptic GABA re-ceptor number or sensitivity on 5-HT DRN neurons underconditions of both spontaneous and synaptically-evokedGABA release. // CX3CL1 may indirectly inhibit 5-HT neuro-transmission by increasing the sensitivity of 5-HT DRN neu-rons to GABA inputs. / GABA-mediated sIPSC recordings were isolated by additionof the non-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H, 4H)-dione (DNQX; 20M) and wererecorded for 6 min.

Moreover, one electrophysiological study using human tissue showed that CX3CL1 induced a reduced use-dependent decrease (i.e., rundown or desensitization) of the repetitive GABA-evoked currents in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients [@roseti_2013].<!--use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the GABA-evoked currents// In particular, the repetitive activation of GABAA receptors produces a use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the evoked currents (IGABA), which is markedly enhanced in the hippocampus and cortex of drug-resistant mTLE patients.-->
It should be noted that epileptic tissue usually is less responsive to the repeated activation of GABA~A~ receptors (i.e., showing increased rundown after repetitive activation) than those from healthy tissue [@ragozzino_2005].<!-- GABAAreceptors from epileptic tissue (hippocampus and neo-cortex) become less responsive to repeated activation (as detected by current rundown) than those from healthy tissue (Palma et al.,2004, 2007a, b;Ragozzino et al.,2005).-->
These results suggest CX3CL1 reduces neuronal excitability by stabilizing GABA~A~ receptor currents.<!--These results are in line with previous report indicating that CX3CL1 reduce GABA~A~ receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human epileptic patients [@roseti_2013]. /// For example, fractalkine (CX3CL1) was shown to reduce GABA~A~ use-dependent receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human TLE membranes (Roseti et al., 2013), suggesting it reduces excitability by stabilizing receptor currents. ///zmienić -->
Hence, how opposite action on the GABAergic system triggered by CX3CL1 in different regions is linked with similar suppression of neuronal firing?

Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials.<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. //  plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated  that  AACs  can  control  action  potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic  inputs, either through changing the action potential  threshold,  or  by  shifting  the  site  of  origin (Douglas  and  Martin,  1990;  Somogyi et    al ,  1982; Wefelmeyer et  al , 2015; Veres et  al , 2014).

Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs' spiking output and timing [@woodruff_2006].-->
Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin (PV).<!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->
Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some chandelier cells, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input [@spampanato_2016; @szabadics_2006; @woodruff_2006]. <!--Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ).--> 
This feedback excitatory input is disynaptic with a latency of `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")` 4 ms and shows a dual pharmacological sensitivity to AMPA and GABA~A~ receptor antagonists [@woodruff_2006], similar to synaptic bursts seen during oscillations [@perumal_2021].<!-- co to?--><!-- zmienić ...

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by @saha_2016 has shown that exclusive reduction of a pool of  GABAergic  synapses  innervating  the  AIS  of  BLA projection neurons resulted in similar differences observed after acute CX3CL1 application.
Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as well as impaired LTP.
What is more, the decreased excitability of principal cells  was associated with depolarized threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered [@saha_2016; @zonta_2011].
In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential  threshold  or  by  shifting  the  site  of  origin (Douglas  and  Martin,  1990;  Somogyi et    al ,  1982; Wefelmeyer et  al , 2015; Veres et  al , 2014).<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise  by  shifting  the  action  potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et  al , 2005).-->
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 likely perturbed the signaling of this PV-positive specific set of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons.<!-- CX3CL1 likely perturbed the signaling of this specific set of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons. --><!--Following CX3CL1 treatment, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, whereas the input resistance was unaltered. trochę zmienić i zobaczyć czy pisać o action potential hal-width...--><!--The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et al (2011). zmienić i nie rozumiem jak to się ma do całości...--><!-- przeczytać to... // Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF  knockdown  arise  by  shifting  the  action  potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et  al , 2005).--> 
Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). 

### LTP

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic activity are currently the best characterized forms of synaptic plasticity and are suggested as physiological substrates of learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Bear and Malenka, 1994; Rioult-Pedotti et al., 1998; Whitlock et al., 2006).<!--zmienić, cytowania // Synaptic plasticity mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors is thought to be a primary mechanism underlying the formation of new memories. Activation of GluN2A NMDA receptor subunits may induce long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas low-frequency stimulation of GluN2B receptors induces long-term depression (LTD).-->
<!-- Decreasing of the LTP also consistent with previous findings - anxiety - beneficial - sth with synaptic scaling -->
However, as amygdala is related with fear-conditioning, LTP in this region is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and storage of new fear memories.
Indeed, blocking LTP with NMDA receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to facilitate extinctions.<!--citations i może bardziej zmienić--><!--For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity that mediates the acquisition and storage of new fear memories, particularly in the lateral nuclei of the amygdala. Treatments that block LTP, such as NMDA receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors, disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear (Falls et al, 1992; Vianna et al, 2001; Santini et al, 2004; Sotres-Bayon et al, 2007). Conversely, drugs that promote LTP can facilitate extinction (Walker and Davis, 2002; Yang and Lu, 2005).-->
Moreover, and adult-like LTP of amygdala afferents emerges during infancy when the amygdala begins to contribute to fear learning (Thompson et al. 2008).<!--zmienic-->
At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS (e.g., terminals from the auditory thalamus and cortex) and a strong input carrying US information (e.g., footshock).
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, @nabavi_2014). 
Accordingly, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.

<!-- previous reports on CX3CL1 and LTP - sheridan 2014 - picrotoxin, and sth with NMDA --><!--Overall, several lines of evidence described above indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, possibly as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms, required for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010].  i tutaj o tym, że blokując interneurony mamy podwyższenie LTP sheridan 2014-->

While impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA pathway after CX3CL1 treatment in the BLA is consistent with CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells' excitability, its relation to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first sight.<!-- While impaired LTP in the vSub – BLA pathway after NF knockdown in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition by NF knockdown appears counterintuitive on first sight. // Because a large majority of the inhibitory signaling within the BLA is provided by locally projecting interneurons, one would expect reductions in interneuron synaptic number and/or activity to have a profound effect on the excitatory output of this region. 
Inhibitory synaptic plasticity has previously been demonstrated within the BLA (Szinyei et al. 2007), and reduced GABAergic activity facilitates long-term potentiation of thalamic input to the lateral amygdala (Bissiere et al. 2003).--> 
However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA [@woodruff_2010].<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej -->

In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits [@veres_2014]. <!--Given that cortical afferents represent only a minor part of BLA afferents substantial part of BLA inputs and AACs were reported to form reciprocal connections with PCs, they could also be part of local feedback circuits.// However, vSub afferents represent  (for example, Canteras et al , 1992) and AACs are also reciprocally connected to projections neurons, suggesting they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al , 2014).-->
<!--Accordingly, this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar  local inhibitory  networks. ///trochę jeszcze poprawić?-->
Mounting evidence indicates that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons [@mcdonald_2011; @unal_2014], thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the induction of LTP in this structure.<!-- ładne zdanie ale trochę zmienić /// Increasing evidence suggests that different BLA afferents target specific subpopulations of interneurons (Leitermann et  al , 2016; McDonald et  al , 2011; Unal et  al , 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA local networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure-->
Interestingly, it has been shown that conditioned stimuli (CS) activate PV-expressing interneurons during fear conditioning, which in turn inhibit SOM-positive interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of PCs dendrites which facilitate excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).<!-- inaczej napisać Interestingly, it has been shown that conditioned stimuli (CS) activate PV INs during fear conditioning, which in turn inhibit SOM INs, resulting in a disinhibition of PN dendrites which facilitates excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).-->
Hence, in line with hypothesis that CX3CL1 mostly inhibit chandelier cells, this chemokine would prevent activation of those cells during fear-conditioning and thus impair long-term potentiation, thereby serving anxiolytic effects.<!--poprawić-->

### SPINES 

Complementary to the synaptic plasticity data, the alternations in dendritic morphology was observed in the cultured neurons from the rat pups amygdala.<!--Moreover, accompanying the CX3CL1-mediated LTP impairment was the immature morphology of dendritic spines.-->
Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014), while GABAergic terminals contact only a low proportion of them  (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014,  Müllner et al., 2015).<!--zmienić Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that harbor most excitatory synapses in the brain. /// Spines are specialized postsynaptic elements (see also Shepherd, 1996) that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Only a low percentage of spines (although particularly important, Müllner et al., 2015) is contacted by inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing axon terminals (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014).--> 
<!--Dendritic spines provide an enhanced connectivity, modulation of synaptic processing, strength, and plasticity by considerably increasing the computational possibilities between cells (Anderson et al., 2009; Bourne and Harris, 2009; Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Tønnesen and Nägerl, 2016). zmienić-->
<!--The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission, plasticity, and formation of neuronal circuits. zmienić --> 
<!--Abnormalities in dendritic spine density and morphology are common pathologies in autism and schizophrenia. zmienić -->
A large body of evidence supports the critical role of dendritic spines and their morphology in neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity [@harms_2007; @hering_2001; @kasai_2003].<!-- citation [42–44] zmienić--><!--Morphological features of dendritic spines change in response to environmental stimuli and have an impact on the strength of synaptic connections (Araya et al., 2014; Bosch & Hayashi, 2012).--><!--The size and geometry of the spine head and neck are believed to be main determinants in synaptic signal compartmentalization, strength and specificity [1], [18].--><!--The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits/// zmienić/// Thus, dendritic spine morphology is tightly correlated with synaptic function [@nishiyama_2019].///Therefore, it is plausible that long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two major forms of synaptic plasticity, are correlated with the spine enlargement and shrinkage, respectively [@nishiyama_2019]. -->
Thus, observed changes in dendritic spine morphology further suggest a significant impact of CX3CL1 acute application on the BLA physiology.
Indeed, spines with large, prominent heads and short necks are generally thought to be stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and form stronger synaptic connections than thin spines [@ganeshina_2004; @harris_1992; @kasai_2003].<!--Mushroom spines with a large, prominent head and short neck are generally thought to form stronger synapses than thin spines. zmienić // Spines with large heads are stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and contribute to strong synaptic connections. // Indeed, thin spines are motile, transient, and form weak or silent synapses, whereas spines with large heads (i.e. mushroom and stubby) are more stable and form strong synapses with larger postsynaptic densities, more AMPA-type glutamate receptor content, and larger presynaptic contacts [30,44,45].--> 
By contrast, spines with small heads and filopodial protrusions are regarded as immature spines as they dominate during development, being motile and unstable, and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections.<!--zmienić Stubby spines and filopodial protrusions are considered immature spines that dominate during development, and their percentage in the adult brain is considerably small.// By contrast, spines with small heads are motile and unstable and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections.--><!--Therefore, it is plausible that long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two major forms of synaptic plasticity, are correlated with the spine enlargement and shrinkage, respectively [@nishiyama_2019].bardziej zmienić-->
Thus, observed in the present study an increase in length of dendritic spines together with a decrease in their head in neurons may be suggestive of immature morphology and decreased functional connectivity within the amygdala. <!--of CeA projections to downstream brainstem targets [3,17].-->

Considering increasing evidence that dendritic spine enlargement of amygdala neurons is associated with stressful or anxiogenic conditions<!-- citations-->, one might speculate that this phenotype might be linked to CX3CL1 anxiolytic actions. 
However, a similar pattern of synaptic remodeling indicative of immature morphology<!-- , including decreased dendritic spine density, in parallel with increased numbers of thin spines and decreased amounts of mushroom and stubby spines,--> has been observed  in the rodent model of autism spectrum disorders [@kim_2017a].<!--pyramidal neurons of the mPFC subsequent to chronic restraint stress in rodents --><!--However, immature dendritic filopodia were also increased in rodent model of autism spectrium disorders [@kim_2017a]?--><!--Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by various genetic and environmental factors that result in synaptic abnormalities.

However, the precise roles of microglial autophagy in synapses and ASDs are unknown. Here, we show that microglial autophagy is involved in synaptic re fi nement and neurobehavior regulation.

<!-- A parallel increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and change in AMPAR dynamics is also consistent with an increase in the number of mature functional synapses and dendritic spines in response to EAE induction (Danglot et al., 2012; Hanse et al., 2013).

The AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).- Acharjee2018b-->

<!-- amygdala development
Rodent research has identified maturation of amygdala neurons throughout infancy and into adolescence (Fig. 3). 
The amygdala emerges during gestation in rats (Berdel et al. 1997a) and undergoes volumetric changes soon after birth (Berdel et al. 1997b; Chareyron et al. 2012). 
As the region grows individual amygdala neurons mature, exhibiting pronounced dendritic expansion and emergence of dendritic spines between birth and adolescence (Ryan et al. 2014). 
Concomitant with structural maturation are pronounced electrophysiological changes in the amygdala. 
During infancy, amygdala neurons become an order of magnitude less excitable and lose their propensity to fire bursts of action potentials (Ehrlich et al. 2012). 
Synaptic transmission in the amygdala is also refined during this period (Bosch & Ehrlich 2015; Ehrlich et al. 2013), and adult-like LTP of amygdala afferents emerges during infancy when the amygdala begins to contribute to fear learning (Thompson et al. 2008).-->

<!-- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ERK and CREB also regulate neuron morphogenesis, shaping dendrite patterning and the growth of dendritic spines. 
For instance, BDNF application to developing neurons in culture promotes spinogenesis in a neural activity- and TrkB-dependent manner (Shimada et al. 1998; Tyler & Pozzo-Miller 2003). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor acts via TrkB to enable structural plasticity, destabilizing dendrites and dendritic spines of cortical neurons (Horch et al. 1999) and elevating spine density of dendrites (Sanchez et al. 2006). 
Consistent with its role in signal transduction, BDNF promotes robust dendritic outgrowth from developing cortical neurons in a neural activity-dependent manner (McAllister et al. 1996), and BDNF is required for dendritic spine enlargement following paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation at individual synapses (Tanaka et al. 2008). 
Such BDNF-mediated increases in dendritic spine density also require ERK signaling (Alonso et al. 2004). -->
<!--Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ERK and CREB promote dendrite expansion and spinogenesis (Alonso et al. 2004; Herold et al. 2011; McAllister et al. 1995), and excessive activation of this pathway may alter amygdala neuron morphology. 
Dendrite growth and spine emergence proceed into early adolescence in the amygdala (Ryan et al. 2014). 
In juveniles, amygdala-dependent learning and BDNF–ERK–CREB signaling may cause enlarged or more spine-dense dendrites later in life. 
As dendrites constitute the major site for synaptic input onto amygdala neurons, dendritic expansion may result in greater synaptic input to amygdala neurons and more capacity for learning related to motivationally relevant stimuli. 
Interestingly, stress exposure during adolescence causes enlargement of amygdala neuron dendritic arbors (Eiland et al. 2012), which has been suggested to mediate some adverse behavioral effects of chronic stress (McEwen & Chattarji 2004).

These features are concordant with an increased number of synapses, an interpretation supported by our Golgi stains where we found a greater density of dendritic spines in EAE mice.  -->



Although dendritic spine imaging and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (neuronal cultures vs. acute slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CX3CL1 in both systems.<!-- analogous to CX3CL1 dendritic spines and electrophysiology -->
However, it should be noted that neuronal cultures were deprived of microglial cells, thus either pure neuronal effect on dendritic spines is observed, or astroglia were involved.<!--Arac nie jest anty-astroglia? // Since in the coculture experiments astrocytes were not completely devoid of microglia cells (representing 4–6% of total cells), we could not rule out that astrocytes-microglia cross talk was necessary for CXCL16mediated neuroprotection.-->

### microglia and independent CX3CL1 mechanisms of action in the BLA / minocycline


Considering the exceptional communication between neuronally secreted CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 on microglial cells, together the key role of microglia in sensing neuronal microenvironment ( Davalos et al., 2005 ), it was not surprising to discover that some of the effects of CX3CL1 are also mediated by these glial cells. <!-- Trettel 2020 --><!-- analogous?-->

However, 
However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005).
Thus, to determine further whether microglia specifically control synaptic transmission in the BLA, we injected Saporin toxin conjugated to macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1, integrin CD11b/ CD18 receptor localized to microglia) directly into the BLA of 8-week-old C57BL/6N females to transiently deplete microglia. IgG-Saporin, which does not bind to any specific receptor, was used as a control.;;

Therefore, fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling is postulated to represent a primary neuron–glia inter- regulatory system that is important for brain function.18

We have previously shown that another transmembrane chemokine, CX3CL1, induces protection of hippocampal neurons from Glu-induced excitotoxicity with a mechanism mediated by microglia (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). <!-- opposite -->
the inhibition of microglia activation selectively prevented CX3CL1-induced neuroprotection, while CXCL16 was still able to rescue neurons from cell death (Fig. 4 A , n 4–5; p 0.05) indicating that microglia activation is not required for CXCL16-mediated neuroprotection.

The deficiency in microglial CX3CR1 can cause communication defects among neurons, microglia  and astrocytes during numerous c NS diseases or even injuries (Sungho_2010). 
In addition, c X3cL1 activation is correlated with the specific type of neuropathic pain induced by multiple sclerosis  through interaction with cX3cR1 (Zhu_2013). Moreover, the levels of cX3cL1 are potentially regulated by diverse neurotoxic stimuli and its signaling is correlated with several types of  cNS diseases, including HIV infection, epilepsy, and cerebral tumors among other neuropathologies (limatola_2014) [@chen_2020]

 Notably, previous studies demonstrated that  in vitro lipopolysaccharide- and interferon γ-induced release of multiple cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6) in cultured microglia can be effectively suppressed through the activity  of cX3cL1 signaling. 
 This suggests that cX3cL1/cX3cR1  signaling is vital in modulating upstream production and  cytokine release from microglia (limatola_2014), thereby contributing to  the feedback loop as well. By inhibiting the cx3cl1/cX3cR1  pathway, AZd8797 can suppress the role of microglia and astrocytes, thus preventing the development of the inflammatory response (biber_2014, kasama_2010). 
 The present study shows that blocking  the cX3cR1 signaling with AZd8797 results in, not only a more effectively reduced concentration of the inflammatory  cytokine, I L-1β (which is associated with a better recovery after injury), but also lower apoptosis and necrosis levels when  compared to methylprednisolone treatment.

Intriguingly, sole minocycline was able to increase the excitability of pyramidal cells in the BLA.
This result suggests that microglia alone and without stimulation of CX3CR1 receptor<!--using CX3CR1 independent mechanisms?--> may be able to affect excitability of neurons in the BLA.
However, as this molecule alone was previously reported to affect electrophysiological properties, such as...., these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.

We measured mEPSC amplitude and frequency at 	 70 mV after 20–24 h of minocycline treatment. 
We found that minocycline increased mEPSC frequency (), but not amplitude in EAE mice compared with EAE-vehicle-treated mice (). 
Thus, the EAE phenotype is even more apparent after additional microglial inactivation. 
However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (  Brundula et al., 2002  ;  Giuliani et al., 2005  ). [@acharjee_2018]

We found that Mac1Saporin injection increased mEPSC frequency (Saporin: 2.3   0.38 Hz, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 3.5   0.21 Hz; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  2.412, df  14; p  0.03), but not amplitude (Saporin: 16   0.685 pA, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 14.8   0.645 pA; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  1.278, df  14; p  0.22) compared  with  Saporin-treated  control mice in the BLA (  Fig. 8  E–G ). 
These experiments demonstrate that both inhibiting microglial activation and transiently depleting microglia replicate the increased mEPSC frequency seen in the BLA of early EAE animals.

Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->

However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005)

Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation. However, minocycline also has been reported to directly affect neurons.32,49,50 Multiple lines of evidence have shown the role of minocycline in protecting neurons from apoptosis via inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.30–32,51,52 Our observation of increased neuronal p38 MAPK activity in the CeA raises the possibility that minocycline could have inhibited visceral hypersensitivity through an attenuation of neuronal apoptosis via a direct inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. Therefore, we applied apoptosis analysis in WAS and SHAM animals. - Yuan2020

Generally, the increase in sIPSC or sEPSC frequency enhanced the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the effect of minocycline on SG neurons is mainly of a presynaptic origin rather than a postsynaptic origin

### dose?

For example, CX3CR1 dose-depen-dently stimulates calcium mobilization in CX3CR1-expressingcells with an EC50 of 2 nM (Imai et al., 1997). CX3CL1 also dose-dependently reduces glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in hippocam-pal neurons with an EC50 of 0.7 nM (Limatola et al., 2005). Finally,CX3CL1 dose-dependently inhibits field excitatory postsynaptic po-tentials (Bertollini et al., 2006) and evoked excitatory postsynapticcurrent amplitude (Ragozzino et al., 2006) in hippocampal neuronswith an EC50 of 0.7 and 1.0 nM, respectivel

At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000; Cambien et al., 2001; Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2009)

While previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 causes an increase in intracellular calcium in neurons and other cell types (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Ragozzino et al., 2006) this effect of CX3CL1 becomes apparent at concentrations of 25 nM and higher (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004), well above the levels we investigated here and we observed no such increase in intracellular calcium. At a concentration of 2 nM, in both neurons and non-neurons, CX3CL1 pre-incubation suppressed glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium levels. These data are in good agreement with previous findings of a protective effect of inflammatory levels of CX3CL1 against glutamate excitotoxicity and glutamate NMDA receptor activation, in particular (Meucci et al., 1998; Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005), although, unlike the current work, the latter effect was linked to increased intracellular calcium (Ragozzino et al., 2006). Calcium oscillations in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells are important for cellular growth, migration and synaptic structural refinement (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Komuro and Rakic, 1998; Spitzer et al., 2000). Thus, the dampening of such signaling by CX3CL1 is suggestive of a role in stability of network connectivity and activity. Overall, the current data along with information in the published literature reveal that a role for CX3CL1 in control of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission during excitotoxic events can be extended to situations of synaptic plasticity required for normal functions such as memory formation.

<!--Neuromodulation?
It should be noted that immune proteins, including CX3CL1, exerts their neuromodulatory role not only by directly acting on GABAergic and glutamatergic systems or neuronal properties, but also indirectly by affecting other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators.
Accordingly, ...
NE - Activation of β -receptors, which seems to be present on both pyramidal cells and interneurons at least in the amygdala (Farb, Chang, & LeDoux, 2010) induces the phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunit thereby lowering the threshold for synaptic delivery of GluA1 containing AMPARs during LTP expression. (Hu et al., 2007). 
Additionally, it has been shown that blocking of β -receptors by propranolol reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs in the LA (Zhou et al., 2015). 
Consequently, a reduced supply of NA in TPH2− / −mice might lead to a decreased phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunits followed by a reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs, which might cause an attenuated LTP expression. from [@gebhardt_2019] 

It is well-known that α2-receptors primarily serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. Activation of α2-receptors exerts inhibition of spontaneous activity (Buffalari & Grace, 2007) probably via inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+channels and activation of inward rectifying K+channels and seems to inhibit both LTP and LTD in the basolateral amygdala (DeBock et al., 2003).

Thus, in mice lacking brain serotonin we found long-term plasticity changes both in the amygdala and in the hippocampus. 
Priming of LTP by prior paired pulse stimulation seemed to compensate the deficits of serotonin in the brain at the level of the functional readout.

Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

<!-- PPR
In PPF (at multiple synapses), the second pair of stimuli separated by a few tens of milliseconds produces a larger synaptic response than the first, owing to the transient elevation of Ca2^+^ in terminal boutons produced by the second stimulus summing with the residual Ca2^+^ produced by the first stimulus, and increasing the probability of transmitter release. 
Since probability of transmitter release cannot exceed 1, the PPF ratio tends to decrease as probability of release increases (Bliss & Collingridge, 2013). 
Therefore, in the LA the glutamate release in response to paired pulse stimulation seems to be reduced in TPH2− / −mice.

### general summary

The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. 
Consistently, disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the BLA causes a disturbance of the excitatory/inhibitory balance and has been implicated in many neurobiological diseases, such as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or epilepsy (for a comprehensive review: @prager_2016).<!-- // original: Pathological disruption of GABA~A~ receptors causes a disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory balance and has been increasingly implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (Deidda et al., 2014) // The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. --><!-- BLA hyperexcitability manifests behaviorally as an increase in anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or development of seizure activity.-->

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

Various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, and understanding their specialized roles is important. 

Yet, our findings do not exclude the neuronal participation in releasing adenosine, thus acting in an autocrine manner, or the adenosine-mediated release of additional neuroprotective factors from glial cells.<!-- analogous-->

It should be noted also that immune proteins, such as TNFalpha or IL-1b do not only exert their effect by modulating synaptic transmission, but also *via* interacting with modulatory systems.<!-- citations--><!-- These cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b, not only exert their excitatory effects via upregulating excitatory synaptic transmission [30, 31], but also regulate neuronal functions via interacting with modulatory systems [32]-->

Here, we report rapid modulatory effects of CX3CL1 on neuronal events in hippocampal tissue. <!--Sheridan2014--> 
Our data does not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons and we cannot discount the possibility that the effects we see on LTP and calcium influx in neuronal cell types happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglial cell types. <!--Sheridan2014-->
If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought. <!--Sheridan2014-->
The evidence from rats that CX3CR1 is expressed on hippocampal neuron allows the possibility that, as is the case for CX3CL1-mediated regulation of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal Raphe, glutamatergic neuron-derived CX3CL1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the hippocampus during periods of synaptic plasticity to regulate glutamate-mediated neurotransmission tone.<!--Sheridan2014-->

We believe that our technique is well suited to investigate changes in BLA morphology and activity, which have been implicated in a number of disease states, including posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction (Koob et al. 2014; Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). 
Posttraumatic stress disorder and other forms of chronic stress are often associated with increases in amygdala activity, resulting in the dysregulation of fear responses and causing sensitization to stressful stimuli (Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). Previous studies have shown that emotional responses generated by the BLA may result from increased excitatory input and changes in glutamate receptor ratios (Christian et al. 2012; Hubert et al. 2014; LeDoux 2003) and repeated restraint stress can cause changes in BLA spine localization (Padival et al. 2013). 
It would be interesting to investigate whether these changes result from altered levels of not only excitatory input but also inhibitory synapses within the BLA and other nuclei within the amygdala. <!-- klenowski_2015-->

Feng et al. found another potential therapy for regulate stress is motilin which can weaken anxiety-like behavior in rats after they have been subjected to forced swimming. Whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices revealed that motilin depolarized the interneurons and promoted GABAergic transmission in the BLA (Feng et al., 2013).

 It is worth noting that the HPA axis can mediate the stress response because it is a neuroendocrine system. Some researchers looked at the effects of rapid glucocorticoid-induced acute stress in the rat BLA. Glucocorticoid administrated to amygdala slices produced a rapid, non-reversible suppression of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents (Di et al., 2016). The acute administration of glucocorticoid receptor agonist DEX also upregulated GABA release and GABAergic neuronal spiking (Wang et al., 2016).
 
 Aroniadou et al. reported a key role of the amygdala’s GABAergic control in epilepsy. The stress-induced damage to the noradrenergic system, promoting GABA release in the BLA, may underlie the stress-induced exacerbation of seizure activity in epileptic patients (Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2007).
 
 A more complete understanding of the intrinsic excitatory/inhibitory circuit balance of the amygdala and how imbalances in inhibitory control contribute to excessive BLA excitability will guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric diseases <!-- ładne conclusion -->
 
 The observed level of somatic variation, dendritic organization, and spine localization is likely to provide important morphological control over the integration of synaptic inputs, which would be expected to influence cellular output and potentially contribute to differences in BLA principal cell physiology.
 
Although a number of brain areas are involved in neuronal circuits activated in the presence of a thread causing fear and anxiety (Belzung, Turiault, & Griebel, 2014; Giustino & Maren, 2015; Tovote, Fadok, & Luthi, 2015), there is a fundamental agreement that LTP-induced changes in synaptic strength in the LA occur during fear learning (Blair, Schafe, Bauer, Rodrigues, & LeDoux, 2001; Maren, 2005; Sah, Westbrook, & Luthi, 2008).
The observed reduction of LTP magnitude after CX3CL1 application might suggests that anxiety vulnerable mice may have difficulty in learning about and predicting when aversive events will occur. 
It has been shown that fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the LA (Mahan & Ressler, 2012). 
Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms of metaplasticity at the molecular level.

Learning about motivationally important stimuli involves plasticity in the amygdala, a temporal lobe structure. Amygdala-dependent learning involves a growing number of plasticity-related signaling pathways also implicated in brain development, suggesting that learning-related signaling in juveniles may simultaneously influence development. 

Recent studies indicate that the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CeL) is essential for fear learning. Specifically, fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific synaptic plasticity in CeL neurons that is required for the storage of fear memories.<!--peennzoo-->

These long-range projection CeL neurons are predominantly somatostatin-positive (SOM) neurons, which can directly inhibit PAG neurons, and some of which innervate both the PAG and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Notably, fear conditioning potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission onto these long-range projection CeL neurons. Thus, our study identifies a subpopulation of SOMCeL neurons that may contribute to fear learning and regulate fear expression independent of CeM.[@penzo_2014]

The central amygdala (CeL) is composed of distinct types of GABA-producing inhibitory neurons (  Cassell and Gray, 1989  ;  Cassell et al., 1999  ;  Ehrlich et al., 2009  ;  Haubensak et al., 2010  ), among which the somatostatin-positive (SOM) neurons are a major population (  Cassell and Gray, 1989  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). These are intermingled with SOMcells that are predominantly protein kinase C--expressing (PKC-) neurons (  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). SOMneurons and PKC-neurons collectively constitute  90% of the entire CeL population, and the two cell types are mutually inhibitory (  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ). We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).

## CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a limbic hub involved in autonomic regulation, emotion, and motivated behavior, and has been strongly implicated in opioid dependence (Koob, 2009a; Upadhyay et al., 2010). 

### Cell-specific effects on membrane properties

Similar cell-type-specificity is present during fear conditioning.
Specifically, in the CeL, SOM- and PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-positive neurons account for approximately 90% of whole neuronal population.<!--citations-->
During fear conditioning, excitatory synapses onto SOM-expressing neurons are being strengthened, whereas those onto PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons are being weakened [@li_2013a].<!--We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOM+ neurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).-->
Moreover, when the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto SOM-expressing neurons is prevented, the fear memory formation is impaired, illustrating experience-dependent synaptic potentiation onto SOM-positive neurons in the CeL as a critical component of fear circuitry. <!--Notably, preventing the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons is associated with impaired fear memory formation, and activation of SOMneurons is necessary for fear memory recall and sufficient to drive fear responses.These observations indicate that experience-dependent synaptic potentiation onto SOMCeL neurons stores fear memories and enables the expression of conditioned fear responses (  Li et al., 2013  ).-->
<!--The CeL presumably gates fear expression by tonically inhibiting medial subdivision of the central amygdala (CeM), the major amygdala output to downstream fear effectors that control defensive responses (  LeDoux et al., 1988  ;  Johansen et al., 2011  ). -->

In Late-Firing, CX3CL1 does not impact the parameters examined, suggesting that this chemokine selectively targets Regular-Spiking in the CeL. 

Those neurons were shown to extensively inhibit PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons within the CeL, they do not 
Interestingly, although the SOMCeL neurons can inhibit locally within CeL, strongly inhibiting SOMneurons, they neither send noticeable projections to the CeM nor inhibit CeM neurons (  Li et al., 2013  ). 
In sharp contrast, the PKC-expressing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons (  Haubensak et al., 2010  ;  Li et al., 2013  ).

These findings suggest that activation of SOMneurons promotes fear expression, at least in part, by inhibiting PKC-(SOM) neurons, thereby disinhibiting CeM. They also suggest that the fear conditioning-induced synaptic modifications in CeL likely underlie the changes in cell firing in CeL and CeM during fear conditioning (  Ciocchi et al., 2010  ;  Duvarci et al., 2011  ). 

CX3CL1 presented also cell-specific actions in the DRN, acting only on serotoninergic neurons [@heinisch_2009].

### Paralleled by decreased frequency of sIPSC onto Late-Firing neurons

IS might be seen often in Vip cells as a result of their high input resistance, which increases the possibility that noise, an intrinsic subthreshold oscillation, or a small synaptic input will produce sufficient depolarization to reach spike threshold. <!-- but we have decreased input resistance, BUT depolarized...-->

This influence can be assumed to increase reciprocal interactions between CElon and CEloff pathways, thereby boosting the medial CE (CEm) output pathway and contributing to the anxiogenic-like action of SP in the amygdala.

In rats subjected to restraint stress, acute application of corticotropin releasing factor significantly increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the CeA (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014).

Rats subjected to repeated corticosterone administration showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior, examined using the open field test. The behavioral effects caused by corticosterone injections may because of increased expression of c-Fos in the LA and CeA nuclei of the amygdala and decreased GABAA a -2 subunit density in the CeA of these rats (Skórzewska et al., 2015). These findings are consistent with those of another study (Lussier et al., 2013). Liu et al. (2014) suggested that a lasting loss of tonic but not phasic GABAA receptor currents severely contributes to the prolonged amygdala disinhibition observed after chronic stress.


 In fact, GABAergic control of the amygdala is mostly relevant to anxiety. Some animal researches have shown that administration of corticosterone into the CeA can induce anxiety-like behavior. This animal model imitate the depressed effect of chronic stress on GABAergic tonic inhibition in LA (Myers et al., 2005). There are also some studies that show an association between the amygdala’s GABA interneuronal network and alcohol addiction (Nie et al., 2004, 2009; Bajo et al., 2008). 

We would expect higher proportion of co-localization between SOM-positive and CX3CR1-expressing neurons.

A handful of studies have utilized CX3CR1-deficient mice to explore the role of this receptor in chronic stress, regarding its regulation by stress (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017), its importance for microglial morphological ramification and phagocytosis (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017), and its beneficial versus detrimental role in brain and behavioral responses to physio-pathological (Gunner et al., 2019; Lowery et al., 2017; Schecter et al., 2017) or psychosocial stressors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Winkler et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2013).
Among these, studies have showed that CX3CR1 rescued chronic stress-induced increase in microglial phagocytosis (Milior et al., 2016) and decrease in hippocampal long-term potentiation (Milior et al., 2016), while improving neurogenesis and short-term memory (Rimmerman et al., 2017).
CX3CR1-deficiency caused social withdrawal and increased repetitive behavior (Zhan et al., 2014), as well as increased fear acquisition and reinstatement (Schubert et al., 2018), implicating a beneficial function of CX3CR1 for the stressed brain. 
However, other studies showed that CX3CR1-deficient mice were resistant to chronic stress-induced depressive-like and anxiety behaviors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2017), jointly implying a detrimental role of CX3CR1 in psychiatric disorders. [@paiirainen_2021]


We also observed the regional heterogeneity of microglia and its potential importance for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders (Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020; Xuan et al., 2019). [@paiirainen_2021]

 Interestingly, the subcellularlocalization profile of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are distinct.CX3CL1 localizes as cell-filled puncta whereas its receptorlocalizes in a perinuclear pattern within neurons. This fur-ther suggests synthesis, as well as potential storage andrelease, of CX3CL1 in 5-HT neurons. In contrast, CX3CR1may require cellular activation for receptor mobilization tothe cellular membrane in order for CX3CL1-CX3CR1 in-teraction to occur. [@heinisch_2009]

Increased anxiety and depression, accompanied by impaired sociability are considered hallmarks of abnormal stress-related neuropsychiatric  manifestations  in  both  rodents  and  humans (Brodkin, 2007; Ma et al., 2015; Theoharides et al., 2016).  

Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that CX3CR1 may not be universally important for all types of physiological adaptations, as indicated by its recently reported dispensability in  light  deprivation-induced  visual  cortex  plasticity  (Lowery et al., 2017; Schecter et al., 2017).

Other chemokines, such as MCP1, are recently found to be involved in descending facilitation of neuropathic pain. Neutralizing CCL2 with an anti-CCL2 antibody into the rostral ventromedial medulla after spinal nerve ligation significantly attenuated the established thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity

This synaptic potentiation is expressed as an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in fear-conditioned mice compared with control mice. Whereas higher mEPSC frequency may reflect an increase in either presynaptic release probability or the number of active synapses, a change in mEPSC amplitude usually indicates a postsynaptic effect (  Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008  ;  Li et al., 2013  ).

The encoding, consolidation and retrieval of memories is a multifaceted process that depends strongly on the optimal level of arousal but high levels of arousal may trigger anxiety, which negatively impacts the memory processing by the brain.

The modulation of animal behavior by chemokines is channeled through the activation of the dopaminergic and catecholaminergic system in several brain regions. citations

We speculate that the activation of A3Risan event downstream of the release of ADO from astrocytes upon CXCL16 treatment; alternatively, also in light of the emerging data on the determinant role of ADO in cytokine neuroprotection (Biber et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2010; Moidunny et al., 2010), it can be hypothesized that ADO acts as a synergistic modulator that senses neuronal environment and, together with specific triggering events driven from single cell types, concurs to neuroprotection acting on specific ARs. However, we cannot exclude that other soluble factors might represent key mediators of CXCL16 neuroprotection, since impairing CCL2 activity dramatically reduces, but did not fully abolish, the ability of the chemokine to preserve neurons. Together these data demonstrate that CXCL16 is constitutively expressed in CNS and that, upon pathological conditions, it is able to reduce neuronal cell death through a mechanism that requires cross talk between astrocytes and neurons, representing an example of how chemokine-induced chemokine-release from astrocytes might be a phenomenon that drives beneficial effects.


Although CX3CL1 may induce monocytic infiltrates during CNS inflammation (Chapman et al., 2000), it ap-pears to exert an overall neuroprotective action.Mizuno etal. (2003)reported CX3CL1-mediated inhibition both ofneuronal apoptosis and of activated microglial nitric oxide,IL-6, and TNF-production. Interestingly, CX3CL1 is alsoup-regulated in HIV encephalitis brain tissue, indicatingthat its induction may be in response to chronic activationof the neurotoxic glutamate-mediated excitatory neuro-transmission by HIV neurotoxins platelet-activating factorand Tat (Tong et al., 2000). In fact, CX3CL1 is a reportedinhibitor of glutamate synaptic activity in the hippocampusunder basal conditions (Bertollini et al., 2006). The abilityof CX3CL1 to modulate glutamate function appears to bethe mechanism involved in its neuroprotective actions, andit provides support for a chemokine-neuromodulatory rolein the CNS (Adler and Rogers, 2005; Adler et al., 2006;Callewaere et al., 2007; Guyon and Nahon, 2007).
