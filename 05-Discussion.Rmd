# Discussion

the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connec- tions formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern.

Here, we report rapid modulatory effects of CX3CL1 on neuronal events in hippocampal tissue. Our data does not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons and we cannot discount the possibility that the effects we see on LTP and calcium influx in neuronal cell types happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglial cell types. If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought. The evidence from rats that CX3CR1 is expressed on hippocampal neuron allows the possibility that, as is the case for CX3CL1-mediated regulation of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal Raphe, glutamatergic neuron-derived CX3CL1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the hippocampus during periods of synaptic plasticity to regulate glutamate-mediated neurotransmission tone.-Sheridan2014

Generally, the increase in sIPSC or sEPSC frequency enhanced the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the effect of minocycline on SG neurons is mainly of a presynaptic origin rather than a postsynaptic origin

Neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic
terminal is triggered by a Na+ channel-dependent action potential, a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the somatodendritic region, and presynaptic ligand- gated channel activation. For example, an endogenous peptide antisecretory factor reduced the frequency of sIPSCs, but not mIPSCs, in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Strandberg et al., 2014). Likewise, if an increase in sIPSC frequency is triggered by a Na+ channel- dependent action potential, then the Na+ channel blocker TTX should block the effect of minocycline. In contrast, the increase in mIPSC frequency induced by minocycline was not blocked by bath application of TTX. It has been demonstrated that Na+ channels, which account for action potential propagation expressed in lamina I/II of the spinal cord, are entirely TTX-sensitive (Hildebrand et al., 2011). Therefore, our results together with the pub- lished literature suggest that a Na+ channel-dependent action potential is not involved in the effect of minocycline on inhibitory transmission. It remains unclear whether a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the soma- todendritic region contributes to minocycline response. We next investigated whether glutamate receptor- mediated sEPSCs are involved in the increase in GABA and glycine release. Our data show that the effect of minocycline under the treatment with CNQX and APV was the same as with TTX. Therefore, it is possible that the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmitter release is due to presynaptic ligand-gated channel activation. The spontaneous synaptic neurotransmitter release of dorsal horn neurons relies critically on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (Bourinet et al., 2014).- Peng2016

Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation. However, minocycline also has been reported to directly affect neurons.32,49,50 Multiple lines of evidencehave shown the role of minocycline in protecting neuronsfrom apoptosis via inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.30–32,51,52Our observation of increased neuronal p38 MAPK activityin the CeA raises the possibility that minocycline could haveinhibited visceral hypersensitivity through an attenuation ofneuronal apoptosis via a direct inhibition of p38 MAPK ac-tivity. Therefore, we applied apoptosis analysis in WAS andSHAM animals. - Yuan2020

These features are concordant with an increased number of synapses, an interpretation supported by our Golgi stains where we found a greater density of dendritic spines in EAE mice. A parallel increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and change in AMPAR dynamics is also consistent with an increase in the number of mature functional synapses and dendritic spines in response to EAE induction (Danglot et al., 2012; Hanse et al., 2013). **It is thought that new spines are associated with more AMPARs compared with NMDA receptors (Zito et al., 2009).** The AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).- Acharjee2018b


The present data are not sufficient to explain the difference we observed in LTD suppression during mouse development. It could be related to changes in chemokine receptor density, such as those described in terminally  differentiated  human  neurons  in   comparison  with  the  undifferentiated  precursors   Hesselgesser  et  al., . 1997 ,  though PN sensitivity   estimated with fluorescence .. determinations   to chemokines in adult   2-month old   and . young   2-week old   mice was comparable - Giovanelli_1999

# GABA

Three types of GABA receptors, two ligand-gated channels, GABAAand GABAC, and one metabotropic, GABAB, have been described to date (Chebib and Johnston 1999). The selective GABAAantagonist bicuculline fully abolished the GABA response in our system, indicating that it was mediated through GABAAionotropic receptors. As expected from an ionotropic response, the effect of GABA was fasttriggered (100 ms) in our model. Interestingly, MCP1/CCL2 inhibition of the GABA response was observed following concomitant application of the chemokine and the neurotransmitter, indicating that it took less than 100 ms for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. Such a fast event suggests that the classical G protein-mediated signalling cascades associated with GPCR activation were not operated by MCP1/CCL2. This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that GTP was not required in the intracellular medium for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. One possible explanation that might account for such a fast GTPindependent MCP1/CCL2 effect, as observed here, might be that CCR2 activation by its agonist ligand resulted in an inhibition of GABAAreceptor activity through direct receptor–receptor interactions. There are some examples in the literature of such interactions between GPCRs and ionotropic receptors (Liu et al . 2000; Lee et al . 2002; Fiorentini et al . 2003). Further studies that combine biochemical, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches are needed to test this intriguing hypothesis. GABA plays a major role in spinal cord physiology as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). One classical function exerted by GABA is its participation in the inhibitory modulation of somatosensory transmission, including nociception (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). In particular, the blockade of spinal GABAAreceptors has been shown to cause hyperalgesia and lead to tactile allodynia in the rat (Malan et al . 2002). This consideration might shed some light on the physiological relevance of the present findings. Indeed, a sizeable number of studies reporting the facilitation of either inflammatory or neuropathic pain by chemokines is now available (Boddeke 2001). Thus, numerous chemokines, including MCP-1/CCL2, have been shown to elicit transient Ca2+currents in dorsal root ganglion neurones (Oh et al . 2001). Moreover, MCP-1/ CCL2 and other chemokines have been shown to crossdesensitize opioid receptors in both dorsal root ganglion and periaqueducal grey matter neurones (Szabo et al . 2002; Zhang et al . 2004). More to the point, MCP-1/CCL2 has been shown to induce mechanical allodynia after intrathecal administration (Tanaka et al . 2004), acting in this regard like a GABAAreceptor antagonist (Malan et al . 2002). Finally, the  involvement  of  MCP-1/CCL2  in  pain  is  strongly supported by the recent observation that mice lacking the CCR2 receptor were markedly less sensitive to noxious stimuli in models of neuropathic pain (Abbadie et al . 2003). It is therefore tempting to propose that the potent inhibition of GABA-induced activation of GABAAreceptors by MCP1/ CCL2, as reported here, might be one of the mechanisms by which the chemokine and its receptor, CCR2, facilitate nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level. In accordance with this hypothesis, our autoradiographic results showed a high density of [125I]MCP-1/CCL2 binding sites in areas I–IV of the dorsal horn and in the central cervical nucleus in the cervical cord, two regions known to receive somatosensory input from sensory neurones. As mentioned above, GABA is a wide-spectrum inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and, consequently, its actions spread well beyond the control of pain. It is also implicated in the modulation of other somatosensory spinal inputs and in the membrane excitability of ventral horn motoneurones (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). Our immunolabelling data indicate that CCR2 is constitutively expressed by a majority of spinal neurones. It is therefore likely that MCP-1/CCL2 could act on other neuronal spinal networks to attenuate GABA inhibitory actions in both physiological and pathological situations.

Although DA release and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (cultures vs. slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CXCL12 in both systems.

#### NMDA

NMDARs  are  versatile  receptors  modulating  physiological  and pathological activities in the nervous system. They are involved in development, synapse maturation, synaptic transmission and plasticity   processes,   and   their   dysfunction   has   been   implicated  in  several  neurodegenerative  diseases  and  mood  disorders  (Malenka  and  Bear,  2004;  Hardingham  and  Bading,  2010; Zhou  and  Sheng,  2013;  Ghasemi  et  al.,  2014).  NMDAR  stimulation may  induce  neuronal  death  (Choi,  1987;  Choi  et  al., 1988;  Tymianski  et  al.,  1993)  or  protection,  also  through  preconditioning   (Grabb   and   Choi,   1999;   Navon   et   al.,   2012). @lauro_2014

#### adenosine

Adenosine is a metabolite that acts through different receptor subtypes (Jacobson and Gao, 2006); among them A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we  previously  demonstrated  that  CX3CL1  triggers  the  release of  adenosine  from  neuronal  and  microglial  cells  (Lauro  et  al., 2008,  2010). 
Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports de scribe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). [@rosito_2012]

In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).

Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. [@cunha_2001]


### cx3cl1

We have previously shown that another transmembrane chemokine, CX3CL1, in duces protection of hippocampal neurons from Glu-induced excitotoxicity with a mechanism mediated by microglia (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). <!-- opposite -->
the inhibition of microglia activation selectively  prevented  CX3CL1-induced neuroprotection, while CXCL16 was still able to rescue neurons from cell death (Fig. 4 A , n  4–5; p  0.05) indicating that microglia activation is not required for CXCL16-mediated neuroprotection.
