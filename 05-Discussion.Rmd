# Discussion

Chemokines are a class of small immune proteins emerging as neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication.<!-- Chemokines (chemotaxic cytokines) are a family of small proteins which play a prominent role in the trafficking of immune cells and in the orchestration of inflammatory responses--><!-- Indeed, chemokines appear to play several important roles in neuronal development and in the function of the mature nervous system (Tran and Miller 2003).Chemokine receptors are expressed by diverse populations of neurons and glia.-->
Few of them, such as CX3CL1 and CXCL12, are particularly important in this regard, as they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they were shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, as well as the behavioral level [@sowa_2021; @trettel_2020].<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors.
As the receptors, CXCR4 and CX3CR1, are relatively densely present in the amygdala, the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders, the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored.
Moreover, since distinct nuclei of the amygdala play different roles in ...<!--lepiej napisać o różnicach-->, it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 trigger different electrophysiological responses in those regions.
To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA).
Moreover, considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication, the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of observed effects.<!--???-->
Performing all electrophysiological experiments using acute brain slices with microglial inhibitor and astrocytic toxin also allowed for dissecting local neuro-glial cross-talk in these nuclei of the amygdala.<!-- Since all the experiments presented in here were performed using acute brain slices, it cannot be excluded that observed effects might be also mediated by glial cells. analogous -->

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala {#discusscx3cl1bla}

<!--Despite relatively high levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the amygdala and the involvement of this chemokine in anxiety-related behavior, the precise role of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway in the amygdala is still unknown. lepiej napisać -->
This dissertation provides evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair: (i) reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing their threshold current, (ii) significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as (iii) impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA synapses. 
These effects were mediated by the CX3CL1 only receptor, CX3CR1, and probably by microglia.
In addition, in primary neuronal cultures from the amygdala, incubation with CX3CL1 induced an immature-like phenotype of dendritic spines reflected as a decreased ratio of dendritic head to length.<!-- Application of CX3CL1 on acute brain slices led to the following electrophysiological effects: (1) depression of principal cell's excitability, (2) reduction of GABAergic transmission, manifested as a decreased median frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents, (3) the impairment in the long-term potentiation.-->

Principal cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are well-known to converge information about both conditional and unconditional stimuli.
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, @nabavi_2014).
Moreover, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.
Accordingly, plasticity at synapses onto principal cells in this region is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and storage of new fear memories.
Hence, their activity is tightly regulated by a broad array of factors, including a GABAergic system or different types of neuromodulators.<!-- lepiej napisać /// external signals? External signals such as hormones and modulatory neurotransmitters that affect cellular excitability or signalling in biochemical pathways can exert a profound influence on the degree of synaptic plasticity induced by a particular stimulus protocol-->
 
Here, the reduced excitability was demonstrated after CX3CL1 treatment, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting action potentials.
Thus, the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the principal cells' firing may have significant consequences on BLA physiology.<!--The CX3CL1–induced decrease in excitability of BLA principal cells manifested as an increase in threshold current, together with an broadening of action potentials,tutaj broadining statistically significant in 2nM, but only tendency in 5nM, w miarę blokowane, najsłabiej przez AZD8797... suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. @sun_2006--><!--One of the main effects induced by CX3CL1 in the BLA is a decreased principal cell's excitability ( Figures \@ref(fig:)--><!--CX3CL1 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability (Figures \@ref(fig:))--><!-- Both LPS injection and CCL2 perfusion onto hippocampal slices increased total neuronal excitability ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G, and 5H), which has contributions from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, as well as the neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties. Consistent with the observed increase in excitatory synaptic transmission and lack of change in inhibitory synaptic transmission ( Figures 5 E, 5F, S7 C, and S7D), the effects of CCL2 were blocked by the AMPA receptor inhibitor NBQX, but not the GABAAreceptor inhibitor gabazine ( Figures S7 E–S7H). CCL2 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability ( Figures S7 I and S7J).--><!--An enhancement of neuronal excitability in the absence of membrane depolarization was previously described in dissociated DRG neurons during exposure to PGE2, which suppresses the sustained K^+^ current (Nicol et al. 1997)--><!--The MCP-1–induced reduction in rheobase, together with an increase in spike frequency and a broadening of action potentials, suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. analogous-->
This effect was dependent on the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1.<!--further verifying? confirming specificity? -->
To block this receptor, two approaches were used. 
Although pre-incubating slices with an antibody against CX3CL1 abolished the observed effect, a small portion of neurons still remained responsive to CX3CL1. 
This may be due to the limited tissue penetration of antibodies, estimated around 50`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m, while slices used for this study were 300`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`m thick. 
Thus another approach was used by employing the pharmacological inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797.
The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures [@lannes_2019]<!--hamster, 10uM--> as well as *in vivo* administered both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) [@ho_2020a] and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model [@chen_2020].
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")` [@baxter_2021; @ridderstadwollberg_2014], was also effective during the experiments presented here.
Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not affect any measured electrophysiological parameters.
Thus, in the remaining experiments, the10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")` was applied.<!--, since at this concentration electrophysiological effects triggered by CX3CL1 were efficiently prevented.-->
<!--However, this CX3CR1 inhibitor did not change the expression level of the CX3CR1 protein but enhanced the expression level of the CX3CL1 protein. AZD8797 is a non-competitive inhibitor for CX3CR1. The above result suggests that it has no influence on the CX3CR1 protein itself except for affecting the activation of its downstream signaling pathway. More intriguingly, AZD8797 increases the expression level of CX3CL1, indicating that there is a feedback loop, probably a compensatory effect after blocking the signaling pathway, which has been pointed out previously but is yet to be further defined [@cederblad_2016]. - [@chen_2020].-->

The presented CX3CL1-mediated impairment in the LTP is consistent with many previous studies showing CX3CL1-induced inhibition of LTP or mimicking LTD in the hippocampus [@bertollini_2006; @maggi_2009; @ragozzino_2006; @sheridan_2014], without affecting paired-pulse ratio [@bertollini_2006; @ragozzino_2006; @sheridan_2014].<!-- In PPF (at multiple synapses), the second pair of stimuli separated by a few tens of milliseconds produces a larger synaptic response than the first, owing to the transient elevation of Ca2^+^ in terminal boutons produced by the second stimulus summing with the residual Ca2^+^ produced by the first stimulus, and increasing the probability of transmitter release. Since probability of transmitter release cannot exceed 1, the PPF ratio tends to decrease as probability of release increases (Bliss & Collingridge, 2013). Therefore, in the LA the glutamate release in response to paired pulse stimulation seems to be reduced in TPH2− / −mice. Besides differences in release probability differences in PPF in the amygdala and the hippocampus, -->
PPR, a measure of short-term synaptic plasticity, is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the second response to that of the first, which depends on the probability of vesicular release at the synapse.
Thus, the unaffected PPR suggests a similar release probability of glutamate and, therefore, a postsynaptic mechanism of CX3CL1 action.
Consistently, in this study, a CX3CL1-mediated increase in the threshold current was observed, leading to a reduction of principal cells' firing.

Many lines of evidence show neuroprotective and beneficial actions of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.
For instance, the expression of CX3CL1 is upregulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission, such as after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus or ischemia, where it is consistently shown to reduce neurotoxicity [@cipriani_2011; @limatola_2005; @tarozzo_2002; @tong_2000; @yeo_2011].<!--CX3CL1 has been reportedly up-regulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission where the chemokine is clearly protective against excitotoxic cell death (Tong et al., 2000; Tarozzo et al., 2002; Limatola et al., 2005; Cipriani et al., 2011; Briones et al., 2014).Moreover, both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, have been shown to be up-regulated in hippocampal neurons after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Yeo et al., 2011), a condition characterized by excessive glutamatergic excitation. // with reduction of glutamate-induced and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity [@deiva_2004; @limatola_2005]. // On the other hand, in the ischemic model, the CX3CL1 i.c.v. injection was shown, again with the involvement of A~1~Rs, to induce neuroprotective effects, such as the reduction of a lesion volume and neurological deficits [@cipriani_2011].-->
Its beneficial actions were also reported in neurodegenerative models, where it was shown to rescue motor coordination [@morganti_2012] or reduce Tau-pathology [@finneran_2019].<!-- A role for endogenous CX3CL1 in the attenuation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype was also reported in a mouse model of Tauopathy ( Lastres-Becker et al., 2014 ).Recent data show that only the over-expression of a specific cleavage variant of the soluble CX3CL1 reduced Tau-pathology ( Finneran and Nash, 2019 ). -->
<!-- In a pMCAO rat model, i.c.v. injection of soluble CX3CL1, 30 min after ischemia, has long lasting protective effects, reducing lesion volume and neurological deficits, again with the involvement of active A1Rs ( Cipriani et al., 2011).-->
Moreover, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents with a mechanism that involves increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit [@lauro_2008; @limatola_2005; @meucci_1998; @ragozzino_2006], a hallmark of the long-term depression (LTD).<!-- For example, CX3CL1 has been shown to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and post-synaptic glutamate currents (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005).-Sheridan2014 // These effects are probably a result of a PKA-related phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845 [@ragozzino_2006]. -->
Thus, this predominantly inhibitory role is suggested<!--może po prostu suggested?--> to be a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010; @sheridan_2014].<!--zmienić bardziej /// Overall, previous studies indicate apredominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, perhaps as a compo-nent of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006;Turrigiano, 2008; Piccinin et al., 2010). -->
Importantly, in the BLA, many disorders are linked with the increased excitability of pyramidal-like cells along with the elevated magnitude of LTP.<!--citations-->
Indeed, blocking LTP with NMDA receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to facilitate extinction ((Falls et al, 1992; Vianna et al, 2001; Santini et al, 2004; Sotres-Bayon et al, 2007, (Walker and Davis, 2002; Yang and Lu, 2005)).<!--citations i może bardziej zmienić--><!--For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity that mediates the acquisition and storage of new fear memories, particularly in the lateral nuclei of the amygdala. Treatments that block LTP, such as NMDA receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors, disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear (Falls et al, 1992; Vianna et al, 2001; Santini et al, 2004; Sotres-Bayon et al, 2007). Conversely, drugs that promote LTP can facilitate extinction (Walker and Davis, 2002; Yang and Lu, 2005). // Moreover, and adult-like LTP of amygdala afferents emerges during infancy when the amygdala begins to contribute to fear learning (Thompson et al. 2008).-->
<!-- więcej zaburzeń -->
Therefore, considering its well-documented neuroprotective role in other brain structures, the reduced activity of PCs along with impaired LTP in the BLA may suggest the anxiolytic actions of CX3CL1. 

<!--Consistently, CX3CL1 application did not significantly affect the frequency of excitatory synaptic currents. 
However, contrary to studies and present LTP data, the amplitude of these events also remained unchanged following CX3CL1 application.
Further experimentation is required to clarify whether despite impaired synaptic plasticity and reduced frequency of neurons, changes in glutamatergic transmission are not detectible.
 wyjaśneinei? It is suggested that maybe due to regional differences-->

Unlike what is observed in the hippocampus, this study did not find any effect on excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA by CX3CL1.<!--jakoś lepiej to napisać?-->
<!-- First of all, in some studies a much higher dose was used than here (100nM vs. 2-5nM; @meucci_1998, @ragozzino_2006), reaching levels during inflammatory conditions. 
This raises the possibility that the postsynaptic CX3CL1/CX3CR1-dependent mechanism leading to activation of pro-survival pathways requires higher concentrations.At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999;Meucci et al., 2000;Cambienet al., 2001;Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009;Lyons et al.,2009).// For example, CX3CR1 dose-dependently stimulates calcium mobilization in CX3CR1-expressing cells with an EC50 of 2 nM (Imai et al., 1997). CX3CL1 also dose-dependently reduces glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons with an EC50 of 0.7 nM (Limatola et al., 2005). Finally, CX3CL1 dose-dependently inhibits field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (Bertollini et al., 2006) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude (Ragozzino et al., 2006) in hippocampal neurons with an EC50 of 0.7 and 1.0 nM, respectively.// At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000; Cambien et al., 2001; Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2009) While previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 causes an increase in intracellular calcium in neurons and other cell types (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Ragozzino et al., 2006) this effect of CX3CL1 becomes apparent at concentrations of 25 nM and higher (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004), well above the levels we investigated here and we observed no such increase in intracellular calcium. At a concentration of 2 nM, in both neurons and non-neurons, CX3CL1 pre-incubation suppressed glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium levels. These data are in good agreement with previous findings of a protective effect of inflammatory levels of CX3CL1 against glutamate excitotoxicity and glutamate NMDA receptor activation, in particular (Meucci et al., 1998; Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005), although, unlike the current work, the latter effect was linked to increased intracellular calcium (Ragozzino et al., 2006). Calcium oscillations in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells are important for cellular growth, migration and synaptic structural refinement (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Komuro and Rakic, 1998; Spitzer et al., 2000). Thus, the dampening of such signaling by CX3CL1 is suggestive of a role in stability of network connectivity and activity. Overall, the current data along with information in the published literature reveal that a role for CX3CL1 in control of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission during excitotoxic events can be extended to situations of synaptic plasticity required for normal functions such as memory formation.--><!--This is unlikely, as the CX3CL1-induced reduction of neurotoxicity, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials or evoked excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude are dose-dependent with EC50 between 0.7-1 nM [@bertollini_2006; @limatola_2005; @ragozzino_2006].
On the other hand, while CX3CL1 at the dose of 25nM and higher was reported to increase intracellular calcium levels in neurons and other cell types [@deiva_2004; @oh_2002; @ragozzino_2006], both neuronal and non-neuronal cells reacted with suppression of intracellular calcium levels following the concentration of 2nM [@sheridan_2014]./// many studies using similar concentrations to those reported in this dissertation [@bertollini_2006; @lauro_2008; @maggi_2009; @maggi_2011; @piccinin_2010; @scianni_2013] demonstrated that CX3CL1 reduce glutamatergic transmission *via* the involvement of a glial component.-->
These regional differences between hippocampus and amygdala may be linked to the fact that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, but rather its action is mediated by adenosine, released from microglia upon CX3CR1 receptor activation [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010].
Adenosine is a cellular metabolite that acts through four different G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes (A~1~R, A~2A~R, A~2B~R, and A~3~R; @verkhratsky_2009), behaving as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level [@boison_2010; @cunha_2001; @ribeiro_2010].<!-- Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. [@cunha_2001]--><!-- In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).-->
Notably, depending on the receptor activation, adenosine exerts opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus [@piccinin_2010].<!-- koniecznie lepiej napisać....// Among them, A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we previously demonstrated that CX3CL1 triggers the release of adenosine from neuronal and microglial cells (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). This CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R and, to the lesser extent, A~1~R, in the hippocampus [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]. Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. // Of note, sole adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure . // Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports describe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). [@rosito_2012]-->
<!-- This notion is further supported by the fact that -- powiązać to jakoś z microglejem? --><!-- The concept that ADO acts as an endogenous modulator able to exert neuroprotective effects through to the control of glutamatergic transmission is well established (Fredholm et al., 2005). In addition, itsroleinmodulationofcellmetabolism(Cunha,2001),neuron-glia communication (Boison et al., 2010), and the tuning of growth factor signaling (Gomes et al., 2011) is becoming evident. Indeed, we and others have recently shown that the chemokine CX3CL1 and the cytokines IL-6 and OSM are able to drive neuroprotection only in the presence of functional A1R (Biber et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2010; Moidunny et al., 2010; Cipriani et al., 2011). In particular, IL-6 and OSM potentiate the expression and the function of neuronal A1R and therefore the ADO effects on neurotransmission and neu roprotection (Moidunny et al., 2010); on the other hand, CX3CL1 neuroprotection is due to ADO release from microglia, activation of A1R, and, possibly, the subsequent release of glial-soluble factors that contribute to neuroprotection (Lauro et al., 2010). In contrast, in the present work we found that CXCL16 exerts neuroprotection against Glu insult only in the presence of functional A3R, the inactivation of all of the other ARs being unable to limit the CXCL16 effect. In rodents, among ARs, A3R has the lower affinity for ADO (Jacobson et al., 1995) and is expressed at low levels in the brain (Ji et al., 1994), including the hippocampus (Dunwiddie et al., 1997; Macek et al., 1998) and the cerebral cortex (Brand et al., 2001). The ability of A3R to contribute to neuroprotection is controversial: in vivo studies suggest that differences in timing of intraperitoneal A3R agonist admin istration may alter the outcome of ischemic brain injury (Von Lubitz et al., 1995, 2001). In vitro studies showed that, depending on brief or prolonged periods of ischemia, A3R mediates effects on neurotrans mission that can shift from protection to injury (Pugliese et al., 2007). In the present study we report data supporting the hypothesis that A3R drives neuroprotective effects, in agreement with the find ing that upon repeated episodes of hypoxia, A3R / mice have a wider neurodegeneration compared with wt (Fedorova et al., 2003), and that central administration of selective A3R agonist reduces isch emic brain injury in mice (Chen et al., 2006). -->
Specifically, further evidence indicated that CX3CL1-induced adenosine action *via* A~1~R and A~3~R receptor led to decreased glutamatergic transmission [@lauro_2008, @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010], whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-triggered increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC), observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. <!--This CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R, and to the lesser extend A~1~R[@lauro_2008, @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]./// Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, -->
Moreover, @scianni_2013 demonstrated that CX3CL1 modulates the function of another glutamate receptor, NMDA , by releasing D-serine from glial cells and activating the A~2A~R subtype.<!-- CX3CL1-mediated neuroprotection and neuromodulation may also require the activity of adenosine-type 2 a receptors (A2ARs). --><!-- Scianni et al. (2013) demonstrated that CX3CL1 modulates the NMDA glutamate receptor function and that this effect involves the release of D-serine from glial cells, and the activity of A2AR subtype. // CX3CL1 was also shown to trigger D-serine, a NMDAR co-agonist, release from glial cells, and potentiate NMDAR function in an A~2A~- and D-serine-dependent manner, which was driven by microglial cells [@scianni_2013].// Altogether these data describe a mechanism by which CX3CL1, via A2AR and D-serine, and likely modulating synaptic NR2A/NMDARs, induced CREB phosphorylation, upregulation and release of BDNF, resulting in neuroprotection and neuromodulation ( Lauro et al., 2015). -->
<!--Therefore, the CX3CL1-induced adenosine release may affect glutamatergic neurotransmission by a mechanism involving a combination of three different AR subtypes and both glutamatergic receptors. Nevertheless, the opposite effects of CX3CL1 on AMPAR and NMDAR functions are nicely correlated with the difference between A~3~R/A~1~R and A~2A~R receptors.Moreover, the depressed glutamatergic transmission following CX3CL1 and adenosine application corresponds with results from studies of synaptic plasticity (see: Section \@ref(LTP)). -->
Thus, these studies raise the possibility that CX3CL1 also induces the release of adenosine in the BLA, which in turn, is a downstream molecule of the observed electrophysiological effects.
Consistent with this idea, both A~1~R and A~2A~R receptors were documented to modulate the excitatory AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission and LTP [@simes_2016; @rau_2014; @rau_2015] similarly to the hippocampus.<!-- These findings are suggestive of the possible mediation of CX3CL1-induced effects by adenosine. // A1R activation inhibits spontaneous and evoked AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission,13 while A2AR increase the firing rate of BLA pyramidal neurons14 and facilitate long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) of LA population spikes, evoked by stimulating external mainly cortical afferents.15-->
Importantly, while the study documented the activation of A~2A~R elevated the amplitude of NMDA currents in the hippocampus [@dias_2012], decreased NMDA-EPSCs were observed following the bath-application of A~2A~R agonists in the amygdala.
This opposing action of adenosine between these two regions on the excitatory synaptic transmission might account for the observed differences in glutamatergic currents observed after CX3CL1 treatment.

Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission from cell to cell possibly<!--might?--> depends upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?-->
Several microscopic analyses illustrated that principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA<!-- sprawdzić and (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses.<!--citations-->
Mounting evidence shows that <!--in addition to their dendritic and somatic differences in morphology-->BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies, including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons [@mcdonald_2001; @muller_2003; @muller_2005; @muller_2006; @muller_2007].
While axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; @mcdonald_2001, @muller_2005, @muller_2006), somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons [@muller_2007].
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, GABAergic synapses from SOM-expressing neurons influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
<!--Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentialsdirectly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in , dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: @tremblay_2016). -->
As whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study were made from the soma,and the potassium-based intrapipette solution was used, excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites needed to travel more distance and can be decreased by GABAergic synapses.
Hence, they might not be detected from baseline noise.<!--Given that the the glutamatergic synapses are located on the distal parts of principal cells' dendrites, it is likely that interneurons contacting synapses mainly on distal dendritic parts might decrease the excitatory inputs. -->
Noting that cesium blocks potassium currents, additional experiments using cesium-based intrapipette solution might resolve whether CX3CL1 mediate changes contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites [@williams_2008].<!-- Cesium reduces filtering of the synaptic currents arising from distal parts of the dendrite by blocking the potassium current, and changes in EPSC frequency seen only with cesium internal suggested that most of the changes were contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites.--><!-- the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connections formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern. bardziej o ITCs and CeA, ale ładne słownictwo-->
<!--However, this scenario is unlikely, as proportions of neuronal reactions were the same between CX3CL1(2nM) application and CX3CL1(2nM) application with additional inhibition of GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ channels (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).-->

In addition, the lack of changes in the paired-pulse ratio of field EPSP, together with inconclusive changes in the frequency of sEPSC, implies postsynaptic actions of CX3CL1.
Intriguingly, the suppression of principal cells' firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance (see Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall1) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1membraneappendix)).<!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->

As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduction of pyramidal-like neurons' firing is the regulation by a GABAergic inhibitory system.
Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the CNS is mediated by the GABA~A~ receptor, a heteropentameric chloride permeable, GABA-gated member of ligand-gated ion channels, whereas slow inhibitory synaptic transmission is associated with GABA~B~ receptor.<!--więcej o nich-->
Indeed, in the presence of the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432, CX3CL1 failed to depolarize threshold current (Fig.\@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)), illustrating that those receptors were involved in this effect.<!--Consistent with the observed decrease in inhibitory synaptic transmission and lack of change in excitatory synaptic transmission (Figures \@ref(fig:)), the effects of CX3CL1 were abolished by the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432 (Fig. \@ref(fig:))-->
However, one would expect that reduced principal cells' firing is a consequence of increased inhibition onto those cells.<!--lepiej napisać // -->
In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA (Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC), reflected as decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs.
Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) [@bellingham_1996; @doze_1991], sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015 , and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses-->
Moreover, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, whereas a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses [@dekoninck_1994; @otis_1994].<!--bardziej zmienić?-->
Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 application, which was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggests a CX3CL1-mediated inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking and/or a decreased reactivity or number of GABA~A~ postsynaptic receptors.<!--decreased inputs onto BLA principal cells, probably due to--><!-- Thus, these results provide direct evidence that CX3CL1 impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA by reducing spontaneous spiking of local interneurons.//Nevertheless, our results provide direct evidence that NF knockdown impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA by reducing functional GABAAreceptors at the postsynaptic site.// Thus, consistent with our previous findings, it is likely that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms contribute to the fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation onto CeL neurons ( Li et al., 2013 ). -->
Nevertheless, these results provide direct evidence that CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission within the BLA, probably by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.<!-- może silniej? direct evidence?-->
However, to the best of my knowledge, only a postsynaptic mechanism of CX3CL1-triggered modulation of GABAergic transmission was previously reported.
In the dorsal raphe nucleus, CX3CL1(10nM) enhanced postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptor number or sensitivity selectively on serotonergic neurons under conditions of both spontaneous and synaptically-evoked GABA release [@heinisch_2009].
Similar action was reported in another electrophysiological study using human tissue from epileptic patients. 
The epileptic tissue is characterized by more pronounced desensitization of GABA~A~ receptors than healthy tissue, manifested as an increasing decrease in GABA~A~-mediated currents following repetitive GABA applications.<!--Desensitization is a general term that describes a decrease or loss of biological response following prolonged or repetitive stimulation //to repetitive activation of GABA~A~ receptor//Electrophysiology studies indicate aCX3CL1-mediated enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) amplitude and dose-dependent increase of evoked IPSC (eIPSC) amplitude without affecting eIPSC paired–pulse ratio, a finding observed selectively in 5-HT neurons.--><!-- Thus, CX3CL1 enhances postsynaptic GABA receptor number or sensitivity on 5-HT DRN neurons under conditions of both spontaneous and synaptically-evoked GABA release. // CX3CL1 may indirectly inhibit 5-HT neuro-transmission by increasing the sensitivity of 5-HT DRN neu-rons to GABA inputs. / GABA-mediated sIPSC recordings were isolated by additionof the non-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H, 4H)-dione (DNQX; 20M) and were recorded for 6 min. CX3CL1 (10 nM) was then added to the perfusion bath, -->
However, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce this rundown in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients [@roseti_2013], illustrating that it might stabilize GABA~A~ receptor currents.<!-- It should be noted that epileptic tissue usually is less responsive to the repeated activation of GABA~A~ receptors (i.e., showing increased rundown after repetitive activation) than those from healthy tissue [@ragozzino_2005].-->
<!-- BOTH POST-SYNAPTIC EFFECTS, HERE PRESYNAPTIC ....and postsynaptic. different subunitis of GABA~A~? in the amygdala vs in the DRN? +SEROTNIN INPUTS TO AMYGDALA?--><!--use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the GABA-evoked currents// In particular, the repetitive activation of GABAA receptors produces a use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the evoked currents (IGABA), which is markedly enhanced in the hippocampus and cortex of drug-resistant mTLE patients.--><!-- GABAAreceptors from epileptic tissue (hippocampus and neo-cortex) become less responsive to repeated activation (as detected by current rundown) than those from healthy tissue (Palma et al.,2004, 2007a, b;Ragozzino et al.,2005).// -->
Hence, both studies reported CX3CL1-triggered modulation of postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, leading to increased sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to GABA inputs.<!--These results suggest CX3CL1 reduces neuronal excitability by stabilizing GABA~A~ receptor currents. // These results are in line with previous report indicating that CX3CL1 reduce GABA~A~ receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human epileptic patients [@roseti_2013]. /// For example, fractalkine (CX3CL1) was shown to reduce GABA~A~ use-dependent receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human TLE membranes (Roseti et al., 2013), suggesting it reduces excitability by stabilizing receptor currents. ///zmienić -->
Importantly, one study also documented that inhibitory tone and GABA~A~ receptors mediated the effect of CX3CL1 on the LTP in the dentate gyrus [@sheridan_2014].<!--EFFECTS OF CX3CL1 ON LTP IN THE DENTATE GYRUS DEPENDS ONINHIBITORY TONE AND GABAARECEPTORS ///Interestingly, CX3CL1 did not prevent LTP in the presence of picrotoxin (Figure 4C). In fact, when picro-toxin was present, the magnitude of LTP was enhanced by CX3CL1 during the initial 20 min following the TBS (p<0.05). -->
While CX3CL1 reduced the magnitude of LTP in the DG, this phenomenon was more pronounced in the additional presence of a GABA~A~ blocker.
Hence, all these findings, including those presented in this dissertation, highlight that the actions of the chemokine CX3CL1 may vary depending on the balance between excitation and inhibition in the network. <!-- They suggest that neuronal responses to CX3CL1 can vary depending on the balance between excitation and inhibition in the hippocampal network.-->
Thus, at least in the hippocampus, the CX3CL1 neuroprotective inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission is thought to be present during periods of enhanced excitatory activity and intact GABA~A~ receptor activity.<!--Therefore, during periods of enhanced excitatory activity in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 may act as a neuropro-tective dampener of excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission and this action appears to be dependent on GABA-mediated inhibition-->
<!-- in the hippocampus and here?-->
Whether other chemokines orchestrate the I/E balance and mechanisms underlying those effects are still unexplained.<!--+ WHETER DEPEND ON CELL TYPE ? -->

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials.<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. // plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AACs can control action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold, or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014).

This was reported to happen either *via* changing the action potential threshold or by shifting the site of origin.<!-- zmienić i przeczytać cytowania? -->

Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs' spiking output and timing [@woodruff_2006].-->
Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin (PV).<!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->
Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some chandelier cells, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input [@spampanato_2016; @szabadics_2006; @woodruff_2006]. <!--Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ).-->

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by @saha_2016 has shown that exclusive reduction of a pool of GABAergic synapses innervating the AIS of BLA projection neurons resulted in similar differences observed after acute CX3CL1 application.
Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as well as impaired LTP.
What is more, the decreased excitability of principal cells was associated with depolarized threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered [@saha_2016; @zonta_2011].
In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014).<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).-->

<!-- Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). -->
At the network level, while impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA pathway after CX3CL1 treatment in the BLA is consistent with CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells' excitability, its relation to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first sight.<!-- While impaired LTP in the vSub – BLA pathway after NF knockdown in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition by NF knockdown appears counterintuitive on first sight. // Because a large majority of the inhibitory signaling within the BLA is provided by locally projecting interneurons, one would expect reductions in interneuron synaptic number and/or activity to have a profound effect on the excitatory output of this region. 
Inhibitory synaptic plasticity has previously been demonstrated within the BLA (Szinyei et al. 2007), and reduced GABAergic activity facilitates long-term potentiation of thalamic input to the lateral amygdala (Bissiere et al. 2003).--> 
However, mounting evidence indicates that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons [@mcdonald_2011; @unal_2014], thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the induction of LTP in this structure.<!-- ładne zdanie ale trochę zmienić /// Increasing evidence suggests that different BLA afferents target specific subpopulations of interneurons (Leitermann et al , 2016; McDonald et al , 2011; Unal et al , 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA local networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure-->
Similar to the cellular level, the chandelier PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation is a good candidate for observed CX3CL1-mediated actions in the BLA.
For instance, it may be related to previous studies suggesting rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA [@woodruff_2010].<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej --> 
Following this idea, CX3CL1 could inhibit those cells, leading to an observed reduction in the BLA network. 
In line with this hypothesis, TNF`r knitr::asis_output("")` and IL-1b, other immune proteins displaying neuromodulatory activity, were demonstrated to impair specifically PV-expressing neurons in the striatum.
It led to disturbance of network homeostasis manifested as a reduction in GABAergic transmission and abnormal neuronal firing [@rossi_2011].

Moreover, the external capsule contains mainly cortical fibers [@mahanty_1999].<!-- inputs from cortex-->
Besides targeting principal cells, monosynaptic connections from the cortex recruit local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits.<!--There are monosynaptic connections from cortex to the BLA, and, in addition to principal cells, they can recruit local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits. // Monosynaptic cortical – BLA projections exist, and can recruit not only principal cells, but also local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits, but the role of AACs remains unclear (Bazelot et al , 2015; Hübner et al , 2014). sprawdzić te cytowania i to przemyśleć...-->
In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits [@veres_2014].<!--Given that cortical afferents represent only a minor part of BLA afferents substantial part of BLA inputs and AACs were reported to form reciprocal connections with PCs, they could also be part of local feedback circuits.// However, vSub afferents represent (for example, Canteras et al , 1992) and AACs are also reciprocally connected to projections neurons, suggesting they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al , 2014).-->
Accordingly, both types of network mechanisms might be involved when stimulating the external capsule.<!-- this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar local inhibitory networks.-->

Of note, during fear conditioning, conditioned stimuli (CS) were reported to activate PV-expressing interneurons, which in turn inhibited SOM-positive interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of PCs dendrites which facilitate excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).<!-- inaczej napisać Interestingly, it has been shown that conditioned stimuli (CS) activate PV INs during fear conditioning, which in turn inhibit SOM INs, resulting in a disinhibition of PN dendrites which facilitates excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).-->
Hence, in line with the hypothesis that CX3CL1 specifically acts on chandelier cells, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition of this subpopulation activity could prevent this disinhibition, leading to the observed here impaired long-term potentiation, and thus eliciting anxiolytic effects.<!--poprawić-->


The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning.

Noting that various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, a better understanding of their specialized roles is of high importance. 

Considering the previously reported CX3CL1 modulation of GABA~A~ receptors in epileptic tissue [@roseti_2013; @yeo_2011], together with increasing evidence of its regulation of excitatory/inhibitory circuits balance (@sheridan_2014, and this study), strongly suggest molecule as a potential candidate for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy. <!--Various chemokines and their receptors are increased in both parenchymal brain cells and leukocytes in human and experimental epilepsy (Cerri et al., 2017; de Vries et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2018).

A more complete understanding of the intrinsic excitatory/inhibitory circuit balance of the amygdala and how imbalances in inhibitory control contribute to excessive BLA excitability will guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric diseases <!-- ładne conclusion --><!-- DODAĆ JESZCZE CHEMOKINE CONTRIBUTION???? -->
 
In addition, given that the BLA is a region highly innervated by a set of neuromodulators, together with the demonstrated ability of chemokines, including CX3CL1, to impact those systems, other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators contribution cannot be excluded.
However, many neuromodulatory inputs to the BLA are absent in coronal slices containing the amygdala.
Hence, despite the previously reported action of CX3CL1 on 5-HT neurons in the DRN, serotonin contribution to reported effects of acute exogenous application of this chemokine is unlikely. 
Nevertheless, given that both 5-HT and CX3CL1 are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, exploring the network and behavioral consequences of their potential interactions in the BLA in *in vivo* models will also be of great importance. 
<!-- dokończyć--><!--Neuromodulation?
It should be noted that immune proteins, including CX3CL1, exerts their neuromodulatory role not only by directly acting on GABAergic and glutamatergic systems or neuronal properties, but also indirectly by affecting other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators.
NE - Activation of β -receptors, which seems to be present on both pyramidal cells and interneurons at least in the amygdala (Farb, Chang, & LeDoux, 2010) induces the phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunit thereby lowering the threshold for synaptic delivery of GluA1 containing AMPARs during LTP expression. (Hu et al., 2007). 
Additionally, it has been shown that blocking of β -receptors by propranolol reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs in the LA (Zhou et al., 2015). 
Consequently, a reduced supply of NA in TPH2− / −mice might lead to a decreased phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunits followed by a reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs, which might cause an attenuated LTP expression. from [@gebhardt_2019] 

It is well-known that α2-receptors primarily serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. Activation of α2-receptors exerts inhibition of spontaneous activity (Buffalari & Grace, 2007) probably via inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+channels and activation of inward rectifying K+channels and seems to inhibit both LTP and LTD in the basolateral amygdala (DeBock et al., 2003).

Thus, in mice lacking brain serotonin we found long-term plasticity changes both in the amygdala and in the hippocampus. 
Priming of LTP by prior paired pulse stimulation seemed to compensate the deficits of serotonin in the brain at the level of the functional readout.

## CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala {#discusscx3cl1cea}

In the present study, the CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulation in the CeL circuit was identified.
Specifically, acute application of CX3CL1 on brain slices containing the amygdala resulted in cell-specific changes in the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons, accompanied by affected membrane properties, while membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons were mainly unaffected in response to CX3CL1. 
These changes were accompanied by the regulation of GABAergic transmission by CX3CL1. 
Thus, these findings strongly suggest that CX3CL1 acts as a neuromodulator in the CeL.

The central nucleus of the amygdala is considered a limbic hub, where many parallel neuronal circuits coexist and interact. 
Indeed, it is demonstrated to be involved in autonomic regulation, emotion, motivated behavior, and fear circuitry.<!--autonomic regulation, emotion, and motivated behavior.-->
It should be noted that this study focused on the lateral part of the central amygdala, as more and more data indicates its crucial role in fear learning.<!--Recent studies indicate that the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CeL) is essential for fear learning. Specifically, fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific synaptic plasticity in CeL neurons that is required for the storage of fear memories.peennzoo-->
The CeL was considered for a long time to gate fear expression by tonically inhibiting medial subdivision of the central amygdala (CeM), the well-known major amygdala output to downstream fear effectors that control defensive responses ( LeDoux et al., 1988 ; Johansen et al., 2011 ).
However, later findings showed its ability to send long-distance projections to PAG and PVN, which were shown to regulate fear expression independent of CeM [@penzo_2014].<!-- These long-range projection CeL neurons are predominantly somatostatin-positive (SOM) neurons, which can directly inhibit PAG neurons, and some of which innervate both the PAG and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Notably, fear conditioning potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission onto these long-range projection CeL neurons. Thus, our study identifies a subpopulation of SOMCeL neurons that may contribute to fear learning and regulate fear expression independent of CeM.[@penzo_2014] -->

CeL consists of a diverse set of GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features [@cassell_1989; @ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016; @li_2013a; @lopezdearmentia_2004; @martina_1999]. <!--theCeLmicrocircuitconsistsofmostlyGABA-releasing (GABAergic) inhibitory neurons with different functional and molecular features (Cassell et al., 1999;Martina et al., 1999;Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004;Ciocchi et al., 2010;Haubensak et al., 2010;Amano et al., 2012;Li et al., 2013). /// The CeL contains diverse GABAergic neuron classes, but the synaptic organization of local inhibitory circuits in this region is largely unknown. -->
Electrophysiologically, the Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons are the two major subtypes of neurons, representing about 90% of all neurons in the CeL.<!-- połączyć że dwa typyi jak się do siebie mają populacje --> 
Regarding neurochemical markers, also two major and mutually exclusive CeL subpopulations express either SOM or PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`, accounting for approximately 90% of the whole neuronal population [@haubensak_2010; @li_2013a].<!--citations--><!--Despite the fact that these physiological and molecular markers did not entirely correspond with each other, there was they express different markers, but also ... fear on of -->
While PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons form a relatively homogeneous group and represent mainly of Late-Firing cells (`r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`85% vs. `r knitr::asis_output("\U223C")`15% SOM-positive, @haubensak_2010), around 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the Regular-Spiking neurons and the remaining 40% representing PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons [@haubensak_2010; @li_2013a].

In addition, the differences between those two subpopulations have interesting functional consequences.
Following fear-conditioning, PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons respond to the CS with a reduction in activity; thus, they are also known as CeL~OFF~ cells [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010].
Moreover, these neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons [@haubensak_2010; @li_2013a].
In sharp contrast, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, and therefore are also known as CeL~ON~ cells [@ciocchi_2010; @haubensak_2010; @hou_2016].
Sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in freely moving mice [@li_2013].
Of note, the selective inhibition of those neurons markedly impairs fear memory [@li_2013].
Those neurons were shown to extensively inhibit PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-containing neurons within the CeL, whereas CeM neurons are not their target [@li_2013a].

The activation of SOM-positive neurons is anxiogenic, as they inhibit PKC`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B4")`-expressing neurons, thereby disinhibiting CeM [@ciocchi_2010].
Given that Regular-Spiking neurons correspond to 60% of SOM-positive cells, the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduced excitability of those cells could prevent CeM disinhibition.
Hence, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 exerts anxiolytic-like action in the CeL.
<!-- These findings suggest that activation of SOMneurons promotes fear expression, at least in part, by inhibiting PKC-(SOM) neurons, thereby disinhibiting CeM. They also suggest that the fear conditioning-induced synaptic modifications in CeL likely underlie the changes in cell firing in CeL and CeM during fear conditioning ( Ciocchi et al., 2010 ; Duvarci et al., 2011 ).--> 
<!-- This study indicates that the acute CX3CL1 application reduced CeL neurons' excitability, specifically in Regular-Spiking cells.--><!--We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened ( Li et al., 2013 ).-->

However, unlike what was observed in the BLA, the reduction of neuronal firing was manifested not by threshold current but changes in the overall number of spikes to injections of increasing depolarizing currents. 
<!-- This kind of specificity - other chemokines too - and cx3cl1 - serotonin. rozwinąć // Importantly, this CX3CL1-mediated firing depression was specific to Regular-Spiking neurons, as it was absent in the Late-Firing cells.-->
Consistently, in addition to excitability, other membrane properties were altered after CX3CL1 acute treatment. 
Specifically, Regular-Spiking neurons were more depolarized, while their input resistance and time membrane constant were significantly reduced, suggesting the opening of some channels.
The observed depolarization of neuronal membrane potential during reduced firing may seem counterintuitive at first; however, this set of changes resembles hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel (HCN) activation, a type of peculiar potassium channels mediating I~h~ currents.<!-- lepiej --> 
Consistent with this speculation, CeA neurons express HCN channels, especially the HCN1 subtype [@chieng_2006; @notomi_2004; @weera_2021]. 
Unfortunately, their role in this circuitry is largely unexplored.<!--It is speculative whether microglial ramification may be connected to its polarization and synaptic remodeling function, but scanty evidence is available so far.-->
To the best of my knowledge, although the chemokine modulation of several types of channels was previously reported, observations from this study point to a previously unrecognized link between CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling and HCN channels.
It also raises the possibility that other chemokines and immune cells may also modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.<!-- Moreover, the link between CX3CL1 effects on neuronal excitability and intrinsic properties and I~h~ currents should be verified. // this is the first study suggesting the CX3CL1-mediated action on HCN channels. /// Moreover,--> 

I~h~ currents impact several aspects of neural and network activity.
Specifically, they can depolarize membrane potentials, generate subthreshold oscillations, and are involved in synchronizing network rhythms (Brown and Difrancesco, 1980;Bobker and Williams, 1989;Dickson et al., 2000;Biel et al., 2009;Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009;Ferrante et al., 2017).<!--- as relevance of HCN,/// cells. HCN currents influence several aspects of neural and network activity: they can depolarize membrane potentials (inward current), generate subthreshold oscillations, and postinhibitory rebound mediated by Ih may help synchronize network rhythms (Brown and Difrancesco, 1980;Bobker and Williams, 1989;Dickson et al., 2000;Biel et al., 2009;Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009;Ferrante et al., 2017).-->
<!-- zaburzenia które i CeL i CX3CL1 --> 
Noting recent evidence indicating the modulation of HCN channels by other immune proteins, namely interferon `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")` (IFN`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`) and interferon `r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")` (IFN`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B3")`) in the cortex [@janach_2020], together with a discovered expression of those channels in microglia [@kim_2020a; @vay_2020], further investigations are warranted to better characterize the I~h~ activation and inhibition in CeL circuit, especially in the context of neuroimmune regulation and neuron-glial cross-talk.

In contrast, membrane properties of Late Firing neurons were unaffected by exogenous CX3CL1. 
On the other hand, this chemokine reduced GABAergic synaptic transmission specifically onto those neurons, which was reflected as a decrease in both the median amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs.
It should be noted that not only CeL neurons are densely interconnected, but also synapses formed by different subtypes of neurons are stronger than those between neurons between the same subpopulation [@hou_2016].
<!--Despite the fact that CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes. zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. --> 
For example, synapses formed between LF`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`RS and RS`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`LF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class [@hou_2016].<!-- bardziej zmienić Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses [@hou_2016].Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression [@hou_2016]. <!-- zmienić --><!-- the efficacy of the ES ¡ LS or LS ¡ ES synapse was > 2-fold greater than that of the LS ¡ LS or ES ¡ ES synapse. /// density --> 
This evidence is in good agreement with the presented data. 
It can be hypothesized that reducing excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons would lead to the downregulated GABAergic transmission.
Hence, Regular-Spiking neurons form more dense and potent synapses onto local, different subpopulations of neurons, e.i., Late-Firing.
Consistently, the CX3CL1-modulated reduction of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons should be more prominent than onto Regular-Spiking cells.


Altogether, this study illustrated that CX3CL1 led to decreased activity in both, pyramidal-like cells in the BLA as well as Regular-Spiking neurons in the CeL.
However, while principal cells displayed CX3CL1-mediated elevated threshold current, the lower number of evoked spikes in response to increasing depolarizing somatic current injections was present in Regular-Spiking neurons.
<!-- these effects were a result of different parameters (decreased threshold current in the BLA vs. decreased number of spikes induced by increasing current injections.-->
Thus, probably different downstream events were involved. 
In line with this, altered membrane properties of Regular-Spiking cells were observed following CX3CL1 treatment.
It might, therefore, be conceivable that these membrane changes are associated with direct activation of CX3CR1 expressed by SOM-positive neurons. 
However, our immunofluorescent data is inconclusive due to the high density of SOM-positive cells together with its inputs within the CeL, all of which is stained by antibody against this marker, and co-localization with CX3CR1 cannot be unambiguously analyzed (data not shown).
Thus, more sensitive staining approaches should be utilized to resolve this issue, such as RNA-scope or RNA-sequencing transcriptome.<!--PLA, single cell -->

Hence, presented findings suggest that CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission, leading to decreased reciprocal interactions between Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing, thereby hindering CeM activity and outputs.

## Microglial action in the amygdala {#microfuckingglia}

When discussing potential mechanisms of neuromodulatory actions of the CX3CL1, the controversy regarding the localization of its sole receptor, CX3CR1, should be acknowledged.
While some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia [@tarozzo_2003; @cardona_2006], several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons [@hatori_2002; @heinisch_2009; @hughes_2018; @limatola_2005; @maciejewskilenoir_1999; @sheridan_2014; @ruchaya_2012; @ruchaya_2014; @tarozzo_2003; @verge_2004; @zhuang_2007].<!--+ nowsze-->
Notably, the data presented here do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons, and the possibility that these electrophysiological effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia cannot be ruled out. 
<!-- If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought.-->

<!--n the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, the CX3CR1 receptor  gene  has  been  replaced  by  a  green  fluorescent protein  (GFP)  reporter [@jung_2000].
Based on CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression, this genetic strain provides the most studied model to investigate the consequences of neuron-microglia communication following CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis dysregulation.->

Moreover, microglia are getting much attention regarding its role beyond inflammation, and transgenic mice with knock down of CX3CR1 replaced with GFP - exclusively in microglia.<!-- lepiej --> 
In the past decade, new research has emerged providing evidence and insight into the functions of these cells.
Briefly, microglia are crucial in refining the neuronal network both under physiological and pathological conditions either directly through physical contacts and soluble factors release [@tremblay_2010; @wake_2009]<!--jeszcze wydzielanie--> or indirectly *via* interactions with astrocytes [@liddelow_2017]. 
The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is believed to be a crucial component of the microglia-neuron crosstalk due to its expression pattern.<!-- better written // One of the key elements in the microglia–neuron crosstalk, deeply linked to the synaptic refinement and modulation, is the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis.<!-- --> 
Thus, most of these studies were done using the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, in which the CX3CR1 receptor  gene  has  been  replaced  by  a  green  fluorescent protein  (GFP)  reporter [@jung_2000].
Given that only microglial cells were identified to express GFP in these mice, all studies using this strain strengthen the notion of a microglial specific CX3CR1 expression. 
Nevertheless, microglia from CX3CR1-deprived mice show decreased microglial branching and altered motility [@basilico_2019].<!--więcej? --> 
Moreover, disruption of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling causes alternations in synaptic transmission [@basilico_2019]<!--więcej-->, plasticity [@maggi_2009; @maggi_2011; @rogers_2011], brain connectivity [@zhan_2014], and behavior [@piirainen_2021; @rogers_2011; @schubert_2018; @zhan_2014].<!-- highlighting ? --><!--zmienić drugą część zdania....

Therefore, to identify the involvement of microglia in CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulatory effects observed in this study, a subset of slices were pre-applied with minocycline, which is commonly used to inhibit microglial activation, also in electrophysiological studies (for example: @scianni_2013).<!--citations wiecej!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-->
However, it was fully acknowledged that minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that  has powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and  antioxidant properties, which has some other unrelated effects, including direct action on neurons.<!-- It should be noted that although minocycline is commonly used to inhibit microglial activation, there are some studies illustrating its direct neuronal action <Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation.

Thus, considering all these issues, unfortunately, the presented pharmacological approach in this study by using a moderately specific inhibitor is not sufficient to draw any strong conclusion in the context of neuron-microglia cross talk.
Nevertheless, a few observations in this study might be insightful in this regard, when further replicated and explored by using methods allowing for a more precise temporal and cellular manipulation, such as, for example, optogenetic/chemogenetic techniques. lepiej napisać -->
Thus, it should be noted that the findings presented in this study do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons or complete inhibition of microglial activity by minocycline.
The possibility that the observed effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia or/and minocycline acts directly on neurons cannot be discounted.

Nevertheless, the CX3CL1-mediated downregulation of GABAergic transmission and elevated threshold current in principal cells in the BLA were not observed when minocycline was pre-applied, raising the possibility that microglia may be involved in this process.<!-- However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).-->
Interestingly, minocycline applied alone was shown to facilitate principal cells' firing and affect the kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.
The similar situation was observed in CeL, where Late-Firing neurons were more excitable following minocycline incubation.
<!-- These unexpected findings ....  -->
Regardless of the cellular site of this minocycline-induced glutamatergic enhancement, when both minocycline and CX3CL1 were present, neither the CX3CL1- nor the minocycline-mediated effects were observed, suggesting their opposing actions in the amygdala.<!--raises the interesting possibility. /// there is a possibility that the mechanisms underlying CX3CL1-mediated increase in threshold current and minocycline-induced actions on glutamatergic transmission and principal-cells activity are independent. -->
This idea is further supported by a recent study by @yuan_2020, in which they inhibited or activated microglia by infusion into CeA either minocycline or CX3CL1.<!-- WAS-induced changes in microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in the CeA, and visceral hypersensitivity were reversed by minocycline whereas in stress-naïve rats, fractalkine induced microglial deramification and visceral hypersensitivity.-->

It is worth noticing that CX3CL1 was bath-applied onto BLA neurons after the minocycline-induced upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity.
Hence, CX3CL1 might eliminate this minocycline-induced enhancement of glutamatergic drive, supporting the hypothesis that CX3CL1 action depends on the initial state of the network and restoring the disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance [@bertollini_2006; @sheridan_2014].<!-- there is a possibility that the CX3CL1 treatment abolished prior minocycline-mediated elevated excitability of pyramidal-like neurons independently on CX3CR1 activation instead of elimination of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on neuronal firing by minocycline.--> 
This idea is consistent with the observed here CX3CL1 complex actions on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA: CX3CL1 was shown to decrease the frequency of sEPSC onto BLA neurons with higher frequency during baseline, especially at the concentration of 5nM.
In accordance, this and other studies demonstrated the TTX-sensitive modulation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synaptic transmission by CX3CL1, supporting their actions at the network level [@heinisch_2009].
Finally, the potential role in maintaining the E/I balance, along with a rather action-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission, was also proposed to other chemokines and cytokines, including IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")` and TNF`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B1")`, suggesting the similar action of the immune proteins in brain physiology.<!-- (citations) --><!--In line with the hypothesis - homeostasis synaptic scaling - there is possibility that, regardless of the mechanism of minocycline-induced increase in PCs' excitability, the lack of observed effects when CX3CL1 is added to pre-applied minocycline is its "normalizing" action.CX3CL1 could decreased the previously elevated PCs' firing as well as kinetics of sEPSCThese issues findings are hard to interpret, especially when ....inspecific many explanations--> 

<!-- Changed kinetics of sEPSC - was previously demonstrated in astrocytes when extrasynaptic AMPA receptors, too much glutamate - 
Thus, minocycline could elevate glutamate by activating extrasynaptic AMPA. -->
<!-- zmienić
Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. 
Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). 
Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. 
Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->

<!--glial impact?
By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

Rats in the minocycline group  showed a gradual decrease of freezing time during the ex-  tinction session, indicating that fear extinction was not disrupted by a single application of minocycline.

Activation of microglia is associated with  increased release of IL-1  β  and TNF-  α  ,both of which promote hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony via transcriptional or post-transcription  al mechanisms [33, 46].

For instance, minocycline inhibited Na+ currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells ( Kim et al., 2011 ), suppressed Na+ and Ca2+ currents in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ), and reduced evoked synaptic currents ( Cho et al., 2006 ) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents ( Liu et al., 2015 ) in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons.

For example, minocycline (50 nM) had no effect on basal excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 ( Pascual et al., 2012 )  or SG neurons ( Berta et al., 2014 ); however, 100 l M minocycline  may  inhibit  dorsal  root  entry  zone stimulation-elicited EPSCs in SG neurons ( Cho et al., 2006 ) or may decrease sEPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ). At a concentration of 200 l M, minocycline may decrease C-fiber evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). In addition, minocycline at 500 l M abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons ( Itoh et al., 2011 ).-->

To sum up, although the underlying cellular mechanisms and the possible regulation of local neuron-glia communication in the amygdala is still largely unknown, this study has shown that both CX3CL1 and minocycline modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala.<!-- ładniej.... --->

Hence, considering all these issues, the microglial contribution to the observed CX3CL1-mediated effect strongly warrants further investigation.<!--Thus, these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.lepiej napisać-->

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling modulates dendritic spines morphology in the cultures neurons from the amygdala

The spine morphology was also examined, as changes in spine morphology are believed to represent one mechanism of modulating synaptic activity.
Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014), while GABAergic terminals contact only a low proportion of them (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014, Müllner et al., 2015).<!--zmienić Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that harbor most excitatory synapses in the brain. /// Spines are specialized postsynaptic elements (see also Shepherd, 1996) that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014).

Hence, observed changes in dendritic spine morphology further indicate a significant impact of CX3CL1 acute application on amygdala physiology.<!--jakoś inaczej to napisać we wstępie na początku...-->
Indeed, spines with large, prominent heads and short necks are generally thought to be stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and form stronger synaptic connections than thin spines [@ganeshina_2004; @harris_1992; @kasai_2003].<!--Mushroom spines with a large, prominent head and short neck are generally thought to form stronger synapses than thin spines. zmienić // Spines with large heads are stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and contribute to strong synaptic connections. // Indeed, thin spines are motile, transient, and form weak or silent synapses, whereas spines with large heads (i.e. mushroom and stubby) are more stable and form strong synapses with larger postsynaptic densities, more AMPA-type glutamate receptor content, and larger presynaptic contacts [30,44,45].-->

This type of dendritic spine morphology dominates during development and is considered immature.
Here, cultured primary neurons from the amygdala showed a trend toward wider dendritic heads upon CX3CL1(5nM) application. 
Intriguingly, when neurons were cultured in the additional presence of AraC, which was shown to reduce the number of glial cells in culture without altering neuronal viability [@schwieger_2016], the CX3CL1(5nM) application led to decreased length and width of dendritic spines. 
Notably, no difference between these parameters was observed between the control and AraC-supplemented medium, illustrating that AraC treatment did not affect dendritic morphology.
Thus, it is possible that these unexpected findings might reflect the CX3CL1-mediated neuron-glial cross-talk.
We hypothesize that during the "normal" condition, the CX3CL1 treatment activated CX3CR1 receptors on both amygdalar neurons and the remaining glial fraction of cells (5%), leading to observed CX3CL1-modulated wider dendritic spines.<!-- This is consistent with .... -->
Our immunostaining data showed that the CX3CR1 receptor was expressed on both neurons and astrocytes, further supporting this hypothesis.
Given that glia, especially microglia and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis, are crucial players in the dendritic maturation [@bols_2018; @paolicelli_2011], together with the microglial abundance of CX3CR1 expression [@cardona_2006], it is plausible that this trend could be more prominent when glial component is higher.

Interestingly, when CX3CL1 was applied in the AraC-cultured neurons, the dendritic spines were shorter and thinner. 
This finding suggests that despite affecting neuronal conditions, the presence of AraC induced changes, which led to different CX3CL1-mediated responses. 
We hypothesize that AraC could disrupt or change the neuron-glial communication by further reducing the number of surrounding glial cells. 
For example, given that the CX3CR1 receptor expression is more pronounced in glia, especially microglia, the observed changes may result from the activation of CX3CR1 on neurons, which is not detected and compensated in the presence of a higher number of glial cells.  
Alternatively, in the presence of AraC, the cultures release different compositions of signaling molecules, which in turn affects the CX3CL1-mediated actions on dendritic spines morphology.<!-- and the due to high microglial component or normally is normalized by presence of microglia, or that the to
Moreover, under conditions of a more decreased number of surrounding glial cells, the CX3CL1-mediated neuron-glial communication is more limited and the activation of CX3CR1 on glial cells further reduced and under those conditions CX3CL1-mediated effects led to observed shorter and thinner dendritic spines. --> 

It is thought that the AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).
Similarly, @basilico_2019 found that CX3CR1^-/-^ transgenic mice displayed a higher number of silent synapses in the hippocampus in comparison to their wild-type littermates.
Those synapses were characterized by an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability.<!--Intriguingly, recordings from CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices of CX3CR1^-/-^ transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability compared to wild-type mice [@basilico_2019], further illustrating that neuron–microglia crosstalk profoundly impacts functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function, and thereby modulating excitatory synaptic transmission. - blocking CX3CR1 receptor - compensatory mechanisms in the hippocampus similar to what is observed in activation of CX3CR1 without microglia in the amygdala? --> 
Noting that this knockout strain is characterized by the absence of CX3CR1 only in microglia, these observations implicate, similar to our findings, that the lack of microglial CX3CR1 activation, either due to transgenic deletion or by a reduced number of those cells, results in an immature phenotype of dendritic spines.
However, in knockout mice, the compensatory mechanisms are possible, whereas, in our neuronal cultures, this morphology was not observed in AraC-cultured neurons in baseline conditions but after CX3CL1 treatment.

<!-- AMPA/NMDA ratio --><!-- Nevertheless, CX3CL1 application in the presence of AraC led to more immature phenotype, suggesting a decreased functional connectivity within the amygdala. -->

On the other hand, the observed immature phenotype of dendritic spines implies decreased functionality of synapses, which is often paralleled with decreased glutamatergic transmission and/or synaptic plasticity
This is in line with the presented CX3CL1-modulated reduction in neuronal activity and impairment of synaptic plasticity at cortico-BLA synapses.
Although dendritic spines imaging and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (neuronal cultures vs. acute slices, respectively), the data's concordance might suggest that similar mechanisms were operated by CX3CL1 in both systems, raising the possibility of the neuronal site of action.
Thus, further experimentation is required to clarify these results. 
<!-- Nevertheless, considering that our cultures were mainly neuronal (> 95%), this needs to be further verified in other experimental settings, such as brain slices and *in vivo*. --><!--In line with electrophysiological data, alterations in dendritic morphology were observed in the primary neuronal cultures of the amygdala.Moreover, accompanying the CX3CL1-mediated LTP impairment was the immature morphology of dendritic spines.--><!-- Nevertheless, the present study revealed CX3CL1-induced alterations involving structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which is in line with the reduced magnitude of LTP. // zmienić // In conclusion, the results of the present study using the dendritic spines imaging in rat pups have provided further evidence that the anxiogenic effects of chronic stress are not apparently associated with remarkable changes of dendritic morphology in pyramidal neurons of the CeA.--><!-- zmienić // The data however have revealed more subtle CRS-induced alterations involving structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which are suggestive of a decreased functional connectivity of the CeA.-->
