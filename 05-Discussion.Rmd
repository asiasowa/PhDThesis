# Discussion

Chemokines are a class of immune proteins emerging as neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication.
Two of them, i.e., CX3CL1 and CXCL12, are particularly important in this regard, as their crucial involvement in neurodevelopment and regulation of both glial and neuronal cells are well-documented.<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 or CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors.
As CXCR4 and CX3CR1 are relatively densely present in the amygdala, the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders, the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored.
To this end, in presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were dissected in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA). 
To investigate the local neuro-glial cross-talk, all electrophysiological experiments in this PhD thesis were performed using acute brain slices.<!-- Since all the experiments presented in here were performed using acute brain slices, it cannot be excluded that observed effects might be also mediated by glial cells. analogous -->

## CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

CX3CL1 is well-known to have neuroprotective actions in different brain regions, by Ca2+ and AMPA reductions...
<!-- neurodevelopment/ psychological conditions?-->
<!-- microglia-->
Moreover, several reports indicated neuromodulatory role of CX3CL1/CX3CR1. 
In particular, CX3CL1 reduced excitatory synaptic transmission ....(Cui et al., 2012) and can induce intracellular Ca 2+ elevation (Deftu et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2005) and increases Na + currents in neurons (Wang et al., 2008), and these effects were associated with enhanced neuronal excitability.<!-- analogous but opposite-->

Despite relatively high levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the amygdala and the involvement of this chemokine in anxiety-related behavior<!--citations-->, the precise role of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway in the amygdala is still unknown.<!-- lepiej napisać -->
This dissertation hereby provide evidence that CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA, significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as impaired long-term potentiation. 
These electrophysiological effects were accompanied by more immature phenotype of dendritic spines following acute CX3CL1 application.<!--Although CX3CR1 is widely acknowledged as pivotal for brain development and function, evidence on how it regulates microglial differentiation under psychosocial stress is limited (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017). We hereby provide evidence that CX3CR1 expression was dampened in both CRS animals and schizophrenia patients, and CX3CR1 gene had less interactions with other brain genes in schizophrenia; this receptor was further found to be important for CD206+ microglial subtype differentiation and morphological process arborization, and its deficiency resulted in social dominancy impairment. --><!-- Application of CX3CL1 on acute brain slices led to the following electrophysiological effects: (1) depression of principal cell's excitability, (2) reduction of GABAergic transmission, manifested as a decreased median frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents, (3) the impairment in the long-term potentiation.-->

Excitatory activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region that plays a central role in emotion and motivational processing, it tightly regulated by many factors, including neuromodulators.<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Consistent with this notion, CX3CL1, having increasingly evident neuromodulatory role, reduced neuronal excitability, recorded from excitatory pyramidal-like cells while perfused onto amygdalar slices (Figures \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak), manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting of action potential.<!--One of the main effects induced by CX3CL1 in the BLA is a decreased principal cell's excitability .--><!-- The presented data suggest that although no clear pattern of CX3CL1 on excitatory synaptic transmission was observed, this chemokine suppressed the firing of excitatory principal cells, manifested as an increase in their threshold current. ///needed for eliciting action potentials? the same level of excitability? rheobase?--><!--The CX3CL1–induced decrease in excitability of BLA principal cells manifested as an increase in threshold current, together with an broadening of action potentials,tutaj broadining statistically significant in 2nM, but only tendency in 5nM, w miarę blokowane, najsłabiej przez AZD8797... suggests that MCP-1 might reduce a K+ conductance. @sun_2006--><!--One of the main effects induced by CX3CL1 in the BLA is a decreased principal cell's excitability ( Figures \@ref(fig:)--><!--CX3CL1 did not significantly affect intrinsic excitability (Figures \@ref(fig:))--><!-- Both LPS injection and CCL2 perfusion onto hippocampal slices increased total neuronal excitability ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G, and 5H), which has contributions from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, as well as the neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties.

This effect was dependent on CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1.
To block this receptor, two approaches were used. 
First, before recordings, a subset of slices was incubated with antibodies against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml).<!--jakieć cytowanie które też tak robiło?-->
This manipulation abolished the observed effect; however a small number of cells still remained responsive to CX3CL1 (Fig. \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)b).
Considering limitation of antibodies penetration, the pharmacological inhibitor of CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797, was employed.
The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting action of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures [@lannes_2019]<!--hamster, 10uM--> as well as *in vivo* administrated both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) [@ho_2020a] and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model [@chen_2020].
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")`, was also used here and was shown to be effective <!-- citations-->, see Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak).
Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not elicit any effect.
Thus, in all experiments, 10`r knitr::asis_output("\U03BC")` was applied, since at this concentration CX3CL1-induced electrophysiological effects were efficiently prevented.
<!--However, this CX3CR1 inhibitor did not change the expression level of the CX3CR1 protein but enhanced the expression level of the CX3CL1 protein. AZD8797 is a non-competitive inhibitor for CX3CR1. The above result suggests that it has no influence on the CX3CR1 protein itself except for affecting  the activation of its downstream signaling pathway. More  intriguingly, AZD8797 increases the expression level of CX3CL1, indicating that there is a feedback loop, probably a compensatory effect after blocking the signaling pathway, which has been pointed out previously but is yet to be further defined [@cederblad_2016].  - [@chen_2020].-->

Notably, a suppression of principal cells' firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance (see Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall1 in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1membraneappendix)).<!--Fig.--><!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->
The action potentials that neurons produce are a result of dynamic interplay between not only the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron, but also their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
Hence, the CX3CL1-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission within BLA was also assessed.<!--cytowanie jakiegos klasyka? // which may be a results of not only neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties, but also from excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. --><!--Most action potentials that neurons emit during their lifetime are produced by a dynamic interplay between the synaptic inputs and the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron. Activity-dependent or neuromodulatory changes targeting these intrinsic properties effectively regulate intrinsic excitability of the neurons and how they  integrate synaptic input into firing output.-->

Unlike what was observed in the hippocampus and ...<!--citations-->[@ragozzino_2006], CX3CL1 application does not clearly reduce excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (Figures \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC) and \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).
One explanation might be that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission, but rather act *via* downstream molecule (e.g., adenosine), which in turn regulate excitatory transmission in the BLA.
Adenosine is a cellular metabolite that acts through four different G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes (A~1~R, A~2A~R, A~2B~R, and A~3~R; @fredholm_2007), behaving as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level [@boison_2010; @cunha_2001; @ribeiro_2010].<!-- Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. [@cunha_2001]--><!-- In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).-->
Considering previously reported CX3CL1-induced release of this molecule from neuronal and microglial cells [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010], together with adenosine opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus depending on the receptor involved [@piccinin_2010], it is a good potential candidate for observed complex and opposite effects of CX3CL1 modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.<!-- koniecznie lepiej napisać....// Among them, A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we previously demonstrated that CX3CL1 triggers the release of adenosine from neuronal and microglial cells (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). This CX3CL1-induced adenosine action on the glutamatergic transmission was revealed to be mediated by A~3~R and, to the lesser extent, A~1~R, in the hippocampus [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010; @piccinin_2010]. Further evidence indicates that the activation of A~1~R and A~3~R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A~2A~R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) observed when the A~1~ and A~3~ receptors are blocked [@piccinin_2010]. // Of note, sole adenosine was demonstrated to decrease the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, even despite the absence of CX3CL1, suggesting adenosine tonic activity in this structure . // Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports describe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). [@rosito_2012]-->
<!-- This notion is further supported  by the fact that -- powiązać to jakoś z microglejem? -->
However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).
<!-- adenosine receptors in the BLA-->

Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission from cell to cell possibly<!--might?--> depend upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?-->
Given that depending on interneuronal subpopulation, these neurons target different subcellular domain of principal cells, it is likely that interneurons contacting synapses mainly on distal dendritic parts are ....<!-- dokończyć tutaj i rozpisać jak to jest z tymi interneuronami -->
<!-- DOKOŃCZYĆ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--->
Noting that experiments in cesium-based intrapipette solution reduce filtering of excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites by blocking potassium channels [@acharjee_2018], investigating whether CX3CL1 application in intrapipette solution containing cesium might result in more clear pattern of changes in the excitatory synaptic transmission.<!-- Cesium reduces filtering of the synaptic currents arising from distal parts of the dendrite by blocking the potassium current, and changes in EPSC frequency seen only with cesium internal suggested that most of the changes were contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites.--><!-- the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connections formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern. bardziej o ITCs and CeA, ale ładne słownictwo-->

As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-induced depression of principal cells firing is the regulation by GABAergic inhibitory system.
Consistent with this idea, this effect was abolished by the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432 (Fig.\@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak)), illustrating that those receptors were involved.<!--Consistent with the observed decrease in inhibitory synaptic transmission and lack of change in excitatory synaptic transmission (Figures \@ref(fig:)), the effects of CX3CL1 were abolished by the GABA~A~ and GABA~B~ receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432 (Fig. \@ref(fig:))-->

<!-- tutaj o tym, że kurczę jednak sIPSC reduced frequency, więc jak to jest? -->
However, it might be expected that reduced inhibition onto principal cells would increase excitability of principal cells rather than reduce their firing.<!--lepiej napisać-->
In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA (Figure \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC). 
Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and synaptic currents caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) [@bellingham_1996; @doze_1991], sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity, and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015-->
Usually, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors, while a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of transmitter release and/or changes in the number of active synapses [@dekoninck_1994; @otis_1994].<!--bardziej zmienić?-->
Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 application may result from a<!--decreased inputs onto BLA principal cells, probably due to--> decreased number of GABAergic synapses onto principal cells, while the number of postsynaptic GABA~A~ receptors remained the same.
Thus, these results  provide  direct  evidence  that CX3CL1 impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA  by  reducing spontaneous spiking of local interneurons.<!-- analogous //Nevertheless,  our  results  provide  direct  evidence  that  NF knockdown impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA  by  reducing  functional  GABAAreceptors  at  the postsynaptic site.-->
Because a large majority of the inhibitory signaling within the BLA is provided by locally projecting interneurons, one would expect reductions in interneuron synaptic number and/or activity to have a profound effect on the excitatory output of this region. 
Inhibitory synaptic plasticity has previously been demonstrated within the BLA (Szinyei et al. 2007), and reduced GABAergic activity facilitates long-term potentiation of thalamic input to the lateral amygdala (Bissiere et al. 2003). 

<!-- nie wiem czy tego nie skrócić-->
This effect is opposite to what was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, where treatment with CX3CL1 led to o a presynaptic GABAergic release onto serotoninergic neurons [@heinisch_2009].
Moreover, one electrophysiological study using human tissue showed that CX3CL1 induced a reduced use-dependent decrease (i.e., rundown) of the GABA-evoked currents in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients [@roseti_2013].<!--use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the GABA-evoked currents// In particular, the repetitive activation of GABAA receptors produces a use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the evoked currents (IGABA), which is markedly enhanced in the hippocampus and cortex of drug-resistant mTLE patients.-->
It should be noted that epileptic tissue usually is less responsive to the repeated activation of GABA~A~ receptors (i.e. showing increased rundown after repetitive activation) than those from healthy tissue [@ragozzino_2005].<!-- GABAAreceptors from epileptic tissue (hippocampus and neo-cortex) become less responsive to repeated activation (as detected by current rundown) than those from healthy tissue (Palma et al.,2004, 2007a, b;Ragozzino et al.,2005).-->
These results suggest CX3CL1 reduces excitability by stabilizing receptor currents.<!--These results are in line with previous report indicating that CX3CL1 reduce GABA~A~ receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human epileptic patients [@roseti_2013]. /// For example, fractalkine (CX3CL1) was shown to reduce GABA~A~ use-dependent receptor desensitization (i.e., rundown), as shown in oocytes transfected with human TLE membranes (Roseti et al., 2013), suggesting it reduces excitability by stabilizing receptor currents. ///zmienić -->


Mounting evidence illustrate that relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials.<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. //  plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated  that  AACs  can  control  action  potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic  inputs, either through changing the action potential  threshold,  or  by  shifting  the  site  of  origin (Douglas  and  Martin,  1990;  Somogyi et    al ,  1982; Wefelmeyer et  al , 2015; Veres et  al , 2014).

This may happen either *via* changing the action potential threshold or by shifting the site of origin.<!-- zmienić i przeczytać cytowania? -->
The only subpopulation of interneuron presently known to innervate the AIS are chandelier cells, also known as AACs [@bazelot_2015].<!-- zmienić trochę // The only interneuron subtype presently described that innervates the AIS are AACs or chandelier cells (Bazelot et  al , 2015).--><!--Importantly, due to its restriction to the AIS, CX3CL1 application and the associated reduction in inhibitory inputs may also affect the properties of evoked action potentials.citations!!!!--><!-- analogous // Moreover, due to its restriction to the AIS, knockdown of NF and the associated reduction in inhibitory inputs may also affect the properties of evoked action potentials. -->
Anatomically, those subpopulation of interneurons express parvalbumin (PV). <!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->
Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some of chandelier cells, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input [@spampanato_2016; @szabadics_2006; @woodruff_2006]. <!--Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ).-->

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by @saha_2016 have shown that  exclusive reduction of a pool of  GABAergic  synapses  innervating  the  AIS  of  BLA projection neurons resulted in similar differences observed after acute CX3CL1 application.
Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, changes in principal cells' excitability, as well as impaired LTP.
What is more, the reduced firing rate of principal cells  was associated with depolarized threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered [@saha_2016; @zonta_2011].
In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential  threshold,  or  by  shifting  the  site  of  origin (Douglas  and  Martin,  1990;  Somogyi et    al ,  1982; Wefelmeyer et  al , 2015; Veres et  al , 2014).<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise  by  shifting  the  action  potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et  al , 2005).-->
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the observed reduction in GABAergic transmission within the BLA as well as inhibition of principal cells' excitability following CX3CL1 treatment might be mediated by PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation.<!-- CX3CL1 likely perturbed the signaling of this specific set of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons. --><!--Following CX3CL1 treatment, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, whereas the input resistance was unaltered. trochę zmienić i zobaczyć czy pisać o action potential hal-width...--><!--The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et al (2011). zmienić i nie rozumiem jak to się ma do całości...--><!-- przeczytać to... // Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF  knockdown  arise  by  shifting  the  action  potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et  al , 2005).--> 
Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). 

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic activity are currently the best characterized forms of synaptic plasticity and are suggested as physiological substrates of learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Bear and Malenka, 1994; Rioult-Pedotti et al., 1998; Whitlock et al., 2006).<!--zmienić, cytowania // Synaptic plasticity mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors is thought to be a primary mechanism underlying the formation of new memories. Activation of GluN2A NMDA receptor subunits may induce long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas low-frequency stimulation of GluN2B receptors induces long-term depression (LTD).-->
<!-- Decreasing of the LTP also consistent with previous findings - anxiety - beneficial - sth with synaptic scaling -->


At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS (e.g., terminals from the auditory thalamus and cortex) and a strong input carrying US information (e.g., footshock).
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, @nabavi_2014). 
Accordingly, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), @kim_2017 found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.


While impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA pathway after CX3CL1 treatment in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive on first sight.<!-- While impaired LTP in the vSub – BLA pathway after NF knockdown in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition by NF knockdown appears counterintuitive on first sight.--> 
However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA[@woodruff_2010].<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej --> 
There are monosynaptic connections from cortex to the BLA, and, in addition to principal cells, they can recruit local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits.<!--Monosynaptic cortical – BLA projections exist, and can recruit not only principal cells, but also local interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits, but the role of AACs remains unclear (Bazelot et  al , 2015; Hübner et  al , 2014). sprawdzić te cytowania i to przemyśleć...-->
Besides external inputs, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits [@veres_2014]. <!--Given that cortical afferents represent only a minor part of BLA afferents substantial part of BLA inputs and AACs were reported to form reciprocal connections with PCs, they could also be part of local feedback circuits.// However, vSub afferents represent  (for example, Canteras et al , 1992) and AACs are also reciprocally connected to projections neurons, suggesting they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al , 2014).-->
Accordingly, this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar  local inhibitory  networks.<!--trochę jeszcze poprawić?-->
Mounting evidence indicate that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons [@mcdonald_2011; @unal_2014], thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure.<!-- ładne zdanie ale trochę zmienić /// Increasing evidence suggests that different BLA afferents target specific subpopulations of interneurons (Leitermann et  al , 2016; McDonald et  al , 2011; Unal et  al , 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA local networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure-->
Interestingly, it has been shown that conditioned stimuli (CS) activate PV INs during fear conditioning, which in turn inhibit SOM INs, resulting in a disinhibition of PN dendrites which facilitates excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).<!-- inaczej napisać Interestingly, it has been shown that conditioned stimuli (CS) activate PV INs during fear conditioning, which in turn inhibit SOM INs, resulting in a disinhibition of PN dendrites which facilitates excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014).-->

Overall, several lines of evidence described above indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, possibly as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms, required for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes [@bertollini_2006; @piccinin_2010]. <!-- i tutaj o tym, że blokując interneurony mamy podwyższenie LTP sheridan 2014-->

Moreover, 


Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that harbor most excitatory synapses in the brain.<!--zmienić -->  
The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits.<!-- zmienić --> 
<!--Abnormalities in dendritic spine density and morphology are common pathologies in autism and schizophrenia. zmienić -->
Dendritic spines provide an enhanced connectivity, modulation of synaptic processing, strength, and plasticity by considerably increasing the computational possibilities between cells (Anderson et al., 2009; Bourne and Harris, 2009; Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Tønnesen and Nägerl, 2016). 
Spines are specialized postsynaptic elements (see also Shepherd, 1996) that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014).
Only a low percentage of spines (although particularly important, Müllner et al., 2015) is contacted by inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing axon terminals (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014).


Morphological features of dendritic spines change in response to environmental stimuli and have an impact on the strength of synaptic connections (Araya et al., 2014; Bosch & Hayashi, 2012).
Mushroom spines with a large, prominent head and short neck are generally thought to form stronger synapses than thin spines. 
Stubby spines and filopodial protrusions are considered immature spines that dominate during development, and their percentage in the adult brain is considerably small. 
The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits. 
In humans, spinogenesis starts prenatally and can be affected by maternal factors.

Spines with large heads are stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and contribute to strong synaptic connections. By contrast, spines with small heads are motile and unstable and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections.

A large body of evidence supports the critical role of dendritic spines and their morphology and stability in connectivity and neuronal excitability [42–44] so the changes in dendritic spine types we found here further suggest a significant impact of CRS exposure on CeA physiology.
Indeed, thin spines are motile, transient, and form weak or silent synapses, whereas spines with large heads (i.e. mushroom and stubby) are more stable and form strong synapses with larger postsynaptic densities, more AMPA-type glutamate receptor content, and larger presynaptic contacts [30,44,45]. ]. 
Thus, an increase in thin spines in parallel with a decrease in mushroom and stubby spines in CeA neurons, as detected in Golgi-stained apical dendrites after CRS exposure and subsequent to a stress-free recovery period, respectively, may be suggestive of a decreased functional connectivity of CeA projections to downstream brainstem targets [3,17]. 
A closely similar pattern of synaptic remodeling indicative of functional blunting, including decreased dendritic spine density, in parallel with increased numbers of thin spines and decreased amounts of mushroom and stubby spines, has been observed  in pyramidal neurons of the mPFC subsequent to chronic restraint stress in rodents [46,47], whereas increased and decreased numbers of thin and stubby spines, respectively, were reported in the CA1 region of the hippocampus as a result of chronic social defeat in adolescent C57BL/6 mice [48].
In conclusion, the results of the present study using the CRS paradigm in rats have provided further evidence that the anxiogenic effects of chronic stress are not apparently associated with remarkable changes of dendritic morphology in pyramidal neurons of the CeA. 
The data however have revealed more subtle CRS-induced alterations involving structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which are suggestive of a decreased functional connectivity of the CeA. 
Of particular relevance is the fact that CRS-induced anxiety-like behavior

Intriguingly, recordings from CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices of CX3CR1^-/-^ transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability compared to wild-type mice [@basilico_2019], further illustrating that neuron–microglia crosstalk profoundly impacts functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function, and thereby modulating excitatory synaptic transmission.

However, it should be noted that neuronal cultures were deprived of microglial cells, thus either pure neuronal effect on dendritic spine is observed, or astroglia were involved.<!--Arac nie jest anty-astroglia?-->

Coupled with observed differences in dendritic spines morphology, presented here results suggest that ...<!-- Coupled with observed differences in proximal and distal spine density, our results suggest that the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory innervation is increased along the distal to proximal axis of principal cells in the BLA. -->

Dendritic spines on excitatory principal cells are critical sites of learning-induced plasticity.


Learning about motivationally important stimuli involves plasticity in the amygdala, a temporal lobe structure. Amygdala-dependent learning involves a growing number of plasticity-related signaling pathways also implicated in brain development, suggesting that learning-related signaling in juveniles may simultaneously influence development. 

Cyclic AMP-response element binding protein may contribute to memory allocation in the mouse amygdala by promoting dendritic spine growth (Sargin et al. 2013).

Rodent research has identified maturation of amygdala neurons throughout infancy and into adolescence (Fig. 3). The amygdala emerges during gestation in rats (Berdel et al. 1997a) and undergoes volumetric changes soon after birth (Berdel et al. 1997b; Chareyron et al. 2012). As the region grows individual amygdala neurons mature, exhibiting pronounced dendritic expansion and emergence of dendritic spines between birth and adolescence (Ryan et al. 2014). Concomitant with structural maturation are pronounced electrophysiological changes in the amygdala. During infancy, amygdala neurons become an order of magnitude less excitable and lose their propensity to fire bursts of action potentials (Ehrlich et al. 2012). Synaptic transmission in the amygdala is also refined during this period (Bosch & Ehrlich 2015; Ehrlich et al. 2013), and adult-like LTP of amygdala afferents emerges during infancy when the amygdala begins to contribute to fear learning (Thompson et al. 2008).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ERK and CREB also regulate neuron morphogenesis, shaping dendrite patterning and the growth of dendritic spines. For instance, BDNF application to developing neurons in culture promotes spinogenesis in a neural activity- and TrkB-dependent manner (Shimada et al. 1998; Tyler & Pozzo-Miller 2003). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor acts via TrkB to enable structural plasticity, destabilizing dendrites and dendritic spines of cortical neurons (Horch et al. 1999) and elevating spine density of dendrites (Sanchez et al. 2006). Consistent with its role in signal transduction, BDNF promotes robust dendritic outgrowth from developing cortical neurons in a neural activity-dependent manner (McAllister et al. 1996), and BDNF is required for dendritic spine enlargement following paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation at individual synapses (Tanaka et al. 2008). Such BDNF-mediated increases in dendritic spine density also require ERK signaling (Alonso et al. 2004).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ERK and CREB promote dendrite expansion and spinogenesis (Alonso et al. 2004; Herold et al. 2011; McAllister et al. 1995), and excessive activation of this pathway may alter amygdala neuron morphology. Dendrite growth and spine emergence proceed into early adolescence in the amygdala (Ryan et al. 2014). In juveniles, amygdala-dependent learning and BDNF–ERK–CREB signaling may cause enlarged or more spine-dense dendrites later in life. As dendrites constitute the major site for synaptic input onto amygdala neurons, dendritic expansion may result in greater synaptic input to amygdala neurons and more capacity for learning related to motivationally relevant stimuli. Interestingly, stress exposure during adolescence causes enlargement of amygdala neuron dendritic arbors (Eiland et al. 2012), which has been suggested to mediate some adverse behavioral effects of chronic stress (McEwen & Chattarji 2004).

The size and geometry of the spine head and neck are believed to be main determinants in synaptic signal compartmentalization, strength and specificity [1], [18].

These features are concordant with an increased number of synapses, an interpretation supported by our Golgi stains where we found a greater density of dendritic spines in EAE mice. A parallel increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and change in AMPAR dynamics is also consistent with an increase in the number of mature functional synapses and dendritic spines in response to EAE induction (Danglot et al., 2012; Hanse et al., 2013). It is thought that new spines are associated with more AMPARs compared with NMDA receptors (Zito et al., 2009). The AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).- Acharjee2018b

Although DA release and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (cultures vs. slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CXCL12 in both systems. <!-- analogous to CX3CL1 dendritic spines and electrophysiology -->

However, immature dendritic filopodia were also increased in rodent model of autism spectrium disorders  [@kim_2017]. <!--Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by various genetic and environmental factors that result in synaptic abnormalities. ASD development is suggested to involve microglia, which have a role in synaptic re fi nement during development. Autophagy and related pathways are also suggested to be involved in ASDs. However, the precise roles of microglial autophagy in synapses and ASDs are unknown. Here, we show that microglial autophagy is involved in synaptic re fi nement and neurobehavior regulation. We found that deletion of atg7, which is vital for autophagy, from myeloid cell-speci fi c lysozyme M-Cre mice resulted in social behavioral defects and repetitive behaviors, characteristic features of ASDs.

### microglia and independent CX3CL1 mechanisms of action in the BLA / minocycline

The present study revealed that long- term HFD feeding in mice may induce impaired fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the corticolimbic system, leading to defective synaptic plasticity and subsequently to cognitive impairment in DIO mice. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that neuron–microglia interactions, especially those underpinned by fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling, play crucial roles in brain dysfunction associated with obesity.


Considering the key role of microglia in sensing neuronal microenvironment ( Davalos et al., 2005 ), it was not surprising to discover that some of the effects of CXCL16 are also mediated by these cells. <!-- Trettel 2020 --><!-- analogous?-->

However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005). Thus, to determine further whether microglia specifically control synaptic transmission in the BLA, we injected Saporin toxin conjugated to macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1, integrin CD11b/ CD18 receptor localized to microglia) directly into the BLA of 8-week-old C57BL/6N females to transiently deplete microglia. IgG-Saporin, which does not bind to any specific receptor, was used as a control.;;

Therefore, fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling is postulated to represent a primary neuron–glia inter- regulatory system that is important for brain function.18

We have previously shown that another transmembrane chemokine, CX3CL1, induces protection of hippocampal neurons from Glu-induced excitotoxicity with a mechanism mediated by microglia (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). <!-- opposite -->
the inhibition of microglia activation selectively prevented CX3CL1-induced neuroprotection, while CXCL16 was still able to rescue neurons from cell death (Fig. 4 A , n 4–5; p 0.05) indicating that microglia activation is not required for CXCL16-mediated neuroprotection.

microglia -> LTP -> dendritic spines?

The deficiency in microglial CX3CR1 can cause communication defects among neurons, microglia  and astrocytes during numerous c NS diseases or even injuries (Sungho_2010). 
In addition, c X3cL1 activation is correlated with the specific type of neuropathic pain induced by multiple sclerosis  through interaction with cX3cR1 (Zhu_2013). Moreover, the levels of cX3cL1 are potentially regulated by diverse neurotoxic stimuli and its signaling is correlated with several types of  cNS diseases, including HIV infection, epilepsy, and cerebral tumors among other neuropathologies (limatola_2014) [@chen_2020]

 Notably, previous studies demonstrated that  in vitro lipopolysaccharide- and interferon γ-induced release of multiple cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6) in cultured microglia can be effectively suppressed through the activity  of cX3cL1 signaling. 
 This suggests that cX3cL1/cX3cR1  signaling is vital in modulating upstream production and  cytokine release from microglia (limatola_2014), thereby contributing to  the feedback loop as well. By inhibiting the cx3cl1/cX3cR1  pathway, AZd8797 can suppress the role of microglia and astrocytes, thus preventing the development of the inflammatory response (biber_2014, kasama_2010). 
 The present study shows that blocking  the cX3cR1 signaling with AZd8797 results in, not only a more effectively reduced concentration of the inflammatory  cytokine, I L-1β (which is associated with a better recovery after injury), but also lower apoptosis and necrosis levels when  compared to methylprednisolone treatment.

Intriguingly, sole minocycline was able to increase the excitability of pyramidal cells in the BLA.
This result suggests that microglia alone and without stimulation of CX3CR1 receptor<!--using CX3CR1 independent mechanisms?--> may be able to affect excitability of neurons in the BLA.
However, as this molecule alone was previously reported to affect electrophysiological properties, such as...., these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.

We measured mEPSC amplitude and frequency at 	 70 mV after 20–24 h of minocycline treatment. 
We found that minocycline increased mEPSC frequency (), but not amplitude in EAE mice compared with EAE-vehicle-treated mice (). 
Thus, the EAE phenotype is even more apparent after additional microglial inactivation. 
However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (  Brundula et al., 2002  ;  Giuliani et al., 2005  ). [@acharjee_2018]

We found that Mac1Saporin injection increased mEPSC frequency (Saporin: 2.3   0.38 Hz, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 3.5   0.21 Hz; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  2.412, df  14; p  0.03), but not amplitude (Saporin: 16   0.685 pA, n  7, N  3; Mac1-Saporin: 14.8   0.645 pA; n  9, N  4; unpaired two-tailed t test: t  1.278, df  14; p  0.22) compared  with  Saporin-treated  control mice in the BLA (  Fig. 8  E–G ). 
These experiments demonstrate that both inhibiting microglial activation and transiently depleting microglia replicate the increased mEPSC frequency seen in the BLA of early EAE animals.

Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->

However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005)

Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation. However, minocycline also has been reported to directly affect neurons.32,49,50 Multiple lines of evidence have shown the role of minocycline in protecting neurons from apoptosis via inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.30–32,51,52 Our observation of increased neuronal p38 MAPK activity in the CeA raises the possibility that minocycline could have inhibited visceral hypersensitivity through an attenuation of neuronal apoptosis via a direct inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. Therefore, we applied apoptosis analysis in WAS and SHAM animals. - Yuan2020

Generally, the increase in sIPSC or sEPSC frequency enhanced the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the effect of minocycline on SG neurons is mainly of a presynaptic origin rather than a postsynaptic origin

### dose?

At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000; Cambien et al., 2001; Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2009)

While previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 causes an increase in intracellular calcium in neurons and other cell types (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Ragozzino et al., 2006) this effect of CX3CL1 becomes apparent at concentrations of 25 nM and higher (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004), well above the levels we investigated here and we observed no such increase in intracellular calcium. At a concentration of 2 nM, in both neurons and non-neurons, CX3CL1 pre-incubation suppressed glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium levels. These data are in good agreement with previous findings of a protective effect of inflammatory levels of CX3CL1 against glutamate excitotoxicity and glutamate NMDA receptor activation, in particular (Meucci et al., 1998; Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005), although, unlike the current work, the latter effect was linked to increased intracellular calcium (Ragozzino et al., 2006). Calcium oscillations in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells are important for cellular growth, migration and synaptic structural refinement (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Komuro and Rakic, 1998; Spitzer et al., 2000). Thus, the dampening of such signaling by CX3CL1 is suggestive of a role in stability of network connectivity and activity. Overall, the current data along with information in the published literature reveal that a role for CX3CL1 in control of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission during excitotoxic events can be extended to situations of synaptic plasticity required for normal functions such as memory formation.

<!--Neuromodulation?
It should be noted that immune proteins, including CX3CL1, exerts their neuromodulatory role not only by directly acting on GABAergic and glutamatergic systems or neuronal properties, but also indirectly by affecting other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators.
Accordingly, ...
NE - Activation of β -receptors, which seems to be present on both pyramidal cells and interneurons at least in the amygdala (Farb, Chang, & LeDoux, 2010) induces the phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunit thereby lowering the threshold for synaptic delivery of GluA1 containing AMPARs during LTP expression. (Hu et al., 2007). 
Additionally, it has been shown that blocking of β -receptors by propranolol reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs in the LA (Zhou et al., 2015). 
Consequently, a reduced supply of NA in TPH2− / −mice might lead to a decreased phosphorylation of AMPAR GluA1 subunits followed by a reduced surface expression of GluA1 containing AMPARs, which might cause an attenuated LTP expression. from [@gebhardt_2019] 

It is well-known that α2-receptors primarily serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. Activation of α2-receptors exerts inhibition of spontaneous activity (Buffalari & Grace, 2007) probably via inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+channels and activation of inward rectifying K+channels and seems to inhibit both LTP and LTD in the basolateral amygdala (DeBock et al., 2003).

Thus, in mice lacking brain serotonin we found long-term plasticity changes both in the amygdala and in the hippocampus. 
Priming of LTP by prior paired pulse stimulation seemed to compensate the deficits of serotonin in the brain at the level of the functional readout.
-->

<!--glial impact?
By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

<!-- PPR
In PPF (at multiple synapses), the second pair of stimuli separated by a few tens of milliseconds produces a larger synaptic response than the first, owing to the transient elevation of Ca2^+^ in terminal boutons produced by the second stimulus summing with the residual Ca2^+^ produced by the first stimulus, and increasing the probability of transmitter release. 
Since probability of transmitter release cannot exceed 1, the PPF ratio tends to decrease as probability of release increases (Bliss & Collingridge, 2013). 
Therefore, in the LA the glutamate release in response to paired pulse stimulation seems to be reduced in TPH2− / −mice.

### general summary

The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. 
Consistently, disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the BLA causes a disturbance of the excitatory/inhibitory balance and has been implicated in many neurobiological diseases, such as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or epilepsy (for a comprehensive review: @prager_2016).<!-- // original: Pathological disruption of GABA~A~ receptors causes a disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory balance and has been increasingly implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (Deidda et al., 2014) // The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. --><!-- BLA hyperexcitability manifests behaviorally as an increase in anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or development of seizure activity.-->

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

<!--Various chemokines and their receptors are increased in both parenchymal brain cells and leukocytes in human and experimental epilepsy (Cerri et al., 2017; de Vries et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2018).Chemokines, especially CX3CL1, are endowed with neuromodulatory actions which make them potential candidates for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy.zmienić In addition to their role as chemotactic molecules that govern the tissue extravasation of peripheral immune cells, chemokines are endowed with neuromodulatory actions which make them potential candidates for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy.-->

Various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, and understanding their specialized roles is important. 

Yet, our findings do not exclude the neuronal participation in releasing adenosine, thus acting in an autocrine manner, or the adenosine-mediated release of additional neuroprotective factors from glial cells.<!-- analogous-->

It should be noted also that immune proteins, such as TNFalpha or IL-1b do not only exert their effect by modulating synaptic transmission, but also *via* interacting with modulatory systems.<!-- citations--><!-- These cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b, not only exert their excitatory effects via upregulating excitatory synaptic transmission [30, 31], but also regulate neuronal functions via interacting with modulatory systems [32]-->

Here, we report rapid modulatory effects of CX3CL1 on neuronal events in hippocampal tissue. <!--Sheridan2014--> 
Our data does not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons and we cannot discount the possibility that the effects we see on LTP and calcium influx in neuronal cell types happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglial cell types. <!--Sheridan2014-->
If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought. <!--Sheridan2014-->
The evidence from rats that CX3CR1 is expressed on hippocampal neuron allows the possibility that, as is the case for CX3CL1-mediated regulation of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal Raphe, glutamatergic neuron-derived CX3CL1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the hippocampus during periods of synaptic plasticity to regulate glutamate-mediated neurotransmission tone.<!--Sheridan2014-->

We believe that our technique is well suited to investigate changes in BLA morphology and activity, which have been implicated in a number of disease states, including posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction (Koob et al. 2014; Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). 
Posttraumatic stress disorder and other forms of chronic stress are often associated with increases in amygdala activity, resulting in the dysregulation of fear responses and causing sensitization to stressful stimuli (Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). Previous studies have shown that emotional responses generated by the BLA may result from increased excitatory input and changes in glutamate receptor ratios (Christian et al. 2012; Hubert et al. 2014; LeDoux 2003) and repeated restraint stress can cause changes in BLA spine localization (Padival et al. 2013). 
It would be interesting to investigate whether these changes result from altered levels of not only excitatory input but also inhibitory synapses within the BLA and other nuclei within the amygdala. <!-- klenowski_2015-->

Feng et al. found another potential therapy for regulate stress is motilin which can weaken anxiety-like behavior in rats after they have been subjected to forced swimming. Whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices revealed that motilin depolarized the interneurons and promoted GABAergic transmission in the BLA (Feng et al., 2013).

 It is worth noting that the HPA axis can mediate the stress response because it is a neuroendocrine system. Some researchers looked at the effects of rapid glucocorticoid-induced acute stress in the rat BLA. Glucocorticoid administrated to amygdala slices produced a rapid, non-reversible suppression of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents (Di et al., 2016). The acute administration of glucocorticoid receptor agonist DEX also upregulated GABA release and GABAergic neuronal spiking (Wang et al., 2016).
 
 Aroniadou et al. reported a key role of the amygdala’s GABAergic control in epilepsy. The stress-induced damage to the noradrenergic system, promoting GABA release in the BLA, may underlie the stress-induced exacerbation of seizure activity in epileptic patients (Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2007).
 
 A more complete understanding of the intrinsic excitatory/inhibitory circuit balance of the amygdala and how imbalances in inhibitory control contribute to excessive BLA excitability will guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric diseases <!-- ładne conclusion -->
 
 The observed level of somatic variation, dendritic organization, and spine localization is likely to provide important morphological control over the integration of synaptic inputs, which would be expected to influence cellular output and potentially contribute to differences in BLA principal cell physiology.
 
Although a number of brain areas are involved in neuronal circuits activated in the presence of a thread causing fear and anxiety (Belzung, Turiault, & Griebel, 2014; Giustino & Maren, 2015; Tovote, Fadok, & Luthi, 2015), there is a fundamental agreement that LTP-induced changes in synaptic strength in the LA occur during fear learning (Blair, Schafe, Bauer, Rodrigues, & LeDoux, 2001; Maren, 2005; Sah, Westbrook, & Luthi, 2008).
The observed reduction of LTP magnitude after CX3CL1 application might suggests that anxiety vulnerable mice may have difficulty in learning about and predicting when aversive events will occur. 
It has been shown that fear conditioning occludes LTP-induced presynaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission in the cortical pathway to the LA (Mahan & Ressler, 2012). 
Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms of metaplasticity at the molecular level.

## CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a limbic hub involved in autonomic regulation, emotion, and motivated behavior, and has been strongly implicated in opioid dependence (Koob, 2009a; Upadhyay et al., 2010). 

### Cell-specific effects on membrane properties

We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).

Notably, preventing the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons is associated with impaired fear memory formation, and activation of SOMneurons is necessary for fear memory recall and sufficient to drive fear responses.

### Paralleled by decreased frequency of sIPSC onto Late-Firing neurons

IS might be seen often in Vip cells as a result of their high input resistance, which increases the possibility that noise, an intrinsic subthreshold oscillation, or a small synaptic input will produce sufficient depolarization to reach spike threshold. <!-- but we have decreased input resistance, BUT depolarized...-->


Further work is required to determine whether Late-Firing cells specifically express CX3CR1 receptor by some more <!--czuły-->methods such as ..... <!-- analogous -->

In this study, the identity (that is, ON or OFF cell, PKCδ+ or PKCδ−) of the CeL neurons activated by BLA terminal optical stimulation was not determined.

This influence can be assumed to increase reciprocal interactions between CElon and CEloff pathways, thereby boosting the medial CE (CEm) output pathway and contributing to the anxiogenic-like action of SP in the amygdala.

In rats subjected to restraint stress, acute application of corticotropin releasing factor significantly increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the CeA (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014).

Rats subjected to repeated corticosterone administration showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior, examined using the open field test. The behavioral effects caused by corticosterone injections may because of increased expression of c-Fos in the LA and CeA nuclei of the amygdala and decreased GABAA a -2 subunit density in the CeA of these rats (Skórzewska et al., 2015). These findings are consistent with those of another study (Lussier et al., 2013). Liu et al. (2014) suggested that a lasting loss of tonic but not phasic GABAA receptor currents severely contributes to the prolonged amygdala disinhibition observed after chronic stress.


 In fact, GABAergic control of the amygdala is mostly relevant to anxiety. Some animal researches have shown that administration of corticosterone into the CeA can induce anxiety-like behavior. This animal model imitate the depressed effect of chronic stress on GABAergic tonic inhibition in LA (Myers et al., 2005). There are also some studies that show an association between the amygdala’s GABA interneuronal network and alcohol addiction (Nie et al., 2004, 2009; Bajo et al., 2008). 

We would expect higher proportion of co-localization between SOM-positive and CX3CR1-expressing neurons. 
However, as there is no specific marker of Regular-Spiking neurons, the single-cell RT-PCR ? transcriptome.... ? new method
No tendency of co-localization of SOM+-expressing neurons 



A handful of studies have utilized CX3CR1-deficient mice to explore the role of this receptor in chronic stress, regarding its regulation by stress (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017), its importance for microglial morphological ramification and phagocytosis (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017), and its beneficial versus detrimental role in brain and behavioral responses to physio-pathological (Gunner et al., 2019; Lowery et al., 2017; Schecter et al., 2017) or psychosocial stressors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Winkler et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2013).
Among these, studies have showed that CX3CR1 rescued chronic stress-induced increase in microglial phagocytosis (Milior et al., 2016) and decrease in hippocampal long-term potentiation (Milior et al., 2016), while improving neurogenesis and short-term memory (Rimmerman et al., 2017).
CX3CR1-deficiency caused social withdrawal and increased repetitive behavior (Zhan et al., 2014), as well as increased fear acquisition and reinstatement (Schubert et al., 2018), implicating a beneficial function of CX3CR1 for the stressed brain. 
However, other studies showed that CX3CR1-deficient mice were resistant to chronic stress-induced depressive-like and anxiety behaviors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2017), jointly implying a detrimental role of CX3CR1 in psychiatric disorders.

We also observed the regional heterogeneity of microglia and its potential importance for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders (Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020; Xuan et al., 2019). [@paiirainen_2021]
