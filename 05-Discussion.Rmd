the probability of neurotransmitter release was either increased, decreased or remained constant as a consequence of a differential presynaptic activity. In the connectivity context it is rather interesting that a presynaptic neuron responsible of a given synaptic strength forms synaptic connections with different neurons and, conversely that the same postsynaptic neuron was contacted by different types of synaptic connec- tions formed by different presynaptic cells. Furthermore, this functional heterogeneity is further supported by the finding that presynaptic neurons forming synapses having a different synaptic weights display a different axonal pattern.

Here, we report rapid modulatory effects of CX3CL1 on neuronal events in hippocampal tissue. Our data does not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons and we cannot discount the possibility that the effects we see on LTP and calcium influx in neuronal cell types happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglial cell types. If this is true, however, the ability of microglia to rapidly regulate multiple hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes may be much more extensive than traditionally thought. The evidence from rats that CX3CR1 is expressed on hippocampal neuron allows the possibility that, as is the case for CX3CL1-mediated regulation of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal Raphe, glutamatergic neuron-derived CX3CL1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the hippocampus during periods of synaptic plasticity to regulate glutamate-mediated neurotransmission tone.-Sheridan2014

Generally, the increase in sIPSC or sEPSC frequency enhanced the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the effect of minocycline on SG neurons is mainly of a presynaptic origin rather than a postsynaptic origin

Neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic
terminal is triggered by a Na+ channel-dependent action potential, a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the somatodendritic region, and presynaptic ligand- gated channel activation. For example, an endogenous peptide antisecretory factor reduced the frequency of sIPSCs, but not mIPSCs, in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Strandberg et al., 2014). Likewise, if an increase in sIPSC frequency is triggered by a Na+ channel- dependent action potential, then the Na+ channel blocker TTX should block the effect of minocycline. In contrast, the increase in mIPSC frequency induced by minocycline was not blocked by bath application of TTX. It has been demonstrated that Na+ channels, which account for action potential propagation expressed in lamina I/II of the spinal cord, are entirely TTX-sensitive (Hildebrand et al., 2011). Therefore, our results together with the pub- lished literature suggest that a Na+ channel-dependent action potential is not involved in the effect of minocycline on inhibitory transmission. It remains unclear whether a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the soma- todendritic region contributes to minocycline response. We next investigated whether glutamate receptor- mediated sEPSCs are involved in the increase in GABA and glycine release. Our data show that the effect of minocycline under the treatment with CNQX and APV was the same as with TTX. Therefore, it is possible that the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmitter release is due to presynaptic ligand-gated channel activation. The spontaneous synaptic neurotransmitter release of dorsal horn neurons relies critically on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (Bourinet et al., 2014).- Peng2016

Minocycline is used commonly to inhibit microglial activation. However, minocycline also has been reported to directly affect neurons.32,49,50 Multiple lines of evidencehave shown the role of minocycline in protecting neuronsfrom apoptosis via inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.30â€“32,51,52Our observation of increased neuronal p38 MAPK activityin the CeA raises the possibility that minocycline could haveinhibited visceral hypersensitivity through an attenuation ofneuronal apoptosis via a direct inhibition of p38 MAPK ac-tivity. Therefore, we applied apoptosis analysis in WAS andSHAM animals. - Yuan2020

These features are concordant with an increased number of synapses, an interpretation supported by our Golgi stains where we found a greater density of dendritic spines in EAE mice. A parallel increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and change in AMPAR dynamics is also consistent with an increase in the number of mature functional synapses and dendritic spines in response to EAE induction (Danglot et al., 2012; Hanse et al., 2013). **It is thought that new spines are associated with more AMPARs compared with NMDA receptors (Zito et al., 2009).** The AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).- Acharjee2018b


The present data are not sufficient to explain the difference we observed in LTD suppression during mouse development. It could be related to changes in chemokine receptor density, such as those described in terminally  differentiated  human  neurons  in   comparison  with  the  undifferentiated  precursors   Hesselgesser  et  al., . 1997 ,  though PN sensitivity   estimated with fluorescence .. determinations   to chemokines in adult   2-month old   and . young   2-week old   mice was comparable - Giovanelli_1999
