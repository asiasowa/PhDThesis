## CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect principal cells' excitability, as well as  excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were observed. 
In particular, presented results indicated that following CXCL12 treatment: (i) there was a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells (especially at a higher concentration), (ii) there was a complex pattern of neuronal responses manifested as the frequency of sEPSC,<!--dziwnie napisane--> and (iii) there were opposing trends of CXCL12-mediated regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission depending on the chemokine concentration. 
<!-- The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is in line with a previous report demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus of the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a], at least considering sensitivity and the detection level needed for *in situ* hybridization 20 years ago. nienajlepsze zdanie-->

CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation [@yang_2016].
Nevertheless, it demonstrated neuronal expression of the CXCR4 receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA under physiological conditions.
The authors further suggested that the latter effect might lead to the increased excitability of pyramidal-like neurons.<!-- However, these results are in contrast with studies conducted by , revealing that CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.-->
Their hypothesis is supported by the results presented in this PhD dissertation.
However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward.
In particular, the study by @yang_2016 revealed that the application of CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.
In contrast, results presented here showed that CXCL12(2nM) enhanced sEPSC frequency in `r pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2]` out of `r (pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[3])` neurons, while reducing this parameter in `r pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1]` out of `r (pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[3])` cells.
Thus, grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs.
These neuronal proportions were also similar when a higher concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied.
Different experimental settings may explain this discrepancy between studies.
Firstly, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed by @yang_2016 in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using slices obtained from male Wistar rats.
The difference between those animals was reported in many contexts.<!-- lepiej napisać-->

Moreover, while the present study was performed on the coronal slices, transverse slices containing the amygdala were used in the study by @yang_2016.
Accordingly, the entorhinal, perirhinal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala are heavily interconnected and implicated in memory; most of the connections known from *in vivo* studies were preserved in the horizontal slices [@halbach_2002]. 
Given that those connections are excitatory, it raises the possibility that  the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices might be, at least in part, due to more preserved and dense connections between those crucial structures, which were absent from coronal slices.<!-- The present study increases our understanding of which hippocampal pathways are best preserved in the three most common brain slice preparations, and will help investigators determine the appropriate slices to use for physiological studies depending on the subregion of interest.--> 
<!--The temperature, which is the critical factor for recording the synaptic transmission, also differs between these two studies.
Here, brain slices were submerged with the ACSF at the temperature of 31–33`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, whereas the excitatory synaptic transmission in experiments by @yang_2016 was recorded at room temperature.potwierdzenie-->

Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF, @yang_2016 sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a blocker of GABA~A~ receptors, picrotoxin.
Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in @yang_2016 study was distorted by the modulation of the GABAergic heterogeneous group of local interneurons.
Given the well-known tight regulation of principal cell activity by local interneurons<!--citations-->, along with documented CXCL12 mediation of GABAergic transmission<!--citations-->, this explanation is possible.
<!-- jeszcze coś o excitability?-->
Nevertheless, whether blocking GABA~A~ receptors will result in a significant CXCL12-mediated increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the BLA and/or enhancing their firing in rat coronal acute slices remains to be confirmed.

In line with this hypothesis, there is a trend in the CXCL12-triggered changes in the frequency of sIPSC, although not statistically significant.<!--lepiej napisać-->
Specifically, bath administration of CXCL12 produced two distinct responses: while exogenous CXCL12 at the concentration of 2nM was shown to reduce the frequency of sIPSC, the increased number of these events were observed following treatment with a higher concentration of this chemokine (5nM).<!--bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically-->

These observations are in good agreement with what happens in MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA), where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects depending on the concentration used [@guyon_2005].<!-- nie wiem czy bardziej nie zmienić... This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the LHA, where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration ( Guyon et al., 2005a ).// SDF-1α often appears to have opposite effects on neuronal function depending on the concentration. For example, in DA neurons, at low concentrations, it acts as a neuromodulator by potentiating K+-induced DA secretion and HVA calcium currents, whereas at higher concentration, it decreases DA release and HVA calcium currents. This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, where SDF-1α also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration (Guyon et al. 2005b). Moreover, this can also be observed in other contexts, for example, low levels of SDF-1 (<100 ng/ml) are attractive, whereas higher levels (>1 μg/ml) are repulsive for T cells (Zlatopolskiy & Laurence 2001). Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, are reviewed in Fig. 3. -->
Specifically, CXCL12 at 0.1-1 nM decreased peak and discharge frequency of action potential evoked by current pulses, whereas at the concentration of 10nM, CXCL12 induced the opposite actions.
Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed [@guyon_2007].<!-- Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, are reviewed in Guyon and Nahon (2007) . sprawdzić skąd to... -->

Firstly, the characteristic U-shaped dose-dependent effect curve is commonly displayed in signaling molecules, including chemokines.<!-- chemokines usually display a U-shaped dose-dependent effect curve, suggesting opposing functions depending on their concentration. // może GPCR receptors?--> 
Such a process, known as ‘hormesis’, relates to adaptive responses to compensate for disruption in homeostasis by overshooting homeostatic feedback controls (for reviews: @mattson_2008 and @rostne_2011a).

In addition, CXCL12 was shown to be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment.
This metabolite was reported to exert its action independent of the CXCR4 receptor [@zhang_2003].<!--Indeed, it has been shown that CXCL12 can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment, namely CXCL12 a (5–67), that exerts its effect through a G-protein coupled receptor distinct from CXCR4 (Zhang et al ., 2003). sprawdzić skąd to... -->
Accordingly, the enhancement of sIPSC frequency observed at higher concentrations of CXCL12 could be mediated by a CXCL12 metabolite produced in the acute brain slice.<!--These effects could overcome the CXCR4 effects.zmienić NA SZCZĘŚCIE NIE BLOKOWAŁAM TEGO :D-->
<!-- This may be due to concentration reached during inflammatory conditions, /// compensatory mechanism

Given that the upregulated GABAergic transmission in the BLA is implicated in animal models of neuropsychiatric diseases, further experiments using specific MPP inhibitors should clarify this point [@guyon_2005].<!--zmienić-->

Another possibility is that different concentrations might act on different cell types. 
This mechanism was previously reported regarding a different chemokine, CX3CL1, in the hippocampus [@sheridan_2014].<!-- sheridan - glia vs neurons different concentration However unlikely as yang_2016 did not detect the CXCR4 expression in the astrocyte. A MY?! Probably OR MAYBE MICROGLIA. /// The dif-ferential responses of CX3CL1 on neurons and non-neurons at thelower concentration (500 pM) may relate to variations in absolute levels of CX3CR1 receptor expression on distinct cell populationsin the hippocampus.-->
Notably, considering that no CXCR4-expressing astrocytes were observed in the BLA [@yang_2016], together with the known expression of CXCR4 in microglial cells [@tanabe_1997], it might be conceivable that the concentration needed to activate CXCR4 on microglial might be different from neuronal cells. 
Thus, this issue warrants further investigation.
<!-- probably microglia - release of some signaling molecule? analogous to what is seen in adenosine? --><!--In conclusion, our results show that CX3CL1 may affect glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus by a mechanism involving three different AR subtypes, raising the proposal that opposite regulation might be achieved by chemokine action at single synapses, depending on AR distribution and functional status and, potentially, by the site and mechanism of adenosine release.analogous // Piccinin 2010-->

Moreover, in addition to CXCR4, CXCL12 is known to act through another atypical receptor, ACKR3 [@levoye_2009].
Recently, increasing evidence has shown the ACKR3-modulated action of CXCL12 in many brain structures [@fumagalli_2020; @meyrath_2020; @puchert_2017].<!--rozwinąć ? including? -->
Nevertheless, to date, no ACKR3 has been detected in the amygdala [@schnemeier_2008], suggesting that this explanation is unlikely.


Altogether, the subtle CXCL12-modulated changes on synaptic excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission might be related to heterogenous groups of principal cells and/or interneurons and/or by using coronal slices which were mostly devoid of important hippocampal and coronal inputs.
Nevertheless, this study raises the possibility that CXCL12 might modulate the local inhibitory synaptic transmission in the BLA in an opposing manner depending on the concentration used.
This is similar to what was observed in other structures and supports the notion that CXCL12 might exert either a neuroprotective or neurotoxic role based on its concentration.

## CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

This dissertation provides new evidence for the neuromodulatory properties of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in synaptic transmission and membrane properties in the lateral subdivision of the central complex of the amygdala.
Firstly, CXCL12 was shown to modulate the excitability of CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably without the astrocytic involvement.
Moreover, the frequency of excitatory synaptic currents was increased at the higher concentration (5nM) only in the Regular-Spiking cells. 
Finally, the treatment with CXCL12 also led to the opposite regulation of GABAergic transmission, based on the subtype of CeL neurons, which was possibly influenced by astrocytes.

CXCL12 was shown to increase the excitability of CeL neurons.
While a decreased threshold current was observed in both Late-Firing and Regular-Spiking neurons, the Late-Firing neurons displayed additional decreased gain.<!--i co to może znaczyć?-->
Thus, as a response to increasing depolarizing steps, after CXCL12 application, those neurons were more excitable and needed smaller current injections but produced fewer spikes during higher injections.<!--lepiej napisać --> 
The CXCR4 receptor contributed to the observed effects, as the presence of AMD3100 prevented the CXCL12-mediated enhancement in CeL neuronal excitability.

Interestingly, AMD3100 alone was shown an opposite trend, suggesting tonic activity of CXCR4 in the CeL neurons.
This phenomenon was previously reported in granule neurons precursors in the DG by using pharmacological, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological approaches [@bhattacharyya_2008; @kolodziej_2008; @stumm_2002; @stumm_2003].<!--by @kolodziej_2008, where intraventricular infusion of AMD3100 dramatically increased CXCR4 protein expression in subgranular neurons in the DG, suggesting that CXCR4 is tonically activated and downregulated by endogenous CXCL12./// While Cxcr4 is silenced in most differentiated cells, its expression persists in the SGZ. 
CXCL12 is postnatally upregulated in mature granule neurons and pharmacological, immunohistochemical as well as electrophysiological approaches suggest that CXCR4 is tonically activated in granule neuron precursors by local CXCL12 (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Berger et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008; Kolodziej et al., 2008; Choe and Pleasure, 2012).-->
The own effects of AMD3100 when applied alone were also observed in MCH neurons in the LHA [@eggermann_2003], where the CXCR4 was suggested to be tonically inhibited, resulting in the hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions<!--, as compared to CXCR4-derived orexin neurons in the LHA--> [@eggermann_2003].<!-- Low concentrations of CXCL12 exert a tonic inhibition on MCH neurons, which are known to have a hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions, as compared to orexin neurons of the LHA which are in intrinsic state of membrane depolarization and lack CXCR4 expression (Eggermann et al., 2003). In addition, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 has its own effects when applied alone which suggests that a tonic activation of CXCR4 occurs, at least in slices preparations, and that low levels of CXCL12 are secreted under basal conditions (although the slice preparation could also be considered as an inflammatory state).[@guyon_2014]--><!--Given that tonic activation of CXCR4 by SDF1 leads to internalization of both chemokine and receptor (Burger and Kipps, 2006), it is entirely possible that the constitutive release of neuronal SDF1 and subsequent neuronal signaling via CXCR4 may result in diminished evidence of CXCR4-IR in the sensory ganglia of morphine treated rats (Fig. 6C). This event would not be unlike previous reports in the dentate gyrus (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008, Kolodziej et al., 2008).-->

<!--However, increased excitability is documented to results either from increasing amplitude of N-type calcium channel or inducing inward rectifier (GIRK) potassium currents, the action mediated by CXC12/CXCR4 axis. zmienić, citation-->
<!--GIRK or N-type calcium channel in CeA neurons?-->
<!--The activation of the GIRK current could have been mediated directly through CXCR4 activation or through the activation of metabotropic glutamate and ⁄ or GABAB receptors, as SDF-1 a increases glutamate and GABA release in the slice. GIRK current in the amygdala? GABA B in the amygdala?? 
Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.
In conclusion, the SDF-1 a -induced hyperpolarization is likely linked to the activation of a GIRK current via stimulation of CXCR4
-->

Moreover, the pre-incubation slices with an astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, did not abolish the CXCL12-triggered increase in neuronal excitability, suggesting that astrocytes did not mediate this effect.
This raises the possibility that similar to the BLA and the SN [@guyon_2006; @yang_2016], astrocytes in the CeA might also lack the CXCR4 receptors.
However, further studies employing immunostaining methods are necessary to verify this hypothesis.
<!--This is in line with presented immunofluorescence data demonstrating the absence of CXCR4 in astrocytes. pokazuje? ;/ -->


Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, a complex trend was observed. 
<!-- może tutaj zdanie o tym że działa na transmisję w innych strukturach? patrz niżej ale nie wiem jakie efekty -->
At 2nM, CXCL12 was shown to reduce the frequency of sEPSC onto more than 50% of Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the elevated frequency of sEPSC was observed during 5nM CXCL12 treatment.<!--POPRAWIĆ-->
Moreover, this effect was prominent in Regular-Spiking neurons, while no relevant differences in the excitatory synaptic transmission were observed onto Late-Firing cells. 
This is in line with a study showing that PVT neurons preferentially innervated SOM-positive neurons in CeL [@penzo_2015], which is in good agreement with the observed enhancement of excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons.<!--poprawić i cytowanie // PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM+ neurons in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM+ neuron activity and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear learning and expression5,6-->
Moreover, since the higher concentration of CXCL12 showed a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that their elevated activity is reflected by upregulated excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons.
Although BLA direct glutamatergic projections to CeL have been well-established [@ciocchi_2010; @krettek_1978; @li_2013a; @pitknen_1997], differences in the type of their target neurons remain unclear.<!-- może nie unclear..... prefer Regular-Spiking or SOM-expressing neurons -->
However, given the anxiolytic effect of optogenetic stimulation of the BLA`r knitr::asis_output("\U2192")`CeL pathway [@tye_2011], the cell type-specific differences have been speculated [@fadok_2018].<!--Because optogenetic stimulation of the pathway between the BLA and CEl can also have anxiolytic effects [ 12 ], it could be that glutamatergic BLA inputs to the CEl target different cell types, and that depending on stimulation parameters, different behavioral responses could be induced-->
Importantly, based on the concentration (2nM vs. 5nM), CXCL12 produced an opposite trend towards  decreased or increased frequency of excitatory synaptic events. 
This may be reflected by the findings reporting that principal cells preferentially innervate Late-Firing neurons in the baseline condition, whereas following fear-conditioning, this pattern changes  [@li_2013a].
In accordance with these observations, considering that the higher concentration of 5nM could be considered inflammatory, the differences in the concentration of CXCL12 might reflect a similar pattern.  
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CXCL12 at the 5nM might mimic changes associated with fear conditioning. 
However, further research will be required to independently replicate these findings and further investigate the mechanism of this effect.

<!--relevance fear
BLA can influence CEm via direct glutamatergic projections9,10,11,16 and through indirect di-synaptic routes involving the glutamatergic excitation of GABAergic intercalated (ITC)16 or central lateral (CEl) neurons9,10,11 that project to CEm10,11,16,17.///
Specifically, fear conditioning strengthens excitatory synapses onto neurons expressing the peptide hormone somatostatin(SOM+)/PKCd  neurons, which largely correspond to CeLONunits, while weakening those synapsing onto SOM  /PKC d + neurons in the CeL, which largely correspond to CeLOFFunits.-->

<!--It has been suggested that in the context of fear conditioning, CeL~ON~ cells (mostly Regular-Firing cells), like CeM neurons, receives direct excitatory inputs from auditory cortex [@ciocchi_2010].(+ linke_2000) // The short onset latency of CS-evoked excitation in CElon neurons (<15 ms) indicates that they may, like CEm neurons22,23, receive direct input from sensory thalamus24.--> 

As documented previously, CXCL12 was revealed to increase glutamate release in the cerebellum and hypothalamus [@guyon_2005; @ragozzino_1998].
<!-- Guyon_2006
Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12. However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12. 
It is therefore likely that CXCL12 induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). 
Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. 
The mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.-->

Since CeL neurons are highly interconnected, one could speculate that the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Spiking cells and elevated excitability would lead to more increased GABAergic transmission within CeL.<!--lepiej napisać, ale tak --> 
In contrast, at the concentration of 5nM, the median frequency of sIPSCs is increased in the Regular-Spiking cells, whereas Late-Firing cells were shown to display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs.
All of these effects were mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in the presence of AMD3100.
In addition, they were also absent in the presence of TTX and an astrocytic toxin.
A similar dual effect on GABAergic transmission in the CeL was described for another immune protein, IL-1`r knitr::asis_output("\U03B2")`.
These observations suggest that the CXCL12-mediated actions on GABAergic transmission are multifaceted, which might be a common characteristic among immune proteins.<!--lepiej napisać -->
It is speculated that they are modulated by both the GABAergic and astrocytic networks.
The mechanisms of astrocytic modulation of the CeL microcircuit have recently attracted much attention.<!--citations-->
It would, then, be interesting to test whether CXCL12 acute application led to opposing effects in those two subpopulations in the CeL by using dual patch-clamp experiments.
<!-- It would, then, be interesting to test if astrocytes are important to OT  signaling in other brain regions, and, if they are, if the same mechanisms of astrocyte-to-neuron communication are at stake.-->
<!-- Maybe only neuronal CXCR4 activity is tonic.
However, it is important to note that if only astrocytes were involved in this effect.
Noting that this effect was sensitive to TTX, it -->

<!--As mentioned previously, CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->

<!-- Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].

In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018]. -->

<!-- Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].

It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis. --><!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->

<!-- analogous // Moreover, although the results of the present study add another piece to the growing body of evidence that ACKR3 is unable to trigger G protein signaling, it cannot be excluded that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 could induce G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019]. // oreover, although several studies did not detect ACKR3 receptor in the amygdala, it cannot be excluded that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 could, at least partially, mediate observed here effects of CXCL12.-->

## Limitations

A few limitations in the presented study should be acknowledged. <!-- This  approach  was  preferred in this instance to more approximate recording conditions.-->
<!-- First, using immunofluorescence to localize receptors is pretty difficult and thus sometimes leads to inconclusive data. 
Therefore, results from these studies should be treated as preliminary results, and more sensitive methods should be used, such as RNA-scope [@kharchenko_2021] or RNA-sequencing transcriptome [@zhang_2014].due to technical/methodological implication of difficulties regarding immunofluorescent stainings of receptors and imperfections of many antibodies, the results concerning co-localization needs to be verified by using more sensitive methods, such as RNA-scope or .... -->
The presented results reveal that both chemokines mainly modulated the amygdala's neuronal firing and/or GABAergic transmission. 
It should be noted that during whole-cell patch-clamp recording, the cytoplasm of recorded neurons is dialyzing with an intrapipette solution. 
Thus, it might affect intracellular signaling machinery, and thereby, affect cellular excitability.<!-- Soluble components that influence cellular excitability and contribute to signaling pathways are dialyzed from the cell. One frequently encountered consequence is that receptor-mediated responses and/or ionic currents that require soluble second messengers are absent or rapidly “run down” during conventional whole-cell recordings (3, 4). Furthermore, intracellular ion concentrations are disrupted, hampering efforts to determine physiologically relevant responses or properties of channels and receptors (5, 6).-->
A gramicidin perforated patch technique would be a better option to avoid this issue, as it maintains a relatively intact intracellular milieu [@akaike_1994; @akaike_1996]. 
Nevertheless, this should not affect presented results, as the reported effects are eliminated in the pre-incubation with blockers of receptors, suggesting that they are specific.   

Another issue is that the lack of prominent effects on excitatory synaptic transmission by chosen chemokines despite observed tendencies might be related to the use of coronal slices instead of horizontal sections.<!-- plane-->
Thus, the hippocampal and cortex connections, which are essential inputs to the amygdala, are absent in the coronal slices used in this study.<!--citations-->

Next, although widely used, the pharmacological inhibition of either microglia or astrocytes might not be highly specific. 
Further dissection of local communication between astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the context of chemokines' modulation will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions.
The optogenetic technique allows for precise temporal (e.g., milliseconds) and spatial (e.g., specific cells types) light activation, thereby modulating cellular excitability, highlighting specificity and bidirectionally.<!-- Light activation of these proteins modulates cellular excitability with millisecond precision. //  Comparison of electrical and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, highlighting cellular specificity and bidirectionality of optogenetic techniques// The exact dissection of these parallel actions will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions. 
-->

Finally, the GABA~C~ receptor has also been implicated in the regulation of anxiety in the amygdala, and its action should be isolated in experiments [@cunha_2010].
