## CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect principal cells' excitability, excitatory, or inhibitory synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were noted. 
In particular, results presented here indicated that following CXCL12 treatment: (i) there was a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells (especially at higher concentration), (ii) there was a complex pattern of neuronal responses manifested as frequency of sEPSC, and (iii) there were opposing trends of CXCL12-mediated regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission depending on the chemokine concentration. 
<!-- The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is in line with a previous report demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus of the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a], at least considering sensitivity and the detection level needed for *in situ* hybridization 20 years ago. nienajlepsze zdanie-->

CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation [@yang_2016].
Nevertheless, this report demonstrated neuronal expression of CXCR4 receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement in the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.
The authors further suggested that the latter effect might result in the increased excitability of pyramidal-like neurons.<!-- However, these results are in contrast with studies conducted by , revealing that CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.-->
Their hypothesis is supported by results presented in this PhD dissertation.
However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward.
In particular, the study by @yang_2016 revealed that the application of CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.
In contrast, results presented here showed that CXCL12(2nM) led to the enhancement of sEPSC frequency in `r pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2]` out of `r (pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[3])` neurons, while reducing this parameter in `r pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1]` out of `r (pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[1] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[2] + pie_BLA_c2_freq$data$count[3])` cells (Fig. \@ref(fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq)a and b1).
Thus, grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs.
These neuronal proportions were also similar when higher concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied (Fig.\@ref(fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq)a and b2).
This discrepancy between studies may be explained by different experimental settings.
Firstly, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments performed by @yang_2016 in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using slices obtained from male Wistar rats.
The difference between those animals were reported in many contexts.<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Moreover, while in the present studies the coronal slices were used, transverse slices containing the amygdala were reported to be used in the study by @yang_2016.
Accordingly, the terminals from hippocampus and cortex, two sources of excitatory inputs into the BLA, are more intact in transverse slices.<!-- potwierdzenie-->
This raises the possibility that the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices may be, at least in part, due to additional hippocampal and/or cortical inputs, which are absent in coronal slices.<!-- The present study increases our understanding of which hippocampal pathways are best preserved in the three most common brain slice preparations, and will help investigators determine the appropriate slices to use for physiological studies depending on the subregion of interest.--> 
The temperature, which is the critical factor for recording the synaptic transmission, also differs between these two studies.
Here, brain slices were submerged with the ACSF at the temperature of 31–33`r knitr::asis_output("\U00B0")`C, whereas the excitatory synaptic transmission in experiments by @yang_2016 was recorded at room temperature.<!--potwierdzenie-->
Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF, @yang_2016 sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a blocker of GABA~A~ receptors, picrotoxin.
Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in @yang_2016 study, here was distorted by the modulation of GABAergic heterogeneous group of local interneurons.
Given the well-known tight regulation of principal cell's activity by local interneurons<!--citations-->, along with documented CXCL12 mediation of GABAergic transmission<!--citations-->, this explanation is very likely.
<!-- jeszcze coś o excitability?-->
Nevertheless, whether blocking GABA~A~ receptors will result in a significant increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the BLA and/or clearly in enhancement of their firing in rat coronal acute slices remains to be confirmed.

### sIPSC/ GABA/ INTERNEURONS

Consistent with this notion, although not statistically significant, there is a trend in the CXCL12-triggered changes in the frequency of sIPSC.<!--lepiej napisać-->
Specifically, bath administration of CXCL12 produced two distinct responses: while exogenous CXCL12 at the concentration of 2nM was shown to reduce the frequency of sIPSC, the increased number of these events were observed following treatment with higher concentration of this chemokine (5nM; see Fig. \@ref(fig:CXCL12BLAsIPSCfreq).<!--bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically-->

These observations can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the LHA, where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects depending on the concentration used [@guyon_2005].<!-- nie wiem czy bardziej nie zmienić...

In addition, CXCL12 was shown to be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment, namely CXCL12 a (5–67).
This metabolite was reported to exert its action through a receptor different from CXCR4 (Zhang et al ., 2003).<!--Indeed, it has been shown that CXCL12 can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment, namely CXCL12 a (5–67), that exerts its effect through a G-protein coupled receptor distinct from CXCR4 (Zhang et al ., 2003). sprawdzić skąd to... -->
Accordingly, the enhancement of sIPSC frequency observed at higher concentrations of CXCL12 could be mediated by a CXCL12 metabolite produced in the acute brain slice.<!--These effects could overcome the CXCR4 effects.zmienić NA SZCZĘŚCIE NIE BLOKOWAŁAM TEGO :D-->

## CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

<!--Herein, the new evidence for the neuromodulatory properties of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in synaptic transmission and membrane properties in the lateral subdivision of the central complex of the amygdala is provided. previously we provide... pomyśleć o czymś lepszym--> 
Firstly, CXCL12 was shown to upregulate the excitability of CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably without astrocytic involvement.
Next, there was a cell-specific trend illustrating the opposing CXCL12-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission based on the concentration, specifically onto Regular-Spiking neurons.
Finally, the treatment with CXCL12 also led to opposite regulation of GABAergic transmission, based on the subtype of CeL neurons, which was possibly dependent on astrocytes.

### Excitability

CXCL12 was shown to increase the excitability of CeL neurons.
While Late-Firing neurons were shown to have both decreased threshold current and gain, only threshold current was decreased in the Regular-Firing neurons.
<!-- Slightly different mechanism? -->
These effects were mediated by CXCR4 receptor, as the presence of AMD3100 prevented this enhancement in CeL neuronal excitability.
Interestingly, AMD3100 alone was shown in an opposite trend.
Thus, these findings suggest tonic activity of CXCR4.
<!-- tonic activity -->
<!--However, increased excitability is documented to results either from increasing amplitude of N-type calcium channel or inducing inward rectifier (GIRK) potassium currents, the action mediated by CXC12/CXCR4 axis. zmienić, citation-->
<!--GIRK or N-type calcium channel in CeA neurons?-->
<!--The activation of the GIRK current could have been mediated directly through CXCR4 activation or through the activation of metabotropic glutamate and ⁄ or GABAB receptors, as SDF-1 a increases glutamate and GABA release in the slice. GIRK current in the amygdala? GABA B in the amygdala?? 
Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.
In conclusion, the SDF-1 a -induced hyperpolarization is likely linked to the activation of a GIRK current via stimulation of CXCR4
-->

Moreover, the pre-incubation slices with astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, did not abolish CXCL12-triggered increase in neuronal excitability, suggesting that astrocytes did not mediate this effect.
This is in line with our immunofluorescent data demonstrating the absence of CXCR4 in astrocytes.
Similarly, other studies reported the CXCL12-mediated neuromodulation accompanied by the lack of astrocytic CXCR4 in the BLA and in ....<!--citation-->.



### sEPSC
The opposing trend was observed.
RS - 2nM - decreased frequency of sEPSC
RS - 5nM - increased frequency of sEPSC <!-- Guyon_2006
CXCL12 increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). // dawka....
This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. ... u nas blokowane
Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices.
Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12. However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12. 
It is therefore likely that CXCL12 induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). 
Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. 
The mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.-->

Since RS and LF cells were reported to be highly interconnected between each other, than within their subpopulations<!--citation-->, these data would suggest that increased frequency of sEPSC onto RS cells, consistent with the decreased threshold current, increased their firing, and in turn, regarding their GABAergic nature, would inhibit LF neurons. 
On the other hand, the observed trendily inhibition of the frequency of sEPSC is not accompanied by the reduction in their excitability and reduced inputs onto Late-Firing cells.
Nevertheless, experiments by using dual patch-clamp experiments to record whether CXCL12 acute application led to opposing effects in those two subpopulations in the CeL would be of high importance.

In addition - the source of increased inputs onto Regular-Spiking neurons?

### sIPSC

The effect of CXCL12 onto GABAergic synaptic transmission is complex.
While it increases frequency of sIPSC onto Regular-Spiking neurons, Late-Firing neurons were shown to display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSC.
WHY cell specific?<!-- astrocytes are cell specific? -->
Dose?
All of these effects were mediated by CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in the presence of AMD3100.
The tonic activity of CXCR4 seems to not affect GABAergic transmission.
Astrocytes modulates this effect.
Maybe only neuronal CXCR4 activity is tonic.
However, it is important to note that if only astrocytes were involved in this effect, thus why it is sensitive to TTX?

<!--As mentioned previously, CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->






### astrocytes 

Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].

In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018].

Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].

It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis. <!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->

In this study, we found that intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced anxiety-like behaviors in adult mice as measured by elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and open field test (OFT). 
Astrocytes were responsible for CXCL12 induction upon LPS challenge in hippocampus and amygdala, and microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala induced mice anxiety-like behaviors. AMD3100,

AMD3100, which is an antagonist for CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, prevented the anxiety behaviors induced by microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala as well as injection i.p of LPS. Knockdown of CXCR4 expression in neurons using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) significantly blocked anxiety behaviors mediated by CXCL12 i.c injection.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the neurons of basolateral amygdala (BLA) revealed that CXCL12 enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the amygdala. AMD3100 inhibited the excitatory glutamatergic neural transmission and involved in the development of anxiety through CXCR4. These findings provide direct evidence that alterations of CXCL12 in BLA play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety.

In this study, we demonstrated that LPS induced mice anxiety behaviors which was mediated through CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction, and this effect was further confirmed using the antagonist AMD3100 and shRNA for CXCR4. Perfusion brain slice containing amygdala with CXCL12 led to a pronounced induction in the sEPSC frequency which resulted in the hyperexcitability of the neurons in amygdala.

## Limitations

A few limitations in presented study should be acknowledged. <!-- This  approach  was  preferred in this instance to more approximate recording conditions.-->
First, 

* due to technical/methodological implication of difficulties regarding immunofluorescent stainings of receptors and imperfections of many antibodies, the results concerning co-localization needs to be verified by using more sensitive methods, such as RNA-scope or .... 

* GABA~C~ receptors - not blocked, what is the toxin/substance that blocked it? 

* Pharmacological blocking of microglia and astrocyte - better optogenetic/

* Knockdown mice rather than blockers of receptor

* BLA - pyramidal cells were selected based on 

* CXCL12 - fluorocitrate - lack of control group - long incubation of slices in recording chamber.

* To investigate this question we employed the gramicidin perforated patch technique. This method allows for the study of neuronal fi ring while maintaining a relatively intact intracellular milieu, compared to traditional patch techniques that dialyze the intracellular contents ( Akaike and Harata, 1994 ). Gramicidin is a polypeptide antibiotic that forms pores in the neuronal membrane that are selectively permeable to monovalent cations, preserving much of the intracellular signaling machinery ( Akaike, 1996 ). This property is advantageous when studying G protein-coupled receptors that rely on intact intracellular contents for signal transduction.
