## CXCL12 in the basolateral amygdala


<!--introduction regarding chemokine-->
Considering that virtually all types of brain cells express either CXCL12 and/or one of its receptors, this chemokine serves a wide array of functions in both the developing and mature brain.
<!--electrophysiological action-->
Indeed, several lines of evidence illustrate that CXCL12 is involved in neurodevelopment,

Moreover, among  the  constitutively expressed  chemokines,  the  role  of CXCL12 in psychiatric diseases has attracted considerable attention [14–18].<!--trochę zmienić i inne cytowania? -->

In this context, we provide new evidence for the neuromodulatory properties of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in synaptic transmission and membrane properties in the amygdala. 
First, we showed that


Herein, CXCL12 was shown to be a substantial component of ... <!-- substantial component of the descending pain modulatory network and was upregulated in the model of BCP.-->
Firstly,

### BLA

The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is consistent with previous reports demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus [@banisadr_2002a].


### sIPSC mixed effects based on concentration

Although no significant difference were found in the BLA when comparing baseline condition and CXCL12 treatment<!--inaczej napisać-->, bath administration of CXCL12 produced two distinct responses. <!--bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically-->
It is possible that they could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically. <!--znaleźć ten artykuł ... -->

in 2nM - decreased frequency of sIPSC, whereas at 5nM increased frequency of sIPSC.

This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the LHA, where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration ( Guyon et al., 2005a ). 
Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, are reviewed in Guyon and Nahon (2007) .

chemokines usually display a U-shaped dose-dependent  effect  curve,  suggesting  opposing  functions depending on their concentration. 
Such process named ‘hormesis’ relates to adaptative responses to compensate disruption in homeostasis by overshooting homeostatic feedback controls (Mattson 2008). 

This acceleration observed at higher concentrations of CXCL12 a could be mediated by a CXCL12 a metabolite generated in the slice. Indeed, it has been shown that CXCL12 a can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment, namely CXCL12 a (5–67), that exerts its effect through a G-protein coupled receptor distinct from CXCR4 (Zhang et al ., 2003). These effects could overcome the CXCR4 effects. Further experiments using specific MPP inhibitors should clarify this point.[@guyon_2005]

Considering complexity resulting from wide variety of chemokine receptors, 

their complex cellular pattern of expression, different scenario of signaling cascades, ...  differences in postsynaptic cell machinery including different signalling pathways, channels and receptors, and dual/opposite action of the same chemokine, it would not be informative to describe it due to this criteria.

In conclusion, our results show that CX3CL1 may affect glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus by a mechanism involving three different AR subtypes, raising the proposal that opposite regulation might be achieved by chemokine action at single synapses, depending on AR distribution and functional status and, potentially, by the site and mechanism of adenosine release. <!--analogous // Piccinin 2010-->

Further work is required to determine whether these subtypes of BLA principal cells  characterized in this study correspond to some specific subpopulation expressing specific markers, such as <!--jakie są PCs inne markery?--> or have different functional consequences.<!-- coś ala aktywują się na specyficzne bodźce? -->

## CXCL12 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala


However, increased excitability is documented to results either from increasing amplitude of N-type calcium channel or inducing inward rectifier (GIRK) potassium currents, the action mediated by CXC12/CXCR4 axis.<!-- zmienić, citation-->
<!--GIRK or N-type calcium channel in CeA neurons?-->

The activation of the GIRK current could have been mediated directly through CXCR4 activation or through the activation of metabotropic glutamate and ⁄ or GABAB receptors, as SDF-1 a increases glutamate and GABA release in the slice. <!-- GIRK current in the amygdala? GABA B in the amygdala?? -->

Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.

In conclusion, the SDF-1 a -induced hyperpolarization is likely linked to the activation of a GIRK current via stimulation of CXCR4

### Glu mixed effects? 

Guyon_2006
CXCL12 increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12 a . It is therefore likely that CXCL12 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.

### astrocytes 

Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.

Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].

In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018].

For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].
It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis. <!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->


As mentioned previously,  CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
<!--If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->

In rats subjected to restraint stress, acute application of corticotropin releasing factor significantly increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the CeA (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014).

### cross-talk with neuromodulators?

Bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically

### astrocytes

It has been clearly proved that astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) play an essential role in several neuronal functioning aspects, including their excitability and synaptic transmission.<!-- cytowania-->
Astrocytes are identified as sources of immune substances, because large amount of evidences demonstrated that activated astrocytes can release proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα) and chemokines (such as MCP1, CXCL1, and CXCL12) in the CNS to enhance and prolong the pain processing [26,43,44].<!-- zmienić--> 
Shen et al. showed that fluorocitrate, a general glial metabolic inhibitor, exerted an inhibitory effect on the induction of astrocytic marker GFAP and  blockade of CXCL12 induction in bone cancer states [45]. 
Consistent with this study,

For example, astrocyte TNFa has 

Owing to the focus of the existing literature the majority of the central immune signaling and non-neuronal modfications will be focused on microglia and astrocytes, and their related traditional signaling systems, such as cytokines and chemokines. A complicated issue that faces the glial research field is the use of the phrase “ glial activation ” as it has become apparent within the immunology field that immune activation can be both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory in nature. As such we have attempted to provide information as to the direction of this response. Moreover, simple quantification of “ proinflammatory markers of glial activation ” such as microglial CD11b or Iba1 and the astrocyte marker GFAP, does not necessarily ensure a proinflammatory phenotype of these populations at the time of tissue analysis ( Watkins et al., 2007a; Ransohoff & Perry, 2009 ).

Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? -->

Moreover, pretreatment of brain slices with fluorocitrate (100 lM for 30 min) increased sIPSC duration in ventrobasal nucleus neurons or decreased sIPSC duration in the thalamic reticular nucleus neurons (Christian and Huguenard, 2013). - Peng2016 


Since all the experiments presented in the above cited papers were performed using neuronal cultures with a separate astrocytes layer, it cannot be excluded that the neuroprotective effects might be also mediated by glial cells.

Additionally, astrocytes are known to secrete chemokines like CCL5 and CCL3 that may bind CCR5 on neurons and mediate synaptic transmission and plasticity through mechanisms ranging from the prevention of extrasynaptic neurotransmitter diffusion and neurotransmitter clearance to the modulation of synaptic release probability.

### BLA - amygdala - not layered - LTP ?

Finally, in comparison to other reasonably well-understood brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, the amygdaloid nuclei do not show a rigid organization of its neuronal elements. Cells are not organized into layers nor do they have the striking preferred orientation of their major output neurons as described in these other brain regions. Thus it is not surprising that input-output mechanisms in the LA are regulated by the various ionic conductances in the membranes of their major output neurons rather than through mechanisms that rely on architectonics and differences in cell morphology.

### CXCL12 and GABA

CX3CL1 activates GABA synaptic ac-tivity at the postsynaptic level, however, we have reportedstimulatory presynaptic actions of CXCL12 on GABA re-lease (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009). Interestingly, CXCL12also produces a membrane depolarization in 5-HT neu-rons, an effect mediated indirectly by glutamate afferents,whereas CX3CL1 does not exhibit any effect on this pa-rameter. Thus, although the chemokine family is com-prised of a large variety of small chemotactic proteins, itappears that two structurally distinct chemokines, CX3CL1and CXCL12, share common colocalization profiles withthe 5-HT system as well as common functional actions onGABA synaptic activity on 5-HT neurons within the RN.



## Limitations

* GABA~C~ receptors - not blocked, what is the toxin/substance that blocked it? 

* Pharmacological blocking of microglia and astrocyte - better optogenetic/

* Knockdown mice rather than blockers of receptor

* BLA - pyramidal cells were selected based on 

* CXCL12 - fluorocitrate - lack of control group - long incubation of slices in recording chamber.

#### Negative reinforcement

Negative reinforcement models posit that avoidance of unpleasant physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms motivates substance dependence. Our findings are consistent with this model. Increased activity in the amygdala can lead to negative emotion and autonomic dysregulation—both of which are associated with opioid and alcohol withdrawal and may drive drug-seeking (Tovote et al., 2015).

#### Sickness behavior, peripheral immune activation

Earlier studies in rats have shown that peripheral immune activation using LPS or streptococcal enterotoxin B alters EEG-like activity in central amygdala 125–200 min post-treatment ( Engler et al., 2011; Prager et al., 2013 ) and caudal amygdala at 110 min post-treatment ( Doenlen et al., 2011 ). [@munshi_2018]. We found that peripheral inflammagens rapidly increase the firing of BLA neurons, thereby providing a clue as to how it might trigger changes in behavior.

#### CXCL12 

Multiple mechanisms may terminate CXCR4 signaling: desensitization, internalization, and degradation, each of which act to guard against inappropriately sustained signaling.Desensitization of CXCR4 and other GPCRs can be either acute or sustained: short-term desensitization spans minutes and results from β-arrestin-mediated steric hinderance of G-protein engagement. Longer term desensitization occurs over hours to days and results from persistent internalization, degradation, and transcriptional downregulation. Following ligand binding, CXCR4 phosphorylation, and G protein recruitment, β-arrestin is recruited to sterically hinder G-protein engagement with the receptor (desensitization).
<!-- raczej nieważne -->
Control over receptor internalization is exerted at the level of ligand binding. Recent studies demonstrate that inverse agonists (TAK779) of CXCR4 stimulate a higher rate of receptor internalization compared to partial agonists (Met-CCL5), suggesting an actively driven internalization process.39 Following internalization, CXCR4 signaling can continue. For example, CXCL12 mediates human neural progenitor cell survival by binding CXCR4 localized to the endosome.40 CXCR4 also localizes to the endosome for degradation which is controlled at several levels
Cytoskeletal activity can link CXCR4 internalization to endosomal degradation. Rho and Gα13 mediate the actin polymerization necessary for trafficking CXCR4 into the endosomal compartment.41 Furthermore, adaptor proteins are necessary for endocytosis: a complex interplay between CXCR4, β-arrestin, and adaptor protein, AP2, is necessary to mediate CXCR4 endocytosis—mechanistic insight is lacking.42 Adaptor proteins are also necessary for CXCR4 recycling, for example, IQGAP1 regulates endosome interactions with microtubules during CXCR4 trafficking back to the cell membrane.43 
Whether a receptor is recycled or degraded is largely a function of the overall number of receptors internalized,42 competing cargo for CXCR4-binding motifs42 and the cytoskeleton.43 A network of CXCR4-binding proteins and cytoskeletal processes control CXCR4 signal termination—finer mechanistic insight will provide potential for therapeutic modulation.

In cerebellum, the activation of this signalling pathway by neurotransmitters is known to play a crucial role both in synaptic activity and plasticity processes Linden, 1994; . Chen and Tonegawa, 1997 . <!-- ANALOGICAL - in amygdala, this pathways .... -->


<!-- Complicating these levels of regulation is the fact that overall protein synthesis rates are high in the young brain, decline through adulthood, and fall sharply with old age [13], [56]. Protein turnover in the brain appears to follow a similar pattern [13]; however, little is known about the effects of age on other protein modifications. In addition, proteins such as GFAP show increased metabolic turnover with age, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. Our results are consistent with independent regulation of chemokine expression at the mRNA and post-translational levels.-->

### summary

By employing transgenic mice with chronically elevated expression of CCL2 specifically in astrocytes, it was showed that CCL2 reduced synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, whereas it enhanced short-term synaptic plasticity [@nelson_2011].
However, although both acute and chronic CCL2 leads to presynaptic alternations in glutamatergic input to the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the molecular mechanism underlying this discrepancy remains unclear. 
As those experiments varied regarding: (i) CCL2 application (acute vs. chronic), (ii) source (astrocytic vs. bath-applied during recordings), (iii) method (patch-clamp vs. extracellular recordings), more studies clarifying this issue are needed. <!-- analogous to cxc12 as a summary of astrocytic cxcr4? -->

### Oligodendrocytes 
The importance of oligodendrocytes in the regulation of synaptic transmission is just now being appreciated, and only scarce evidence has been reported so far. 
However, few studies suggested two molecular targets, which may be involved in this phenomenon: BDNF and glutamine synthetase (GS).
Recently, it was shown that oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF might function *via* presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to ensure fast, reliable neurotransmitter release in the developing brain [@jang_2019].
Moreover, this mechanism was recently described to play a role in cognitive impairment [@geraghty_2019].<!-- chyba BDNF derived from microglia 
Another promising molecule is GS.
The study illustrated that depletion of OL GS disrupts neuronal glutamate signaling with accompanying changes in behavioral function [@xin_2019].
Interestingly, OLs survival and myelination were unaffected, thus demonstrating a myelin-independent role for oligodendrocytes in supporting glutamate signaling in the brain [@xin_2019]. -->


<!-- The CeA receives processed nociceptive input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and direct nociceptive input via the spino-parabrachial-amygdaloid pathway (Missig et al., 2017; Bernard et al., 1989; Braz et al., 2005;McDonald et al., 1999), and consists of mainly inhibitory GABAergic neurons categorized as projection neurons and interneurons. The CeA interneurons are the interface between the neuronal input and output of the nucleus (Sun et al.,1994). Enkephalin (Enk) and dynorphin are endogenous opioid neu-ropeptides with wide distribution through the CNS including CeA (Poulin et al., 2008; Marchant et al., 2007).κ-,δ- andμ-opioid receptorsare found in the CeA (Mansour et al., 1994), supporting functionalimportance of opioid neuropeptides in the CeA (Poulin et al., 2008; Marchant et al., 2007). Dynorphin is expressed mainly in the medialsubdivision of the CeA by a group of projection neurons, which also express CRF (Marchant et al., 2007) while Enk is synthesized andlimited to a subset of interneurons in the centrolateral and centrocentral part of the CeA (Poulin et al., 2008). A high number of Enkneurons are found to overlap with CeA neurons that express PKC-δ (Haubensak et al., 2010). The PKC-δ cells, also called“OFF cells”, are considered to be the master switch of amygdala output (Haubensaket al., 2010; Amano et al., 2012). Thus, many Enk interneurons likelyengage in feed-forward inhibition of CeA interneurons and projection neurons (Bajo et al., 2011) and are a key element for regulation of CeAoutput and pain sensitivity.

The CeA is a complex brain region that regulates a wide variety ofautonomic and non-autonomic functions, including modulation of ongoing pain. The CeA mediates both pro- and anti-analgesic effects through the activation of different cell groups, receptors and neuro-transmitters (Andreoli et al., 2017;Missig et al., 2017;Cai et al., 2018; Werka, 1994).

The CeA is a source of robust amygdala outputs to regions thatmodulate both anxiety and pain sensitivity. Two primary outputs include CeA projections to the vlPAG, which regulate pain via the descending pain inhibitory system (Oliveira and Prado, 2001), and pro-jections to the adjacent DR, which control defensive and anxiety responses to a variety of aversive stimuli (Biagioni et al., 2013;Teissier et al., 2015). This would suggest that activation of CeA inhibitoryprojections would suppress vlPAG and support hyperalgesia, and that any CeA element that regulates CeA inhibitory projections would remove this suppression and permit regulation of pain. However, this is complicated by thefinding that major targets of CeA inhibitory

In addition, CeA projections are not only GA-BAergic, but contain various neuropeptides such as CRF, dynorphin and neurokinin B as co-transmitters (Marchant et al., 2007). It is not sur-prising, then, that the role of CeA in pain perception depends on the circumstances, producing either analgesia or algesia (Carrasquillo andGereau, 2008;Andreoli et al., 2017; Veinante et al., 2013).-->
