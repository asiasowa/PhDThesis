# Conclusions

In the present work we characterized the role of different ARs in the CX3CL1-induced modulation of hi ppocampal glutamatergic transmission using cultured neurons and brain slices. The main fi nding of this study is that CX3CL1 action requires the activation of A1A, A2AR and A3R, by locally released or tonic adenosine. Speci fi cally, CX3CL1 causes glutamatergic depression through A1R and A3R and potentiation through A2AR stimulation. Thus, CX3CL1 might affect glutamatergic synapses in opposite way, depending on the prevailing functional expression of AR subtypes. 

The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission. 
Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release [@limatola_2000, @ragozzino_2002], modulate the functional properties of ionic channels [@lax_2002, @oh_2002] and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes [@lax_2002]. 
In addition, the chemokine system can alter the actions of neuronally active pharmacological agents such as opioids and the cannabinoid system [@heinisch_2011]. 
Moreover, chemokine receptor knockout mice (CCR6, CCR7, CXCR5) have recently been shown to exhibit behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes of relevance to psychiatric disorders, which suggests their essential role in physiological conditions [@harrison_2014, @jaehne_2014, @stuart_2014].

Nevertheless, our data support the notion that an adequate cross-talk between microglia and neurons is required for the correct functional maturation of newborn granule neurons and for the proper regulation of emotional behavior. These data contribute to increasing our understanding of AHN under both physiological and pathological conditions. - Bolos2018

In summary, our data demonstrate that baseline inhibitory synaptic transmission in SG neurons is markedly enhanced by minocycline. This may function to decrease the excitability of SG neurons, thus leading to a modulation of nociceptive transmission.- Peng2016

 Our data lay the fundamental groundwork to investigate microglia-astrocyte cross talk and juxtavascular microglial function in the healthy and diseased brain.
 
 In vitro and in vivo studies have reported that both of these chemokines modulate dopamine neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway, modifying the electrophysiological state of the neurons and dopamine release via the corresponding endogenous receptors
 
 
 
Another important aspect of neuropeptide signalling in the central amygdala that we illustrated is that neuropeptides can antagonise each other’s action (CRF vs nociception and NPY;vasopressin vs oxytocin), or at least have opposing effects (PACAP and CGRP vs galanin), work synergistically (oxytocin and angiotensin IV), or have at least similar effects  (PACAP and CGRP, CRF and angiotensin-II). This makes neuropeptide signalling in the central amygdala highly dynamic, which is further amplified by their ability to interfere with synaptic plasticity as seen for CGRP in threat learning (Han et al.2010). Taken together, the rich diversity of neuro-peptides and their receptors in the central amygdala, second only to the hypothalamus, makes it possible to fine-tune amygdala activity and resulting output to maintain emotional homeostasis.  <!-- zerżnięte z van der bourg review o peptides in CeA - analogicznie dla chemokin -->

The identification of AR1as downstream element responsible for beneficial effects of CX3CL1 on neuron survival against Glu neurotoxicity may represent an important challenge for management of neurological disorders including acute brain ischemia.

However, considering that dendritic spines reflect the structural level of synaptic plasticity along with extensive evidence of chemokine actions on excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, it is tempting to speculate that chemokines actions on dendritic spines are still unexplored. 

Thus, further experiments identifying the properties and functions of each of neuronal, microglial, astrocytic and, oligodendrocytic compartments remain to be addressed. 

In summary, our data identify an innate neuronal TLR4 signal that functions in the CeA and VTA to regulate the initiation of excessive alcohol drinking through MCP-1 neurotransmission likely at the level of dopamine (Banisadr et al , 2005; Guyon et al , 2009; Apartis et al , 2010). However, the MCP-1 neurotransmission mechanism, the role of TLR4-regulated   cytokines/chemokines   with   neuron– neuron, and bidirectional neuron–microglia communications (namely, fractalkine (Laing et  al , 2010)) in the transition to alcohol dependence, their relationship to alcohol-induced CRF expression, and the role of the brain site are still unclear. Ongoing studies are designed to address these questions.

We confirmed that TLR4 and MCP-1 are expressed in glial cells (SD, Supplementary Figure S3), and posit that transition involves  bidirectional  neuron-glia  cross-talk  through released soluble factors and glial cell cytokine production (Frank et al , 2010; Hines et al , 2013)

The microglia-dependent CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling cascade played a role in microglial-neuron interactions and in descending facilitation of BCP.<!-- analogous-->

Modulation of GABA synaptic activity at 5-HT neuronsby CX3CL1, and by additional members of the chemokine family, such as CXCL12, may be clinically significant in thepathophysiology and treatment of 5-HT related mood disorders, including depression experienced by immunocom-promised individuals. CX3CL1 and other chemokines mayalso represent a new class of CNS neuromodulators, im-pacting brain function via their effects on traditional neuro-transmitter and neuropeptide systems, including the 5-HTsystem (Adler and Rogers, 2005; Adler et al., 2006; Calle-waere et al., 2007; Rostene et al., 2007). Thus, our studyprovides additional support for the general hypothesis thatchemokines, in addition to traditional neurotransmittersand neuropeptides, represent a novel neuromodulatorysystem in the CNS. 

## Limitations

* due to technical/methodological implication of difficulties regarding immunofluorescent stainings of receptors and imperfections of many antibodies, the results concerning co-localization needs to be verified by using more sensitive methods, such as RNA-scope or .... 

* GABA~C~ receptors - not blocked, what is the toxin/substance that blocked it? 

* Pharmacological blocking of microglia and astrocyte - better optogenetic/

* Knockdown mice rather than blockers of receptor

* BLA - pyramidal cells were selected based on 

* CXCL12 - fluorocitrate - lack of control group - long incubation of slices in recording chamber.

### CXCL12 and CX3CL1 - SUMMARY

CX3CL1 activates GABA synaptic activity at the postsynaptic level, however, we have reported stimulatory presynaptic actions of CXCL12 on GABA release (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009). Interestingly, CXCL12 also produces a membrane depolarization in 5-HT neurons, an effect mediated indirectly by glutamate afferents, whereas CX3CL1 does not exhibit any effect on this parameter.
Thus, although the chemokine family is comprised of a large variety of small chemotactic proteins, it appears that two structurally distinct chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, share common colocalization profiles with the 5-HT system as well as common functional actions on GABA synaptic activity on 5-HT neurons within the RN.
