Nevertheless, our data support the notion that an adequate
cross-talk between microglia and neurons is required for the cor- rect functional maturation of newborn granule neurons and for the proper regulation of emotional behavior. These data contribute to increasing our understanding of AHN under both physiological and pathological conditions. - Bolos2018

In summary, our data demonstrate that baseline inhibitory synaptic transmission in SG neurons is markedly enhanced by minocycline. This may function to decrease the excitability of SG neurons, thus leading to a modulation of nociceptive transmission.- Peng2016

 Our data lay the fundamental groundwork to investigate microglia-astrocyte cross talk and juxtavascular microglial function in the healthy and diseased brain.
