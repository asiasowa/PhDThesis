# Introduction

## Chemokines

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins. So far, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized <http:// cytokine.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/>. They can be classified into CXC, CC, C or CX3C subfamilies based on the arrangement of the two cysteine residues near the N-terminus [@Zlotnik2000] \ref{family}. 

![ *Chemokine families.* Chemokines are classified in four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus.

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface receptors that belong to the superfamily of seven-membrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are expressed in a wide variety of cells [@Bacon2000a]. Studies indicate that chemokines and their receptors interact with each other in a complex manner. There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction [@Howard1996]. Moreover, after interaction with chemokines, some receptors undergo dimerization (heterodimerization, homodimerization) and oligomerization process, which seems to be critical for the triggering of biological responses [@Mellado2001].  
Chemokines were originally identified as serving chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins. Of particular interest is the idea that central nervous system (CNS) chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation, but also function as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in the brain [@Adler2005]. Like those systems, the chemokine system is widely but unevenly distributed in the brain and has both ligands and receptors expressed in neurons. Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? The plausible explanation is that they may provide a bridge between the immune and nervous systems, which are classically viewed as two complex and distinct entities. 
The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission. Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release [@Limatola2000, @Ragozzino2002], modulate the functional properties of ionic channels [@Lax2002, @Oh2002] and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes [@Lax2002]. In addition, the chemokine system can alter the actions of neuronally active pharmacological agents such as opioids and the cannabinoid system [@Heinisch2011]. Moreover, chemokine receptor knockout mice (CCR6, CCR7, CXCR5) have recently been shown to exhibit behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes of relevance to psychiatric disorders, which suggests their essential role in physiological conditions [@Harrison2014, @Jaehne2014, @Stuart2014].


In this thesis, only CXCL12 and CX3CL1 have been investigated, as they are only two chemokines expressed under physiological conditions. For example, the chemokines SDF-1α/CXCL12 and fractalkine/CX3CL1 as well as their receptors CXCR4, CXCR7 and CX3CR1 are expressed constitutively, even in physiological conditions, throughout the CNS [@Banisadr2002a, @Hesselgesser1999, @Schonemeier2008].

### CX3CL1

Fractalkine, also known as CX3CL1, is a unique chemokine belonging to CX3C chemokine family that is present both as soluble and membrane-anchored form [@Bajetto2001]. Fractalkine is the endogenous ligand for CX3CR1, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which specifically interacts with both forms of CX3CL1 [@Imai1997]. Recent reports confine the localization of CX3CL1 to neurons and astrocytes and CX3CR1 to neurons and microglia in many brain regions including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum and thalamus [@Tarozzo2003]. In physiological conditions, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling is involved in different neural functions both in development (participation in functional maturation of neuronal circuits driving cell positioning) and adulthood (regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions) [@Lauro2015]. Furthermore, fractalkine seems to play an essential role in a unique neuronal-glial interaction between neurons and CX3CR1-expressing microglia under normal and pathological states [@Cardona2006, @Jurgens2012]. In fact, CX3CL1 is a confirmed inhibitor of basal glutamate synaptic activity in the hippocampus [@Bertollini2006]. The ability of CX3CL1 to modulate glutamate function is thought to be responsible for some of its neuroprotective actions, and provides further support for the chemokine-neuromodulatory role in the CNS [@Adler2005, @Callewaere2007, @Guyon2007].

### CXCL12

SDF-1α (CXCL12) is another chemokine which has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive distribution in the CNS as well as the fact that it can be produced not only by glial cells but also by neurons [@Banisadr2003, @Heinisch2010a, @Stumm2002]. This chemokine has been shown to play an essential role in brain plasticity during development but also in regulating the activity of various brain circuits in normal and pathological conditions [@Merino2014, @Timotijević2012, @Tiveron2008]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that there are several cross-talks between the CXCL12 and with its receptor CXCR4 and other neurotransmitter systems in the brain (e.g. GABA, glutamate and endocannabinoids) [@Heinisch2010a, @Heinisch2011]. The neuromodulatory actions of CXCL12 have been observed in various neuronal populations, including the hippocampus [@Kasiyanov2008], cerebellum [@Limatola2000], MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area [@Guyon2005] (LHA), vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamus [@Callewaere2006], dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra [@Guyon2006], the dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2010a] and recently the amygdala [@Yang2016]. What is particularly interesting, CXCL12 has often similar effects in these various circuits (increase in glutamate and/or GABA synaptic activity), however these effects occur via different mechanisms, even within one structure. For example, in the dorsal raphe nucleus CXCL12 increases the frequency of recorded spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSC) in serotonergic neurons through a pre-synaptic mechanism, but decreases sIPSC amplitude via a post-synaptic mechanism in non-serotonergic neurons [@Heinisch2010a]. Moreover, CXCL12 often appears to exert opposite effects on neuronal function depending on its concentration, e.g. in MCH-expressing neurons of the LHA, where the action potential discharge is different depending on the concentration [@Guyon2005]. Of particular interest is the observation that pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation leads to elevated levels of CXCL12 and other chemokines by activation of glial or endothelial cells which in turn release chemokines [@Guyon2014]. The chemokines released bind to CXCR4 present on neurons and induce changes in excitability that could induce an adaptive response to inflammation, leading to “sickness behavior,” characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue [@Dantzer2001, @Dantzer2007]. Sickness behavior is considered to be the physiological and psychological effect of immune activation during the course of infection, which is primarily mediated by the central action of peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines. Given the abundance of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS, it is not surprising that changes of cytokine/chemokine levels during inflammation are causing multiple physiological and behavioral perturbations. For example, effects of CXCL12 on dorsal raphe neurons could underlie depressive symptoms frequently observed with inflammation [@Maes1998], as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression. Similarly, the effects of CXCL12 on MCH neurons which are part of the feeding behavior and metabolism control circuit [@Nahon2006] could explain anorexia. These symptoms of sickness behavior are usually reversible when inflammation stops. Overall, this chemokine system is one of the key players in the neuro-immune interface that participates in shaping CNS responses to changes in the environment.

## Amygdala

The amygdala, a limbic region in the medial temporal lobe. Amygdala activity is critical for mood regulation and the central and peripheral stress response as well as attaching emotional valence to perceived stimuli [@Duvarci2014, @Hermans2014]. 
The various nuclei of the amygdaloid complex can be grouped in to three major functionally different domains by their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and intercalated cell masses (ICM). The amygdala is very densely interconnected.
 

### Basolateral amygdala
The BLA is considered to be the main point of entry for cortical and subcortical sensory inputs into the amygdala [@Duvarci2014].  Within the BLA, which developmentally and structurally is a cortical-like structure, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons [@Spampanato2011]. The pyramidal-like cells follow the electrophysiological profile of their cortical counterparts, having either a regular spiking or intrinsically bursting phenotype, with pronounced spike frequency adaptation [@Sah2003]. There are at least five distinct types of interneurons, which differ in their neurochemistry and electrophysiological properties and morphology, however most of them are of the fast-spiking variety, with no apparent adaptation [@Spampanato2011]. In the BLA, principal cells form local synapses with inhibitory interneurons. However, they also have numerous longer distance collaterals synapsing onto other principal cells [@Duvarci2014]. Principal cells in the BLA send their axons to the CeA, either directly or via intercalated GABAergic cell clusters in the intermediate capsule [@Jungling2008].  


### Central amygdala
Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered as a main output nuclei. Most ot the CeA neurons are GABAergic in nature, morphologically reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons. Three electrophysiological subtypes of CeA neurons have been described: regular spiking, low threshold bursting and late firing [@DeArmentiaMikelLopezSah2004]. The CeA network then receives signals from the BLA and computes the inhibitory GABAergic output to various brain areas.

### Amygdala and neuroinflammation
Amygdala is considered to be an essential component of the brain circuitry that forms the neural response to systemic immune activation [@Gaykema2007] and it is involved in sickness behavior [@Dantzer2008, @Goehler2007, @Roozendaal2009].
Regarding neuroinflammation circuit, pro-inflammatory cytokines signal the brain mainly through the activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to amygdala [@Goehler2000, @Quan2008]. Therefore, it is important to get better insights into brain activity during acute and chronic immune responses.
Evidence from many animal studies indicates that LPS significantly increases c-fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and, to a lesser extent, in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) [@Engler2011, @Frenois2007, @Vitkovic2000]. Moreover, functional and neuroanatomical studies indicate that peripheral immune activation may also affect amygdala function in humans. For example, depressive-like symptoms and anxiety can be transiently elicited in healthy human subjects by peripheral administration of LPS [@Grigoleit2011, @Harrison2009, @Wright2005]. These findings suggest that in humans, similar to rodents, the amygdala is involved in the integration of behavioral and immune responses.
A recent study documented that LPS-induced anxiety in mice as well as a pronounced increase in sEPSC frequency resulting in the hyperexcitability of BLA neurons were mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction [@Yang2016]. This suggests that alterations of CXCL12 signaling in this area play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation, and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety, a key component of a sickness behavior. Several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA [@Nishiyori1998, @Tarrozo2003], suggesting a possible influence on amygdala function. Although CX3CL1 also modulate synaptic activity and has been shown to modulate glutamate and GABA release in the hippocampus [@Ragozzino2006] and dorsal raphe nucleus [@Heinisch2009a], its neuromodulatory role in other brain centers remains unknown. Surprisingly, so far there have been no neurophysiological studies of CX3CL1 effects in the amygdala.
