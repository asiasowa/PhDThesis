<p>Adult and PW male Sprague Dawley rats were anaesthetized (with 40% urethane, 5% chloral hydrate in saline; 0.5 ml/100 g, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, USA) with body temperature maintained at 37 ± 0.5C. Small holes were drilled into the skull to allow the insertion of electrodes into the brain. A bipolar 125mm stimulating electrode was inserted into the mPFC (adults: anteroposterior, 3.0 e 3.3 mm anterior to bregma; 0.7 e 1.0 mm lateral; 3.8 e 4.8 mm below the pial surface; PW: anteroposterior, 2.7 e 2.9 mm anterior to bregma; 0.5 e 0.6 mm lateral; 3.4 e 3.8 mm below the pial surface; Fig. 1 ). A single recording microelectrode (glass; tip diameter, 2 e 5mm; fi lled with 2 M NaCl; resistance,1 e 4U) was slowly lowered into the BLA (adults: anteroposterior, 3 mm posterior to bregma; lateral, 5 mm; ventral,  7.6 mm; post-weanlings: anteroposterior, 2.6 mm posterior to bregma; lateral, 4.8 e 4.9 mm; ventral,  7.4 mm; Fig.1 ). The evoked responses were digitized (10 kHz) and analyzed using a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401-plus data acquisition system (Cambridge, UK) and its Spike2 software. Of fl ine measurements were made of the amplitude of fi eld post-synaptic potentials (fPSPs) using averages of fi ve successive responses to a given stimulation intensity applied at 0.1 Hz. Test stimuli (monopolar pulses; 100ms duration) were delivered at 0.1 Hz. After positioning the electrodes, the rats were left for 30 min before commencing the experiment. 2.3. LTP induction LTP was induced using the Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) protocol, which was applied in all groups within 1.5 h of anesthesia. Theta-like high-frequency stimulation was delivered at 100 Hz (TS100) to the mPFC in three sets of 10 trains, each consisting of 10 pulses (inter-train interval, 200 ms; inter-set interval, 1 min). In all experiments baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of suf fi cient intensity (300 e 800mA) to elicit a response representing 40 e 50% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked fi eld potentials. TBS was delivered at the same intensity and pulse duration as the test stimuli during establishment of the baseline responses. Evoked field potentials at the baseline intensity were recorded from the BLA for up to 60 min following the application of TBS. The results are presented as the mean of each 5 min period to give 12 time points. LTP was de fined as an increase in the amplitude of the fPSPs. Changes in fPSP amplitude were measured for each rat as a percentage of change from its baseline.</p>
<p>During experiments, individual slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber and were continuously superfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 2 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2. The recording temperature was 25 ± 3 °C. Neurons were visualized under the guidance of infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and by their green fluorescence with epifluorescence illumination.</p>
<p>Measurement of synaptic responses and LTP induction. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs), in the presence of GABA receptor type A (GABAAR) antagonist gabazine (1 μM), were recorded from identified neurons in current or voltage clamp. Basal synaptic responses were evoked by a brief pulse (0.1–0.5 ms) of either constant voltage or current delivered by a stimulus isolation unit (Isoflex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) every 20 s with tungsten bipolar electrodes. Stimulation electrodes were positioned at axonal bundles of inputs of interest. Synaptic strength was quantified as the peak amplitude of EPSP or EPSC. Baseline responses were collected with a stimulation intensity that yielded 10–30% of the maximal response. Slices displaying unstable baseline recording or series resistance change of &gt;20% were discarded. For the cortex→BLA-PN synapse, LTP was induced by pairing four trains of HFS (HFS × 4, 100 Hz for 1 s per train; 10 s intervals) with brief supra-threshold current step injections (approximately 2 nA; 1 ms) into the postsynaptic cell (with a 5 ms delay) in a current clamp. For the BLA→CeM neuron synapse, LTP was induced by HFS × 4 (10 s intervals), with postsynaptic cells held at –70 mV in a current clamp54. Similarly, HFS × 4 (20 s intervals), with postsynaptic cells held at –50 mV, was used to induce LTP at the lPB→CeL neuron synapse40. <span class="citation">(<strong>chiang_2015?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>Field potential recordings Slices were transferred to an interface chamber that was continually perfused with ACSF at a rate of 1 to 2 ml/min. Microelectrodes were pulled from microfiber-filled borosilicate capillaries (OD 1.0 mm, ID 0.78 mm) using a FlamingBrown horizontal micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Extracellular recording electrodes (2–5MΩ) were filled with 3 M NaCl. The microelectrode tips were visually positioned in the basolateral region of the amygdala (between the EC and the bed nucleus of the stria terminals) under a dissecting microscope. Field potentials were amplified with a differential amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.). Output was digitized with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). On- and off-line data acquisition and analysis were carried out using WCP version 1.7b (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes were normalized to averaged baseline value (100%). The maximum rate of fEPSP within 10–90% declining phase was measuredas the slope of fEPSP using the WCP software. The recordings were made at room temperature. That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. Stimulation Synaptic responses were evokedwith sharpened tungsten bipolarstimulating electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,FL) placed in the external capsule (EC). The stimulating electrode was ~2 mm from the recording site. Stimuli were delivered using a photoelectric stimulus isolation unit with a constant cur-rent output (ISO-Flex; Stimulus Isolation Unit, Jerusalem, Israel). The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a synaptic response of less than 50% of the maximum amplitude. Single 0.1-msec monophasic square pulses were applied continuously throughout the experiment at 0.1 Hz. To induce synaptic plasticity, theta burst stimulation (TBS), trains of five pulses at 100 Hz were given at 5 Hz (the theta rhythm) for 4 s, at the same intensity through the same electrode used for test stimulation. TBS mimics the typical firing mode of hippocampal pyramidal cells during learning (Otto et al.1991). <span class="citation">(<strong>chen_2017?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>Glass microelectrodes(Science Products) werefilled with ACSF (tip resistance 3 MΩ) and placed in the LA to recordfield potentials. Bipolar stimulationelectrodes were used to stimulatefibers within the LA (IN) or in theexternal capsule (EC). An input/output response curve was constructed by varying the intensity of the single-pulse stimulation and averaging six responses per intensity. The stimulus intensity that evoked afield potential with amplitude equal to 50% of themaximal response was then used for all subsequent stimulations. Once a stable baseline of responses had been obtained for at least 20 min, either HFS (two trains at 100 Hz, 1 sec duration, 30 sec apart) was delivered as to induce LTP or low frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz, 15 min) was applied to induce LTD (Müller et al. 2009). Subsequent responses to single stimuli were recorded for at least 60 min, and their amplitude quantified as a percent change with re-spect to baseline. The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP. Drug applicationAll drugs were bath-applied at the indicated concentrations starting at least 30 min before HFS or LFS. Capsaicin and AMG 9810 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience. Data analysis Extracellular data were collected and averaged using the custommade software Signal 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). We defined thefield potential amplitude as the absolute DC voltage of a verti-cal line running from the minimal point of thefield potential to itsintersection with a line running tangential to thefield potentialonset and offset points. The significance of differences betweengroups (n= number of slices) was calculated with a two-wayANOVA (GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad software). Significance was set atP&lt; 0.05. To express and compare changes in the ampli-tudes of thefield potentials between the animal groups, we aver-aged responses from the period of 59 to 60 min after HFS or LFS.</p>
<p>They were then submerged in a chamber (1.0 ml, 2.5 ml/min) at 30  1°C for another hour before recording. BLA fibers were stimulated with concentric electrodes (50 k  ) using 150-s pulses of varying intensity (3–15 V) at 0.05 Hz, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the capsula/medial CeA with tungsten electrodes (2–5 M  ). fEPSP magnitude was adjusted to 30% of maximum response and baseline recorded, and LTP was induced using high-frequency stimulation (HFS) consisting of five trains of stimuli (100 Hz for 1 s, 3-min intervals). fEPSPs were recorded at 0.05 Hz for another hour, and their slopes were normalized to baseline values. A one- or twotailed unpaired t -test or one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests were used for statistical analysis; n equals the number of slices. Methodologies for patch recording (Liu et al. 2004) and Western blot analysis (Zinebi et al. 2003) were similar to that reported previousl</p>
<p>One slice per animal was investigated. Recordings began approx. 2.5 h after slice preparation and LTP/LTD induction was attempted approx. 1 h later. Field potentials (FPs) were evoked using the concentric platinum/stainless steel electrode (FHC, USA) by the stimulation (frequency: 0.05 Hz, duration: 100 u s) of external or internal capsule to stimulate cortico-amygdalar or thalamo-amygdalar connections, respectively (reviewed in [24] ). FPs were recorded using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–3 M ́) placed in the LA. Signals were amplified (Axoprobe 2, Axon Instruments, USA), band-pass fil-tered (1 Hz–5 kHz), A/D converted (micro1401 interface, CED, UK) and analyzed on- and off-line (Signal 2 software, CED, UK). Since the initial slope measure of the FP in the LA is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal [23] , we analyzed the amplitude of FPs. After initial stabilization of the responses, input–output curves were constructed and then the stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke FPs of 50% of the maximum amplitude. After 15 min of baseline recording, LTP was induced by the theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol consisting of three trains of stimuli delivered every 5 min. Each train was composed of six sequences of pulses delivered at frequency of 5 Hz [29] . Each sequence consisted of eight pulses delivered at 100 Hz. TBS stimulation pattern was used since LA projection neurons have an intrinsic propensity to generate voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations in the theta frequency range [15] and stimulation of the LA at theta frequency induces local activity that resembles that occurring during fear [30] . In a separate set of experiments, after 15 min of baseline recording, LTD was induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses at 1 Hz) [26] . Both TBS and LFS were repeated every 45 min in order to reach the saturation level of LTP and LTD, respectively [28] . LTP/LTD was considered saturated if the difference between the amplitudes of FPs after consecutive TBS/LFS delivery was not significant. To examine short-term plasticity, paired-pulse stimulation protocols were used. The stimulation intensity was set so that the first stimulus of a pair evoked a response that was 50% of the maximum. Paired stimuli were delivered every 20 s to both inputs to the LA in an interleaved fashion. Inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 25, 50, 100, 200, 600 and 1000 ms were tested in an ascending order and at each interval four successive FPs were recorded. <span class="citation">(<strong>danielewicz_2014?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>Slices containing the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) were transferred to an interface-type recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a modified ACSF (33.5 ± 0.2◦C) in which the concentration of MgSO4was lowered to 1 mM. 2.3. Field potential recording Recordings began approx. 2.5 h after slice preparation. Field potentials (FPs) were evoked by stimulating (0.05 Hz, pulse duration: 100 u s) the external or internal capsule to activate cortico-amygdalar or thalamo-amygdalar connections respectively [20] . FPs were recorded using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (1–3 M OhM ). Signals were amplified (Axoprobe 2, Axon Instruments, USA), band-pass filtered (1 Hz–5 kHz) and A/D converted (micro1401 interface, Signal 2 software, CED, UK). After measurement of the relationship between the stimulus intensity and amplitude of the early, negative-going wave of FPs (input-output curve) stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke FPs of 50% of maximum response. Next, after 15 min of baseline recording LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) composed of six trains of pulses delivered at 5 Hz. Each train consisted of eight pulses delivered at 100 Hz. TBS was repeated three times every 5 min. To reach the saturation level of LTP, TBS sequences were repeated 4 and 5 times at the thalamic and the cortical input to the LA, respectively, every 45 minutes [17] . LTD was induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses at 1 Hz). In both inputs LFS sequences were delivered 5 times to saturate LTD.</p>
<p>Data analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the SigmaPlot 11.0 software (Systat Software, Inc.). The mean amplitude of responses recorded after the last conditioning stimulation was compared to the initial baseline values and expressed as a percentage of change. Group comparisons employed two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the type of treatment (MS or control) as the first factor and the drug administered (imipramine or saline) as the second factor. Two-way ANOVA was followed by the Tukey’s posthoc test and p &lt; 0.05 was taken as significant. Data are presented as group means ± SEM. Stimulus-response plots were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: Vi= Vmax/(1 + exp ((u-uh)/-S)). The following parameters were compared: the maximum field potential amplitude (Vmax), the stimulation intensity evoking a field potential of half-maximum amplitude (uh) and the factor proportional to the slope of the curve (S). <span class="citation">(<strong>danielewicz_2017?</strong>)</span></p>
