<p>Details regarding the primary and secondary antibodies used in our immunohistochemistry experiments are provided in Table ….</p>
<!-- table caption The table provides information about the primary antibodies used in our immunolabeling studies including the primary antibody species, clonality, dilution, and catalog number. The secondary antibody used to detect the primary antibody is listed and specifics regarding the secondary antibody species and dilution are provided.

<p>A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to
19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002).</p>
<p>To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat
antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002).</p>
<p>The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007).</p>
<p>A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat
CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - CHEMOKINE INTERACTIONS WITH THE SEROTONIN AND OPIOID SYSTEMS: ANATOMICAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE RAT BRAIN - PHD thesis</p>
<p>The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we
used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).</p>
<p>Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with omission of primary antibodies and no specific staining was detected (data not shown).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Immmunohistochemistry</h3>
<p>To analyze co-localization of chemokines (SDF-1α or fractalkine) or chemokine
receptors (CXCR4 or CX3CR1) with serotonergic neurons, midbrain slices were initially incubated with either goat anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-CXCR4 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-fractalkine antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs, East Orange, NJ) overnight at 4oC. Sections were incubated in mouse anti-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) antibody (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4oC. Subsequently, immunohistochemical labeling was detected with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and an Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.</p>
<p>CX3CR1 localization to neurons and glia was determined by a sequential
incubation of brain slices with a rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs), mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and mouse anti- CD11b FITC-conjugated antibody (1:100; Chemicon). Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4oC, and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse anti-CD11b FITC-conjugated antibody. Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) and AMCA-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.</p>

examined by incubating brain slices with antibodies directed towards either SDF-1α and CXCR4 or fractalkine and CX3CR1. We employed the rabbit anti-SDF-1α antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs) to avoid species cross-reactivity during the combined application of SDF-1α and CXCR4 antibodies. Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4oC. Next, brain sections were placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and fractalkine, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect SDF-1α and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.</p>
<p>For all immunohistochemical experiments, brain sections were rinsed with PB
solution (3 x 10 min) between incubations. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and cover slipped with Prolong Gold Antifade</p>

<p>The total number of cells, Iba1+ microglia, <!--Parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons and DCX+ neuroblasts--> were calculated under a <!--LSM710 Zeiss confocal--> microscope <!--(63x Oil immersion objective for all the cell counts except for PV+ interneurons, which were analyzed under a 25X Oil immersion objective)--> using the apotome<!--physical dissector method adapted for confocal microscopy (Llorens-Martin et al., 2013).-->
<!--Briefly, six stacks of images per animal were used to determine the density of mature granule neurons in a reference structure of known volume (30 (X) ? 30 (Y) ? 10 (Z) lm). The average density of these cells was then multiplied by either the total volume of the DG (in the case of the number of mature granule neurons) or by the length of the subgranular zone (SGZ) (in the case of the number of DCX+ neuroblasts) in order to calculate the total number of cells per animal (Llorens-Martin et al., 2006). Bolos2018-->
The number of cells was counted in central and basolateral amygdala separately.
<!--PV+ interneurons were counted in the DG. 
To this end, the area including the GL, ML and the H was contoured on confocal stacks of images, and the number of PV+ cells surrounded by PNNs within that contour were counted in each stack of images. The number of cells was then divided by the drawn area, and cell density (cells/mm3) was represented in the graphs. Bolos2018 -->
In order to address <!-- microglial activation-->, we measured <!--CD68--> expression by immunohistochemistry in cells located in the central and basolateral amygdala.
Briefly, <!--confocal--> stacks of 20 images were obtained under a <!--LSM710 Zeiss confocal microscope (63x Oil immersion objective, Z-axis interval: 0.4 mm, XY dimensions: 79.38 mm).-->
Three-channel images were acquired <!--(DAPI, CD68 and Iba1)-->.
For each image, a fixed value threshold was applied to the Iba1 channel, and then the threshold image was converted in a Selection.
A Mean filter (2 pixels) was applied in order to delete precipitates of the secondary antibody.
The selection was then loaded in the CD68 channel.
Selections were inverted in both channels, and the exterior of the cells was filled with black paint.
Resulting images were then processed with the Just Another Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) in ImageJ, as previously described (Llorens-Martin et al., 2016).
The percentage of colocalization between the two channels (Iba1+ area that was also CD68+ (Mander’s coefficient M1)) is represented in the graphs.</p>

were performed “off-line” on captured images taken from stained sections. The total numbers of positively identified activated microglia expressing Iba-1 were counted manually in individual spinal cord sections from 3 rats in each treatment group. Microglia were defined as activated if they displayed a clearly swollen cell body with reduced processes, these differ from normal or resting microglia where cell bodies were largely absent and large ramified processes were displayed. Assessment was performed by inde- pendent blinded investigators who quantified the total number of activated microglia.

<p>We characterized mouse visual cortex neurons with a uniform experimental protocol and developed an unsupervised classification scheme of cell types based on electrophysiology and morphology.
Every aspect of the pipeline, from slice preparation, recording, and stimulation, to staining, imaging, reconstruction, and mapping of cells to a reference atlas, employed highly standardized and quality-controlled methodology.</p>
<p>All membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potential ( <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 11 mV).</p>
<p>Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.</p>
<p>Therefore, the amplitude (21–24) and the latency (25–28) of the first (AHPf) and second (AHPs) components of afterhyperpolarization was measured for the first two action potentials as the difference between spike threshold and the negative peak of the AHP (Kawaguchi, 1993). In some cortical neurons (Haj-Dahmane and Andrade, 1997), this complex repolarization is accompanied by a fast afterdepolarization (ADP). Its (29, 30) amplitude and (31, 32) latency were measured as the difference between the negative peak of the AHPf and the positive peak of the ADP and between the spike threshold and the peak of the ADP, respectively. When neurons did not exhibit AHPs or ADP, amplitude and latency were arbitrarily set to 0. <span class="citation">(<strong>karagiannis_2009?</strong>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Clustering</h2>
<p>Hierarchical clustering analysis. To classify the cells, an unsupervised clustering analysis ( Cauli et al., 2000 ; Jasnow et al., 2009 ; Sosulina et al., 2010 ) was performed by using squared Euclidean distances and Ward’s method ( Ward, 1963 ). Electrophysiological properties of CeL cells were tested for uniformity in their distributions. Each of the quantified 14 variables (listed in Table 1 ) was binned and tested by the D’Agostino– Pearson normality test, which is based on the assumption that a variable is normally distributed in a class. Variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were used for subsequent unsupervised clustering. Hierarchical clustering arranges data items into a tree-like dendrogram in which tree leaves represent data items and the length of tree edges between leaves represents the dissimilarity between data items. Tree leaves belonging to a subtree suggest high similarity and therefore form a group. Hierarchical clustering operates as follows. First, each CeL neuron was transformed into a 4D data point with variables of spike delay, ramp ratio, resting membrane potential (RMP), and rheobase. Before clustering, we first normalized variables into the range (0, 1) by performing min–max normalization. The distance between data points represents the dissimilarity between them; closer data points have higher similarity. Next, we clustered all the data points by the following iterative procedure. First, assign each data point to a cluster; every cluster therefore contains only one data point. Second, merge the two closest clusters into one cluster; therefore, Hou et al., 2016</p>

<p>For sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) staining <span class="citation">Kafitz <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span>, 250-μm-thick slices were prepared as for electrophysiology, with some slices incubated in 100 μM fluorocitrate (FC) for 30 min at room temperature as described above.
Slices were incubated in 1 μM SR101 (Sigma-Aldrich, <!-- kraj-->) in oxygenated ACSF for 20 min at 34 °C, then washed in ACSF for at least 10 min at 34 °C.
The slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, washed in PBS,<!--resectioned to 50-μm thickness,--> and processed for GFAP and NeuN immunoreactivity.
Z-stacks of images with an optical distance of 0.5 μm were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510) using a 40× oil-immersion objective.
Secondary antibodies tagged to fluorescein 488 and Cy3 were excited with 488- and
594- nm lasers and observed through 510–530 and 560–615
emission filters, respectively. A pinhole of 1 Airy unit and
identical settings for the detector gain and amplifier offset were
used to capture all confocal images</p>
<p>For determination of the amount of SR101-positive cells on the total number of cells exhibiting glial morphology, slices were double-labeled with SR101 and the ester form of sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI), a conventional Na+-selective fluorescent dye that exhibits similar properties as Fura-2 ( Meier et al., 2006 ). To this end, SBFI-AM (800 M) was repeatedly (1–5 s duration each) pressure-injected through a fine-tipped glass microelectrode into the stratum radiatum ( Stosiek et al., 2003 ). Injection was followed by a 45–60 min wash in normal ACSF at room temperature to allow for diffusion and de-esterification of the dye. Stacks of images (31 optical sections at 1 or 1.5 m thickness) were then taken at a custom build two-photon laser scanning microscope (excitation wavelength at 850 nm) based on an Olympus FV300 system (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany), coupled to a Mai-Tai Broadband laser (Spectra Physics, Darmstadt, Germany) and equipped with two fluorescence detection channels. Fluorescence emission of SBFI was collected between 400 and 590 nm, emission of SR101 was detected between 610 and 630 nm. Maximum intensity projections and analyses of the staining patterns were performed at montages of image stacks using “ImageJ”software. <span class="citation">Kafitz <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span></p>
<p>Experiments were carried out on acute tissue slices (250 m) of rat hippocampi harvested at postnatal days 3, 7, 15, and 24–27 as described earlier ( Meier et al., 2006 ). In brief, animals were decapitated and the hippocampi were rapidly removed. Slices of P3 and P7 animals were sectioned in ice-cold normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2and 5% CO2; pH 7.4). Following sectioning, slices were kept at 34◦C for 20 min in ACSF that contained 0.5–1 M sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), followed by a 10 min incubation in normal ACSF at 34◦C. Preparation of slices from animals older than 15 days as well as their incubation with SR101 at high temperature was performed in ACSF with a reduced Ca2+ concentration (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2and 5% CO2; pH 7.4). Afterwards, all slices were kept at room temperature until they were used for experiments, which were also performed at room temperature. Unless stated otherwise, … <span class="citation">Kafitz <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span></p>
<p>To overcome this problem, we adapted a protocol for application of the red fluorescent dye SR101, which was reported to stain astrocytes in the intact cortex of rodents ( Nimmerjahn et al., 2004 ), for use in acute slices of the rat hippocampus. SR101 is excited around 575 nm and its emission can be collected above 590 nm, making it suitable for use in combination with many available ion-selective dyes. Initial experiments were carried out employing a post-incubation with SR101-containing ACSF at room temperature for 20 min. Independent from the SR101 concentration used (from 100 M – as suggested by Nimmerjahn et al. (2004) for in vivo experiments – down to 0.5 M), this protocol resulted in an unspecific surface label of SR101. The vast majority of the unspecific SR101 staining most likely represented a nuclear label of superficial neurons whereas cells with typical astrocytic morphology were not stained (not shown). In stark contrast to this, we found that incubation of the slices right after their preparation in ACSF containing 500 nM–1 M SR101 for 20 min at high temperature (34◦C), resulted in a highly specific staining of cells with astrocytic morphology that was maintained for more than 8 h. The staining pattern of SR101 in slices obtained from animals at postnatal day 3 (P3, Fig. 1 A), P7 (not shown), P15 ( Fig. 1 B), as well as P24–27 (not shown) excluded virtually all cells of the stratum pyramidale , clearly indicating that SR101 exclusively labeled glial cells throughout development in this preparation <span class="citation">Kafitz <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span></p>
<p>FC stocks were prepared according to pub- lished procedures (28), and acute horizontal brain slices containing the nRT and VB were prepared following established methods (66). A subset of slices was treated with 100 μ M FC for at least 30 min at room temperature. For SR101 staining, slices were incubated in 1 μ M SR101 in oxygenated arti fi cial cerebrospinal fl uid (ACSF) for 20 min, washed in control ACSF for at least 10 min at 34 °C, and then fi xed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry. <span class="citation">(Christian &amp; Huguenard, 2013)</span></p>

<p>IHC was performed automated with image analysis software to exclude any bias and to be blinded. In the other cases, quantification has been validated by two independent people. Brightfield images have been acquired using a Widefield Observer (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a Vectra Polaris (Perkin Elmer) slide scanner. Fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Image analysis has been performed using open source Fiji32 and QuPath33 imaging software. For cell quantification of fluorescent images and brightfield images in which no automated quantification was possible, a minimum of eight randomly chosen regions of equal dimensions per patient and region were acquired. Total cell numbers per mm2 were calculated based on the image dimensions. For fluorescent images, z-stacks were collapsed to a maximum intensity projection and the number of cells was quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. For quantification of the single-channel brightfield images and the BaseScope IHC double-positive images, the number of cells was also quantified using the Fiji cell counter plugin. The average of these different regions was taken and considered as n = 1. Where possible, brightfield images were quantified automatically. Therefore, whole slides were scanned using a slide scanner. Using QuPath, a minimum of four random regions per sample and condition were annotated, and cells within these regions were quantified using the automated ‘positive cell detection’ plugin.</p>
<p>For the quantification of the duplex BaseScope, random brightfield images were acquired in the white matter of control donors. All cells with a positive BaseScope signal were quantified and represent 100% of labelled cells; the percentages of single- or double-positive cells were determined.</p>
<p>For the quantification of the differences in mRNA expression between MS lesions, whole sections were scanned with a slide scanner. Demyelinated lesions were detected by the absence of IHC staining for CNP. Within these regions, between 4 and 11 random regions of equal size were annotated using QuPath and the number of BaseScope-positive dots was quantified. The average of the random regions within 1 lesioned area was considered as n = 1.</p>
