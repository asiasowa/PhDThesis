<div id="dose" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> DOSE</h2>
<p>At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000; Cambien et al., 2001; Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2009)</p>
<p>While previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 causes an increase in intracellular calcium in neurons and other cell types (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Ragozzino et al., 2006) this effect of CX3CL1 becomes apparent at concentrations of 25 nM and higher (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004), well above the levels we investigated here and we observed no such increase in intracellular calcium. At a concentration of 2 nM, in both neurons and non-neurons, CX3CL1 pre-incubation suppressed glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium levels. These data are in good agreement with previous findings of a protective effect of inflammatory levels of CX3CL1 against glutamate excitotoxicity and glutamate NMDA receptor activation, in particular (Meucci et al., 1998; Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005), although, unlike the current work, the latter effect was linked to increased intracellular calcium (Ragozzino et al., 2006). Calcium oscillations in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells are important for cellular growth, migration and synaptic structural refinement (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Komuro and Rakic, 1998; Spitzer et al., 2000). Thus, the dampening of such signaling by CX3CL1 is suggestive of a role in stability of network connectivity and activity. Overall, the current data along with information in the published literature reveal that a role for CX3CL1 in control of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission during excitotoxic events can be extended to situations of synaptic plasticity required for normal functions such as memory formation.</p>
</div>
<div id="gabaa" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> GABA<sub>A</sub></h2>
<p>The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/chloride channel blocker, picrotoxin, used in the current studies would decrease GABAergic inhibitory transmission promoting depolarization in some cells with corresponding increases in intracellular calcium (Antonucci et al., 2012). Thus, the current work suggests GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/chloride channel activity within the hippocampal neuronal network must be intact for CX3CL1 to attenuate glutamatergic neurotransmission or LTP.
This situation is remarkably similar to that described for CX3CL1 inhibition of serotonergic neurons of the Raphe nucleus (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009). While this effect may relate to basal inhibitory tone, CX3CL1 could actually be enhancing GABAA receptor function. For example, CX3CL1 enhances phosphorylation and activation of Akt in neurons and this serine/threonine kinase has been associated with phosphorylation of the GABAA beta2 receptor subunit, a modification that enhances activity of the receptor (Meucci et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2003). Moreover, several signaling systems can enhance GABAmediated inhibition through promotion of rapid insertion of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors into the post-synaptic plasma membrane (Wan et al., 1997; Nusser et al., 1998; Mizoguchi et al., 2003; Jovanovic et al., 2004) - Sheridan2014</p>
<!-- randomowe zdania dla konstrukcji? 

By employing transgenic mice with chronically elevated expression of CCL2 specifically in astrocytes, it was showed that CCL2 reduced synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, whereas it enhanced short-term synaptic plasticity [@nelson_2011].
However, although both acute and chronic CCL2 leads to presynaptic alternations in glutamatergic input to the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the molecular mechanism underlying this discrepancy remains unclear. 
As those experiments varied regarding: (i) CCL2 application (acute vs. chronic), (ii) source (astrocytic vs. bath-applied during recordings), (iii) method (patch-clamp vs. extracellular recordings), more studies clarifying this issue are needed.-->
<!-- Glu - connexins - ACKR3 - astrocytes
 Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].-->
<!--Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].
It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis.-->
<!-- Glu - oligodendrocytes - maybe some oligodenrocytes have some receptors of interest? 
The importance of oligodendrocytes in the regulation of synaptic transmission is just now being appreciated, and only scarce evidence has been reported so far. 
However, few studies suggested two molecular targets, which may be involved in this phenomenon: BDNF and glutamine synthetase (GS).
Recently, it was shown that oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF might function *via* presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to ensure fast, reliable neurotransmitter release in the developing brain [@jang_2019].
Moreover, this mechanism was recently described to play a role in cognitive impairment [@geraghty_2019].<!-- chyba BDNF derived from microglia 
Another promising molecule is GS.
The study illustrated that depletion of OL GS disrupts neuronal glutamate signaling with accompanying changes in behavioral function [@xin_2019].
Interestingly, OLs survival and myelination were unaffected, thus demonstrating a myelin-independent role for oligodendrocytes in supporting glutamate signaling in the brain [@xin_2019]. -->
<!-- GABA and microglia / astrocytes / ? -->
<!-- In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018]. -->
<!-- astrocytic GABA transporters -->
<!-- microglia and inhibitory synaptic transmission -->
<!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. 
In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. 
Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. 
However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->
<!-- chemokines modulate serotonin, therefore ....-->
<!-- These effects of CCL2 on 5-HT neurons should lead to a reduction of 5-HT release in projection areas such as the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions implicated in the regulation of emotional expression and memory processes affected in major depression.-->
<!-- analogous? -->
<!-- It was suggested that CCR5 may also serve 
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function. -->
<!-- introduction of discussion? -->
<p>The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission.
Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release <span class="citation">Ragozzino <em>et al.</em> (2002)</span>, modulate the functional properties of ionic channels <span class="citation">Oh <em>et al.</em> (2002)</span> and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes <span class="citation">(Lax <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>.
In addition, the chemokine system can alter the actions of neuronally active pharmacological agents such as opioids and the cannabinoid system <span class="citation">(Heinisch <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Moreover, chemokine receptor knockout mice (CCR6, CCR7, CXCR5) have recently been shown to exhibit behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes of relevance to psychiatric disorders, which suggests their essential role in physiological conditions <span class="citation">Stuart <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>.</p>

In our previous studies, we concluded that the effects of CXCL12 on DG neural stem cells were likely to be mediated post-synaptically (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). Indeed, CXCR4 receptors are clearly expressed by these cells (Tran et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). It is also clear from our experiments that adult neural stem cells express the receptor (or at least ‘a receptor’) for CXCL14. Thus, CXCL14 increased [Ca2+]iin these cells, one of the cardinal signs of chemokine receptor signaling. Given the fact that neural progenitor cells express the receptor for CXCL14 and the observation that the chemokine reduces the amplitude of GABAergic PSCs recorded from these cells one might conclude that the effect of CXCL14 is at least partly mediated post-synaptically. However, it is quite possible that a pre-synaptic effect is also involved. Precise identification of the mechanism by which CXCL14 produces its effect will have to await further studies on identifying its receptor and its location in the DG. -->

Additionally, astrocytes are known to secrete chemokines like CCL5 and CCL3 that may bind CCR5 on neurons and mediate synaptic transmission and plasticity through mechanisms ranging from the prevention of extrasynaptic neurotransmitter diffusion and neurotransmitter clearance to the modulation of synaptic release probability -->
<!-- However, as adenosine was suggested to be a downstream element of both CX3CL1 and CXCL16 signaling, along with the facts that CXCL16 was shown to act directly on astrocytes leading to a secretion of CCL2 [@rosito_2012], and microglia, together with astrocytes, were identified as important cellular sources of CCL2, glial modulation of the observed effect is very plausible./// [@lax_2002], -->

CXCL12 a increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12 a . It is therefore likely that CXCL12 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.0.1</span> CX3CR1, microglia and stress</h4>
<p>Although CX3CR1 is widely acknowledged as pivotal for brain development and function, evidence on how it regulates microglial differentiation under psychosocial stress is limited (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017).
We hereby provide evidence that CX3CR1 expression was dampened in both CRS animals and schizophrenia patients, and CX3CR1 gene had less interactions with other brain genes in schizophrenia; this receptor was further found to be important for CD206+ microglial subtype differentiation and morphological process arborization, and its deficiency resulted in social dominancy impairment.</p>
<p>A handful of studies have utilized CX3CR1-deficient mice to explore the role of this receptor in chronic stress, regarding its regulation by stress (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017), its importance for microglial morphological ramification and phagocytosis (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017), and its beneficial versus detrimental role in brain and behavioral responses to physio-pathological (Gunner et al., 2019; Lowery et al., 2017; Schecter et al., 2017) or psychosocial stressors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Winkler et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2013).
Among these, studies have showed that CX3CR1 rescued chronic stress-induced increase in microglial phagocytosis (Milior et al., 2016) and decrease in hippocampal long-term potentiation (Milior et al., 2016), while improving neurogenesis and short-term memory (Rimmerman et al., 2017).
CX3CR1-deficiency caused social withdrawal and increased repetitive behavior (Zhan et al., 2014), as well as increased fear acquisition and reinstatement (Schubert et al., 2018), implicating a beneficial function of CX3CR1 for the stressed brain.
However, other studies showed that CX3CR1-deficient mice were resistant to chronic stress-induced depressive-like and anxiety behaviors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2017), jointly implying a detrimental role of CX3CR1 in psychiatric disorders. <span class="citation">(<strong>paiirainen_2021?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>We previously found that microglia from mice with high-anxiety traits were prone to polarization from a CD206+to an MHCII+phenotype (Li et al., 2014), and identified candidate innate immune genes involved in synaptic plasticity (Ma et al., 2015).
We also observed the regional heterogeneity of microglia and its potential importance for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders (Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020; Xuan et al., 2019). <span class="citation">(<strong>paiirainen_2021?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>Considering the key role of microglia in sensing neuronal microenvironment ( Davalos et al., 2005 ), it was not surprising to discover that some of the effects of CXCL16 are also mediated by these cells. <!-- Trettel 2020 --><!-- analogous?--></p>
<p>However, we acknowledge that minocycline, in addition to impairing microglial proinflammatory and phagocytic activity, has many other unrelated effects; however, our use of ICV injection at least eliminated the peripheral effects of minocycline (Brundula et al., 2002; Giuliani et al., 2005). Thus, to determine further whether microglia specifically control synaptic transmission in the BLA, we injected Saporin toxin conjugated to macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1, integrin CD11b/ CD18 receptor localized to microglia) directly into the BLA of 8-week-old C57BL/6N females to transiently deplete microglia. IgG-Saporin, which does not bind to any specific receptor, was used as a control.;;</p>
<p>It should be noted that their spine morphology is tightly correlated with their synaptic function <span class="citation">(Nishiyama, 2019)</span>. <!-- Therefore, it is plausible that long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two major forms of synaptic plasticity, are correlated with the spine enlargement and shrinkage, respectively [@nishiyama_2019]. --></p>
<p>However, considering that dendritic spines reflect the structural level of synaptic plasticity along with extensive evidence of chemokine actions on excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, it is tempting to speculate that chemokines actions on dendritic spines are still unexplored.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.0.2</span> Autism, microglia, dendritic spines, social</h4>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by various genetic and environmental factors that result in synaptic abnormalities. ASD development is suggested to involve microglia, which have a role in synaptic re fi nement during development. Autophagy and related pathways are also suggested to be involved in ASDs. However, the precise roles of microglial autophagy in synapses and ASDs are unknown. Here, we show that microglial autophagy is involved in synaptic re fi nement and neurobehavior regulation. We found that deletion of atg7, which is vital for autophagy, from myeloid cell-speci fi c lysozyme M-Cre mice resulted in social behavioral defects and repetitive behaviors, characteristic features of ASDs. These mice also had increases in dendritic spines and synaptic markers and altered connectivity between brain regions, indicating defects in synaptic re fi nement. Synaptosome degradation was impaired in atg7-de fi cient microglia and immature dendritic fi lopodia were increased in neurons co-cultured with atg7-de fi cient microglia. <!-- kim 2017--></p>
