<p>Thus, the abovementioned findings strongly indicate that CXCL12 could modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission.
Consistently, in the cerebellum, CXCR4 activation results in a decrease in NMDAR function, and thus, leads to synaptic depression <span class="citation">(Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>.<!-- , probably by CXCL12-induced reduction in NR2B expression subunit of NMDAR [@nicolai_2010]. na ile to prawda? nie bardziej aktywacja NR2B przyczynia się do LTD? sprawdzić -->
Moreover, CXCR4 receptors were shown to be presynaptically located in hippocampal noradrenergic and glutamatergic nerve endings.
They were connected with presynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting that CXCR4-NMDAR interactions can regulate both noradrenaline and glutamate exocytosis <span class="citation">(Di Prisco <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
In addition, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the substantia nigra (SN), the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN <span class="citation">(Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010)</span>.
<!--CXCR4 is also widely expressed on microglia, and thus being able to react to astrocytic glutamate. najlepiej rozbudować -->
By acting on the presynaptic site, CXCL12 affects the activity of serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons, thereby modulating the release of neuroactive molecules <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, CXCL12 is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: <span class="citation">Bhattacharyya <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span>).
However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin, MCH, and DA<!-- dodać inne + cytowania-->), <!--together with ...., -->postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved in this phenomenon.
For instance, in MCH neurons, CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels of the action potential <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>, or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents <span class="citation">(Guyon, Rovère, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering that the hypothalamus, a brain region comprised of different nuclei and several neuronal populations producing neuropeptides, is critically involved in regulating major neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and stress, one could speculate that CXCL12 signaling may be involved in these functions.
In line with this notion, CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia.
Not only a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the PVN and perifornical lateral hypothalamus, but also an intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus <span class="citation">(Poon <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior. <!-- Both SDF-1 and GABA have been shown to regulate the rate of GnRH neuronal migration by accelerating and slowing migration, respectively. As such, this system was used to explore the mechanism by which these molecules act to produce coordinated cell movement during development. In the present study, GABA and SDF-1 are shown to exert opposite effects on the speed of cell movement by activating depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signaling pathways, GABA via changes in chloride, and SDF-1 via changes in potassium. GABA and SDF-1 were also found to act synergistically to promote linear rather than random movement. The simultaneous activation of these signaling pathways, therefore, results in tight control of cellular speed and improved directionality along the migratory pathway of GnRH neurons. -->
Importantly, depending on the concentration, CXCL12 is thought to exert opposite effects on the action potential discharge in MCH neurons <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>, which may have functional consequences on the activity of neuroendocrine functions.
Precisely, CXCR4 was reported to be tonically active at low physiological concentrations, constantly exerting its action on MCH neurons.<!-- whereas its activation lead to ... -->
Consistently, under basal conditions, those cells showed more hyperpolarized membrane potential than orexin neurons, which do not express CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Eggermann <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>The dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of both pre- and post-synaptic actions of CXCL12.
CXCL12 was reported to enhance the frequency of sIPSCs and mIPSCs in this region, indicating presynaptic mechanisms, which is in line with the documented presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
In addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 could act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of HVA currents <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Consistent with this data, by using unilateral intranigral or intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12, a further study has illustrated that this chemokine triggered contralateral turns in circling behavior <span class="citation">(Skrzydelski <em>et al.</em>, 2007)</span>.
Of note, considering that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in dopamine neurons<!-- citations -->, it is tempting to speculate that this chemokine may act in an autocrine manner <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
<!--For instance, electrophysiological recordings of supraoptic neurons have demonstrated that CXCL12 decreases the electrical activity of AVP neurons *via* CXCR4, resulting in reduced AVP release [@callewaere_2006].
Importantly, These findings also elucidate that CXCL12 cognate receptor, CXCL12, may be implicated in the autocrine regulation of these neurons. --></p>
<p>Interestingly, following the CXCL12 application, SN dopaminergic neurons have shown an increase in an inward current <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
This effect was independent of the CXCR4 receptor, action potential-dependent sodium channel, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>, suggesting that this chemokine may induce glutamate release from astrocytes.
Consistently, immunohistological analyses revealed that astrocytes in this structure lacked CXCR4, further supporting the possibility of astrocytic mediation <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
Considering the abovementioned expression of another ACKR3 receptor in astrocytes, this receptor may be responsible for this CXCL12-induced increase in glutamate.
Alternatively, it may also be mediated on CXCR4-expressing microglial cells.
However, the exact mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release still warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Unlike in the SN, astrocytes cultured from the cerebral cortex presented the high expression of CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Calì <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Upon CXCL12-induced stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes, (i) the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of glutamate, regulated by exocytosis on a millisecond time scale <span class="citation">(Calì <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Calì &amp; Bezzi, 2010)</span>, and (ii) the release of prostaglandins and TNFα <span class="citation">(Bezzi <em>et al.</em>, 2001)</span>.
It is widely accepted that TNFα mediates synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity leading to the adjustment of synaptic strength <span class="citation">(Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006)</span>, and mainly astrocytes, have been identified as the main source of the TNFα in the CNS.
Therefore, by modulating TNFα levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity <span class="citation">(Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Convincing evidence illustrates that opioid receptors and CKRs are often co-expressed in the same neuron and can directly interact, thus each influencing the function of the other.
In this regard, the most studied mechanism is the heterologous desensitization, where the activation of one type of GPCR receptor leads to the inactivation of another GPCR receptor present in the same cell.
Consistent with this idea, following CXCL12 exposure, the heterologous desensitization of opioid receptors has been linked to functional outcomes at the cellular (e.g., reduced chemotaxis <span class="citation">(Szabo <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>) and electrophysiological (e.g., decreased morphine-induced hyperpolarization in PAG neurons in the presence of CXCL12 <span class="citation">(Heinisch <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>) levels.
In addition, a recent study has provided extensive<!--novel?new?--> evidence that ACKR3 is a chemokine receptor with the ability to bind opioid peptides; however, opioid binding did not trigger downstream signaling through this receptor <span class="citation">(Meyrath <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
Thus, it is suggested that ACKR3 serves scavenger functions for many opioids, especially enkephalins and dynorphins, by reducing their availability for their classical opioid receptors <span class="citation">(Meyrath <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
Consistent with this idea, ACKR3 was reported to bind intermediate opioid peptides, specifically BAM22 and peptide E, which results in enhancement of circadian glucocorticoid oscillation in the adrenal glands, and, therefore, anxiolytic-like behavior <span class="citation">(Ikeda <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>. <!-- może poprawic albo wrocić do innej wersji? -->
BAM22 and peptide E were shown to be released under a condition named subcapsular cell hyperplasia (SCH) <span class="citation">(Ikeda <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>, which is a pathohistological change of adrenal tissue.
SCH cells lack prohormone convertase, an enzyme required for processing these proteins to mature enkephalins <span class="citation">(Ikeda <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Therefore, this study highlights the functional relevance of chemokine and opioid systems interactions.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also worth noting that the profile of CXCL12-induced actions is similar to “sickness behavior.”
It is a physiological and psychological state characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines <span class="citation">(Dantzer, 2001; Dantzer &amp; Kelley, 2007)</span>.
Considering that CXCL12 was shown to modulate the release of 5-HT in the DRN as well as neuropeptides in the hypothalamus, it could affect mood-related and feeding behavior, observed in depression <span class="citation">(Maes <em>et al.</em>, 1998)</span>.
Thus, the effect of CXCL12 on serotonergic neurons in the DRN could underlie depressive symptoms, as dysfunction of the serotoninergic systems is implicated in depression.
<!-- Moreover, amygdala --></p>
<p>Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit. <!-- napisać lepsze podsumowanie....

<p>Amygdala is strategically positioned to regulate homeostatic function, and thus, one may speculate that it would be involved in integrating signals from endocrine and immune systems. <!-- jakieś lepsze intro... As being strategically positioned to be a hub, amygdala together with playing homeostatic function, one may speculate that i że several evidence i wymienić od 1 2 3-->
It is supported by several lines of evidence. <!-- review how immune system sub the brain -->
First, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages CeA and, to a lesser extent, the BLA <span class="citation">(Frenois <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Harrison <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Engler <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Peripheral signal of immune activation is thought to be mediated either <em>via</em> activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting by proinflammatory cytokines and/or glucocorticoids to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to the amygdala, predominantly its central part (for a review: <span class="citation">Vitkovic <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>; <span class="citation">Critchley &amp; Harrison (2013)</span>).
Alternatively, this signal activates the HPA axis, which is also connected with the amygdala <span class="citation">(Herman <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Green <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Di Iorio <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.
Moreover, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Second, mounting evidence illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part.
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders <span class="citation">(Tovote <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Girgenti <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>, epilepsy <span class="citation">(Fabene <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Roseti <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Tian <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Suleymanova, 2021)</span>, obesity <span class="citation">(Guillemot-Legris &amp; Muccioli, 2017; Kawamura <em>et al.</em>, 2021)</span>, pain <span class="citation">(Old &amp; Malcangio, 2012; Mélik Parsadaniantz <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019; Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>, drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; <span class="citation">Coller &amp; Hutchinson (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Freeman <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Jacobsen <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Wang <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.</p>

<p>Finally, several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA <span class="citation">(Nishiyori <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span><!-- dodać CXCR4, CXCR7 CYTOWANIA-->, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala.
Surprisingly, despite many similarities between the amygdala network and chemokine system dysfunctions, the electrophysiological role of chemokines in this structure is still unclear.<!--  --></p>

<!-- ####  CXCL12- and CX3CL1-induced regulation of neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication {#example}

Here, I will introduce a simplified model of coordinated actions of neuron-glia interactions fine-tuned by chosen chemokines and gliotransmitters. 

As mentioned above, CX3CL1 is the most widely studied chemokines in relation to neuron–microglia crosstalk and regulation of microglial activity. 
Accumulating evidence illustrates that many environmental triggers can up-regulate CX3CL1 expression, including an insult [@hughes_2002], learning [@sheridan_2014], or the presence of another chemokine, CXCL12, *via* its action on neuronal ADAM17 [@cook_2010] (Fig....).

CX3CL1 was shown to exert neuroprotective actions against  Glu-induced  excitotoxicity, with  mechanisms  fully  dependent  on  A~1~R  [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010] and at least partially dependent on  A~3~R  [@rosito_2012; @rosito_2014].
In contrast, NMDA-induced toxicity, mainly mediated by NR2B-containing extrasynaptic  NMDARs, was reported to require A~2A~R and the presence  of D-serine [@scianni_2013; @lauro_2014].
These results highlight that modulation of glial function by adenosine is essential in the context of neuroprotection, as both microglia and astrocytes release it as a gliotransmitter.

Additionally, it is well-established that astrocytes might also exert a neuroprotective role upon brain insult by buffering extracellular Glu [@blanger_2009]. 
Evidence illustrated that CX3CL1, acting on microglia, induced the production and release of adenosine that exerted their effects on astrocytes by binding to A~1~R (Fig. 3D), and consequently inducing the up-regulation of the astrocytic GLT-1 transporter (Fig. 3E, @catalano_2013).
Microglia can also release CXCL12, which then acts, for example, *via* astrocytic CXCR4 and, in turn, produces TNFα, leading to remyelination (see Fig...; @bezzi_2001, @cunha_2020).

To sum up, the  mentioned above findings strongly support the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines are key communicating molecules between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserving brain functions.
Please note that this is a simplification of neuron-microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in the context of neuroprotection, and many other factors and connections are omitted for the sake of clarity. -->
<!--### Chemokines modulates behavior {#behavior}

Since mounting evidence supports the notion that chemokines coordinate several brain circuits of behavioral relevance, including hippocampus, DRN, SN, hypothalamus, it may indicate their contribution to these behaviors.
Consistent with this idea, disturbances of several chemokines/chemokine receptor axes were implicated in the pathophysiology of neurobiological disorders [@paolicelli_2014; @poon_2016; @stuart_2015].
Moreover, despite increasing evidence about the chemokine system's role in mediating homeostatic brain functions, the mechanisms underlying chemokines regulation of behavior under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. 
Hence, here I discuss a handful of studies on the regulation of chemokines on various types of behavior, such as learning and memory, social interactions, locomotor activity, anxiety. 
Results from those studies are summarized in Table 3. 

To sum up, these findings reinforce the idea that chemokines and their receptors are involved in higher brain functions regulating many types of behavior, including cognitive, motor, and emotional behavioral effects.
However, to date, very little is known about their cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological profile with regard to potential interaction with glia to put these results in a broader context. // and glial-mediated mechanisms to put these results in a broader context.///

// dobre połączenie z AMYGDALA///
Although many brain regions have been found to participate in anxiety regulation it is commonly accepted that among them the amygdala plays a prominent role (Canteras et al., 2010; Davis and Whalen, 2001; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Engin and Treit, 2008; Everitt et al., 2003; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000, 2007; McNally et al., 2011; Pape and Paré, 2010; Paré et al., 2004; Pérez de la Mora et al., 2008, 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2009).

Several behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, commonly occur in mice with CX3CR1 deletion. -->
<!-- 
All neuronal circuits of higher animals comprise excitatory and inhibitory neurons forming intense feed-forward and feedback connections [@mohler_1990, @ferrante_2009, @roth_2012].
However, the precise control of network operations would not be possible without interneurons.
Although they constitute only 20-30% of all cells in cortical circuits, this small, diverse group of inhibitory neurons enables higher brain functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, or social interaction (for a review: @mederos_2019). 
Through inhibition, GABAergic interneurons can shape the circuit activity controlling (1) frequency of surrounding pyramidal neurons, (2) network excitation level by feed-forward mechanism, and (3) synchronized oscillation events [@mederos_2019]. 
The importance of interneurons in relation to network functioning illustrates the highly controlled manner by which interneurons connect with other neurons [@tremblay_2016]. 

##### Synaptic scaling {#scal}

In order to prevent the destabilizing component of Hebbian plasticity in network function, neurons are able to sense their excitability and trigger negative-feedback homeostatic mechanisms to counteract perturbations in synaptic activity and restrain it within a dynamical but physiological range [@field_2020]. 
Recent accumulating data also highlight the essential role of glial cells, as they are equipped with, for instance, glutamate transporters to control the concentration of glutamate and other neurotransmitters in the microenvironment. 
Importantly, stable but flexible neural activity is fundamental for proper brain function and support of animal behavior, depending on a dynamic interface between homeostatic synaptic  plasticity  mechanisms  and  Hebbian  forms  of plasticity [@field_2020; @tremblay_2016].-->
<!-- neuroactive substances-->
<p>Taken together, as expected from their complex expression of cellular pattern and dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 with their corresponding receptors modulate intrinsic membrane properties, synaptic transmission, and gliotransmission by implementing diverse cell- and region-specific mechanisms.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Amygdala</h2>
<p>The amygdala is a brain structure located in medial temporal lobe associated with surprisingly distinct array of behaviors, such as learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction <span class="citation">(LeDoux, 2000; Ehrlich <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Roozendaal <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Herry <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
<!-- adaptation and well-conserved -->
<!-- learning -->
Surprisingly, despite this variety of functions, the amygdala is well-conserved throughout evolution.
Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals (for a review: <span class="citation">Janak &amp; Tye (2015)</span>).
It is speculated that this may be due to adaptive value of those phenomena.
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie -->
For example, during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior <span class="citation">(LeDoux, 2000; Janak &amp; Tye, 2015)</span>.<!-- Most of amygdala-related processes are linked to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning (also known as Pavlovian conditioning) and its malfunctions. This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning. -->
Analogously, reward-induced conditioning responses<!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues-->lead to a cue-triggered behavior <span class="citation">(Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.<!-- nowsze cytowania  -->
Thus, both learning about danger and potential rewards are adaptive and engages the amygdala <span class="citation">(Janak &amp; Tye, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>These distinct behaviors are believed to be reflected by amygdalar widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape &amp; Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>) as well as is complex inner structure.<!-- Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have ....further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. -->
This limbic region is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of nuclei, which can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>).
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) <span class="citation">(McDonald, 1998; Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Here, the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA), and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers (<span class="citation">Bocchio <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Ehrlich <em>et al.</em> (2009)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape &amp; Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Spampanato <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).

<p>Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, have been dissecting how genetically targeted cellular activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for example, <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>). <!-- lepiej to napisać ... with ,-->
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the amygdala’s role, anatomy, and physiology.
The physiological and morphological properties of neurons in relation to specific nuclei are shown in Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>, whereas their inputs, outputs and intra-connectivity are depicted in Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>.</p>
<div id="BLA" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA)</h3>
<p>The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
All these nuclei are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter this term will be used.
The BLA is considered to be the main input nuclei of the amygdala (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah &amp; Lopez De Armentia (2003)</span>). <!-- point of the entry of ///  for cortical and thalamic sensory inputs into the amygdala, which form axonal bundles and enter *via* external and internal capsule, respectively-->
Briefly, multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA.
It is carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory, associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala <em>via</em> the external or internal capsules (for reviews: <span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>). <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review? // thalamic nuclei and secondary or higher-order sensory cortices besides the associative cortices-->
<!--In most cases, those afferents project to both principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons (see Fig. \@ref(fig:amygdalaconnect), part a).  In addition to pyramidal-like neurons, local interneurons also receive, to some extend, inputs from cortical and thalamic afferents [@smith_2000; @woodson_2000]. For example, CB-expressing interneurons receive about a half of the cortical inputs [@unal_2014], whereas thalamic neurons project to less than 1% of BLA interneurons [@szinyei_2000]. -->
A large body of evidence highlights the role of these terminals in the acquisition of fear and appetitive<!--reward-related?--> conditioning, which is associated with synaptic potentiation in the BLA <span class="citation">(Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>. <!-- Moreover, increasing evidence shows that distinct subpopulations of BLA differentially encode valence. Accordingly, optogenetic studies delineated that the BLA-NAc pathway is preferentially excited by appetitive stimuli, whereas BLA-CeA connections are preferentially activated by aversive ones [@beyeler_2016; @namburi_2015; @pignatelli_2019]. -->
In addition, this nucleus is strongly innervated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part a).
Specifically, this region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2) serotonergic projections originating from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), (3) dense dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN), and (4) projections from the basal forebrain (<span class="citation">Prager <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> and references therein).</p>
<p>This amygdalar complex displays cortical-like characteristics based on its developmental origin and structural organization <span class="citation">(Waclaw <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>, although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization <span class="citation">(Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014)</span>.
Accordingly, both principal cells (PCs) and interneurons show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal counterparts.</p>
<p>Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).<!--  see figure? -->
Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections (<span class="citation">Faber <em>et al.</em> (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Paré <em>et al.</em> (1995)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).
The degree of this adaptation forms a continuum. <!-- the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms a continuum: -->
At one end, cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation <span class="citation">(Funahashi <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Faber <em>et al.</em>, 2001)</span>. <!-- może jakiś figure i trochę lepiej napisać? see Fig. in methods?--></p>
<p>On the other hand, BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of parameters, which is a subject of many excellent reviews <span class="citation">(Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Prager <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Hájos, 2021)</span>.
Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population, and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons <span class="citation">(Kemppainen &amp; Pitkänen, 2000; McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously <em>in vivo</em> at high frequencies (10-15 Hz) <span class="citation">(Paré <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons <span class="citation">(Group <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span> but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004)</span>. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns <span class="citation">(Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>. <!--more recent reviews-->
Some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells (<span class="citation">Rainnie <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>), whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation <span class="citation">(Jasnow <em>et al.</em>, 2009)</span>.
However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear.
Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: <span class="citation">Spampanato <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>, <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Also contrary to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004)</span>.
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and chandelier cells (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).
Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology <span class="citation">(Klenowski <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons.</p>

In addition, principal cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons (<span class="citation">Szinyei <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c).</p>
<p>BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their primary source of GABAergic inputs (<span class="citation">Bienvenu <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>; <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Rainnie <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c).</p>
<p>Principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA <!-- sprawdzić and  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses.
However, further ultrastructural analyses revealed that distinct subtypes of interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target of PCs.
Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; <span class="citation">McDonald &amp; Betette (2001)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2005)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>).
Given that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs’ spiking output and timing <span class="citation">(Woodruff <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons (<span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c).
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials<!-- directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in -->, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Similar to excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines.
Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA.
The regulation of the BLA network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by <span class="citation">Prager <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>, as it is beyond the topic of this dissertation.</p>
<p>In addition to their strong regulation of PCs’ activity, BLA interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron contacts.
Electron microscopy analyses revealed that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being mediated by gap junctions <span class="citation">(Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.
While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among BLA interneurons remains high, but mainly within the same subtype <span class="citation">(Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Woodruff &amp; Sah, 2007b)</span>.
This notion was further supported by a study using a conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical synapses (<span class="citation">Andrási <em>et al.</em> (2017)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c).</p>
<p>Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors.
In general, activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-dependent, and slow, GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor-dependent components <span class="citation">(Washburn &amp; Moises, 1992)</span>.
Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory components originate from<!-- are due to activity of?--> distinct subpopulations of interneurons <span class="citation">(Sugita <em>et al.</em>, 1992)</span>.</p>
<p>The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties <!-- expression of neuromodulators? -->contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations and flow of information.
These are often thought to be comprised of feedback inhibition <span class="citation">(Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Unal <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>, feedforward inhibition <span class="citation">(Lang &amp; Paré, 1997; Popescu &amp; Paré, 2011; Bazelot <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, and disinhibition <span class="citation">(Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span> (for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a)</span>).
Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA.
Indeed, accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of emotional learning in the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004; Pelletier &amp; Paré, 2004; Bauer <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Klenowski <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections, thereby modulating several behavioral responses <span class="citation">(Bauer <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Courtin <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Davis <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Zheng <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>It should be also noted that despite being the main input of the amygdaloid complex, the BLA sends a few projections.
Despite to its reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NAc), indicated as crucial in reward-seeking behavior <span class="citation">(Stuber <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Namburi <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Beyeler <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Nevertheless, the BLA predominantly projects to the extended amygdala (see Section <a href="cxcl12.html#CeA">2.2.3</a>), which is the BNST and the CeA (see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b and c).
Those connections are associated with anxiety and social interactions <span class="citation">(Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Felix-Ortiz <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Felix-Ortiz &amp; Tye, 2014; Felix-Ortiz <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.<!-- For example, fear conditioning was reported to strengthen the excitatory synapses from the BLA onto both SOM- and CRF-containing cells in the CeL [@fadok_2017; @li_2013a]. 
In line with these findings, the study conducted by @tye_2011 nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals was linked to a high-anxiety behavioral phenotype. Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feedforward inhibition of the CeM [@ciocchi_2010; @tye_2011]. -->
<!-- There is a small fraction of long-range inhibitory interneurons, targeting the entorhinal cortex [@mcdonald_2015] or the basal forebrain [@mcdonald_2012] as well as mPFC and periaqueductal grey (PAG) [@sun_2019]. -->
Notably, the CeA can be innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto CeA neurons (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span>, <span class="citation">Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah (2004)</span> or indirectly <em>via</em> GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward inhibition (<span class="citation">Jüngling <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer <em>et al.</em> (1999)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b).</p>
</div>
<div id="ITCs" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Intercalated cell masses</h3>
<p>Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the BLA.
Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into (1) lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITC<sub>L</sub>), bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITC<sub>MP</sub>, localized within the intermediate<!--internal?--> capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA,<!--medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) --> and (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITC<sub>VM</sub>) (<span class="citation">Mańko <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Millhouse (1986)</span>, <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).</p>
<p>Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (10–15 µm) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle <span class="citation">(Nitecka &amp; Ben-Ari, 1987; McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993)</span>, and larger (&gt;50 µm) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices (<span class="citation">Bienvenu <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>,<a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).
Moreover, ITCs express the highest density of µ-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala <span class="citation">(Marowsky <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Jacobsen <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Pape &amp; Pare, 2010; Palomares-Castillo <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.
Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1α (mGluR1α), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors α1 subunit, and PV <span class="citation">(Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
Electrophysiologically, both types of cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance, higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA interneurons <span class="citation">(Royer <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Geracitano <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Busti <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Mańko <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each cluster but also between clusters.
For example, ITC<sub>L</sub> interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs <span class="citation">(Strobel <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, thereby providing feedforward inhibition to BLA principal neurons <span class="citation">(Marowsky <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.<!-- sprawdzić ostatnie cytowanie lITC neurons receive auditory input from cortical and thalamic regions. [@strobel_2015] ///-->
On the other hand, the BLA mainly targets more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an inhibitory interface<!--gate--> between the BLA and CeA (<span class="citation">Busti <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Marowsky <em>et al.</em> (2005)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b).
<!--In addition, ITC~PM~ neurons were suggested to directly inhibit the ITC~VM~ cluster, resulting in disinhibition of the CeA and, thus, facilitation of fear responses [@busti_2011; @royer_2000].-->
Hence, intercalated cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially by gating CeA output.</p>
<!--On the other hand, intercalated cells, which were shown to also play a crucial role in fear-conditioning, form GABAergic synapses on CeL neurons (see Section \@ref(ITCs) and Fig. \@ref(fig:amygdalaconnect), part b).
Notably, it was shown that the composition of GABA receptors in those synapses differs depending on their subcellular target [@delaney_2001]. 
Specifically, CeL soma receives synapses containing only GABA~A~ receptors, whereas additional GABA~C-like~ receptors, similar to bicuculline-insensitive retinal GABA~C~ receptors, have been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses formed by intercalated cells onto dendrites of CeL neurons [@delaney_2001].
These results indicate that different compositions of GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of this region. -->
<!-- Furthermore, CeL, especially its PKCδ-expressing neurons, was revealed to be involved in feeding behavior.
In line with this result, optogenetic excitation of PKCδ-containing neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice [@cai_2014].
Conversely, in mice, reducing the activity of PKCδ-immunopositive cells in CeL was shown to reverse the effects of decreased feeding induced by sickness or unpalatable tastes [@cai_2014]. 
Hence, these findings indicate that CeL, especially the PKCδ  subpopulation, is activated by anorexigenic signals.  -->
<!-- We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOM neurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOM neurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).-->

<div id="CeA" class="section level3" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Central amygdala</h3>
<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions <span class="citation">(McDonald, 1982b; Jolkkonen &amp; Pitkänen, 1998; Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL <span class="citation">(Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014)</span>.
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense intra-connectivity (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span> and for a review: <span class="citation">Fox <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Gilpin <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>).
However, here we focus mainly on the CeA. <!-- In particular, while the lateral part of the BLA preferentially projects to CeL, CeM neurons receive more substantial inputs from the basal nucleus [@duvarci_2014; @krettek_1978]. --></p>
<p>Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>. <!-- nie wiem czy dobre cytowania-->
However, similar to the BLA, there are also exceptions from this oversimplified model, and both CeM and CeL receive direct projections outside the amygdala (see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part a)).
Among others, neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT, <span class="citation">Do-Monte <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Penzo <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>), the BNST <span class="citation">(Gungor <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, parabrachial nucleus (PBN; <span class="citation">Carter <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>) or oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus <span class="citation">(Knobloch <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span> sends projections to this region, influencing diverse set of behaviors.<!-- poprawić końcówkę?--><!-- Although there was a prevailing notion that the CeA is a passive gateway conveying information from the BLA to downstream fear effectors, mounting evidence illustrates that this structure is an active participant not only in fear conditioning but also in distinct behavioral phenotypes. --></p>
<p>Neurons within this nucleus are<!--constitute--> a diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and <em>in vivo</em> patterns of activity.<!-- figure /// with different functional and molecular features. //  -->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Sun &amp; Cassell, 1993)</span>, further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA <span class="citation">(Medina <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Waclaw <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (e.i., a small soma and numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low density of dendritic spines (<span class="citation">Cassell &amp; Gray (1989)</span>; <span class="citation">McDonald (1982b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalastr">2.1</a>).
Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections <span class="citation">(Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive firing spikes <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004)</span>.
Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.<!-- CeL or CeA in general? -->
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells <span class="citation">(Martina <em>et al.</em>, 1999)</span>. <!-- figure-->
The latter are characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency (&gt;40 Hz) with no accommodation <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>, as their counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA.
Moreover, their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with &gt; 1 ms in other cell types in CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>. <!-- citations? -->
The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed with T-type calcium channels, which are thought to contribute to characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to depolarizing current pulses as well as rebound spikes when hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including SOM, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin (ENK), and others <span class="citation">(Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>PKCδ-expressing neurons, which are mainly localized in the CeL and CeC subdivision of the CeA, form a relatively homogeneous group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (∼85%; <span class="citation">Haubensak <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>).
The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons <span class="citation">(Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Functionally, following fear-conditioning, these neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> and thus are often referred to as CeL<sub>OFF</sub> cells <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, almost half of the PKCδ neurons co-express ENK or OR, which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM <span class="citation">(Huber <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Viviani <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKCδ marker express SOM <span class="citation">(Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Those cells display heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining 40% are classified as LF <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Moreover, during fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear memory <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Importantly, sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Therefore, they have often been termed CeL<sub>ON</sub> neurons.
Many findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF <span class="citation">(Pomrenze <em>et al.</em>, 2015; McCullough <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
Accordingly, as PKCδ and CRF- or SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional roles.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the conjunction of optogenetics and electrophysiological approaches not only has further supported the prevailing notion that CeL neurons send mainly unidirectional afferents to CeM (<span class="citation">Haubensak <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Jolkkonen &amp; Pitkänen (1998)</span>; <span class="citation">Li <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>; <span class="citation">Petrovich &amp; Swanson (1997)</span>, Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b and c) but also has illustrated the complexity and extent of CeL intraconnectivity (i.e., within the network) and interconnectivity (i.e., between networks).
Generally, the CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features <span class="citation">(Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Martina <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004; Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes (Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c). <!-- zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. -->
For example, synapses formed between LF→RS and RS→LF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class <span class="citation">(Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal activity of the CeL is required for the fear acquisition, whereas activity in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, CeM activation alone is well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing <span class="citation">(LeDoux <em>et al.</em>, 1988)</span>.
This effect can be mimicked by CeL inactivation, indicating that CeL neurons tonically inhibit CeM output <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Gozzi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PKCδ-expressing cells than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable projections to the CeM <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
In contrast, the PKC-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons (<span class="citation">Haubensak <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Li <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>, Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part c).
Hence, during the presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically inhibited by CeL<sub>ON</sub>, SOM-immunopositive neurons <span class="citation">(Gozzi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>, leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction of freezing.<!-- dobrze wytłumaczone w Penzo 2014  -->
However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced, PKCδ-expressing CeL projection neurons become active, inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output. <!-- Therefore, the balance between activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations results in two  /// Therefore, these two parallel CeA outputs have been shown to control behavioral output balanced between passive freezing (*via* CeM output to the brainstem) and active exploration (*via* CeL-mediated disinhibition of cortical neurons). -->
Therefore, the balance between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly impacts the behavioral output of this region.</p>
<p>Accumulating studies have illustrated that CeA projects to different brainstem sites.
Briefly, both CeM and CeL neurons, especially those expressing CRF, send substantial projections to the BNST and locus coeruleus (LC), affecting fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing (<span class="citation">Asok <em>et al.</em> (2018)</span>, <span class="citation">Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov (2018)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b).
In addition, CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) are implicated in autonomic regulation <span class="citation">(Viviani <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, whereas projection to PAG and PVT are thought to mediate defensive behaviour <span class="citation">(Viviani <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Penzo <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Furthermore, CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC, which stimulation was shown to modulate reward-related behaviors (<span class="citation">Seo <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>, see Fig. <a href="cxcl12.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">2.2</a>, part b).
Additionally, CRF-expressing neurons were shown to project to the SN, the VTA, and the LH <span class="citation">(Tsumori <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Reyes <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Pomrenze <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, regions mediating brain reward function.</p>
<p>In addition to its well-known role in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the pain pathway.
Interestingly, activation of ENK-containing neurons in CeL and CeC resulted in an increased c-Fos expression in PAG and reduced anxiety-like behavior and analgesia in both uninjured mice and mice with neuropathic pain <span class="citation">(Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019)</span>.
This evidence strongly suggests the role of ENK-expressing neurons in regulating both nociception and emotion.</p>
<p>Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enable to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- bardziej zmienić -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and origin. <!-- bardziej zmienić // ładne podsumowanie--></p>

All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and homeostatic control.

Thus, the amygdala functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant sensory information about the external and internal environment into behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in homeostasis.
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution <span class="citation">(Jarvis <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>, better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.</p>

<!-- Abnormal functioning of the amygdala is observed in various psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD,  specific  phobias,  depression,  autism  spectrum  disorder and  antisocial  personality  disorder  (Baron-Cohen  et  al.,  2000; Ferri et al., 2017; Fonzo and Etkin, 2017; Garcia, 2017; Kolla et al., 2017; Henigsberg et al., 2019).-->
<!-- As described above, computations performed by BLA circuits to control emotional responses are heavily influenced by a myriad of inputs conveying both sensory and cognitive information.
The subsequent generation of emotional responses by the  BLA  is largely determined by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to  BLA principal cells which are tightly controlled by GABAergic interneurons [@bocchio_2016; @capogna_2014; @hjos_2021; @spampanato_2011].
Thus, here, I briefly discuss our current understanding of the connectivity of this complex neuronal network. //
Thus, we are beginning to unravel how a single brain region can encode such opposite behaviors, which is of high relevance and warrants further investigation.-->
