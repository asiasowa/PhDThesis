# Abstract

Chemokines are emerging as key players in a broad array of biological
responses in the brain under physiological, non-inflammatory conditions.
They can be found in all brain cells - from brain-blood barrier
endothelium, through all types of glia, to neurons and neural stem
cells. Neuron-glia crosstalk is also suggested to be modulated by
chemokines. It should be noted that glial cells not only express
chemokine receptors but also can dynamically release them, thus
influencing the activity of neurons or other brain cells. This
orchestration of neuron-glia communication is believed to be essential
in maintaining brain homeostasis. Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 have
attracted much attention by demonstrating their role in such phenomena
as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, as well as modulation of synaptic
transmission and
plasticity.<!-- this PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CR1 and CXCR4, as they are widely distributed in the CNS under non-inflammatory, physiological conditions and involved in an increasing array of functions, such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavior//// Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are particularly important in this regard, as they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they act on cellular, synaptic, network, and behavioral levels. // Two of them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, have particularly received much attention due to their constitutive and widely distributed expression in the CNS, along with their well-documented impact on neurodevelopment, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and behavior.-->
The relatively high expression of their receptors, i.e., CX3CR1 and
CXCR4, in limbic brain structures supports the association between them
and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety or depression.
Consistently, the impairment of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and/or CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling led to behavioral of neurobiological consequences, such as
impaired learning or anxiety. Despite this, mechanisms of chemokines in
the regions involved in anxiety (such as the amygdala) remain largely
unknown. It would provide critical insight into the physiological
mechanisms underlying neuroimmunological interactions in the amygdala.

The aim of this study was to dissect the underlying mechanisms and
effects of activation of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 receptors on synaptic
transmission and electrophysiological property of neurons in two nuclei
of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) - the main input nucleus, and
central (CeA) - the main output nucleus.

To this end, by using a combination of electrophysiological and
pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and
CXCL12) on neuronal properties as well as synaptic transmission were
determined. Moreover, the involvement of microglia or astrocytes was
measured by using minocycline or fluorocitrate,
respectively.<!-- mechanisms of chemokine-regulated neuron–glia communication in the context of synaptic transmission.-->
In order to confirm the neuronal expression of CX3CR1,
immunohistochemical staining was used.

In the BLA, CX3CL1 increased the threshold for spike generation,
reducing the neuronal excitability of principal cells (PCs). This effect
was accompanied by the impaired LTP at cortico-BLA synapses and
attenuated GABAergic transmission manifested as a decreased frequency of
spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs). These effects were
blocked in the presence of the CX3CR1 antagonists, AZD8797. The
treatment of the inhibitor of microglial activity, minocycline,
eliminated the CX3CL1-triggered effects. These results suggest that the
CX3CR1 activation might modulate the memory and emotional processing
*via* its involvement in the GABAergic transmission and the attenuation
of the PCs firing and synaptic plasticity.

In the CeA, CX3CL1 decreased the input resistance of Regular-Spiking
neurons (RS), resulting in the attenuation of their spiking. The firing
reduction of RS neurons consequently reduced the frequency of sIPSCs in
Late-Firing cells (LF). Those effects were eliminated in the presence of
the antagonist of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797, or minocycline, the
inhibitor of microglial activity. Thus, the network activity in the CeA
is suggested to be, at least in part, modulated by the CX3CR1
activation.

The treatment of CXCL12 in the BLA triggered a nonsignificant increase
in the PCs excitability and dual changes in the inhibitory synaptic
transmission.<!-- Regarding CXCL12, despite a trend towards the increase in the excitability and complex modulation of GABAergic transmission, this chemokine did not exert any statistically significant effects in the BLA.-->
These changes are in line with the CXCL12-induced increase in
glutamatergic transmission observed by other group.

CXCL12 enhanced firing in both types of CeA neurons. The application of
this chemokine facilitated the sEPSCs frequency preferentially onto
Regular-Spiking neurons. Those effects were eliminated in the presence
of the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. The CXCR4 activation triggered an
increased frequency of sIPSCs onto Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the
amplitude of these events in Late-Firing neurons was reduced. Those
effects were blocked in the presence of a CXCR4 receptor antagonist and
by inhibition of astrocytic activity by fluorocitrate.

Altogether, findings from this study highlight the neuromodulatory role
of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 in both nuclei of the amygdala, which is a
consequence of their regulation of local neuron-glial communication.
Further investigation in this area will lead to a better understanding
of neuroimmunological mechanisms in the amygdala and provide novel
insights into neuro-immune mechanisms in the amygdala and yield new
targets for developing treatments of amygdala-related disorders.

# Streszczenie

Coraz więcej badań wskazuje na rolę chemokin w szeregu biologicznych
odpowiedzi w warunkach fizjologicznych. Obecność chemokin wykazano we
wszystkich komórkach mózgowych - od komórek śródbłonka bariery
krew-mózg, przez wszystkie typy komórek glejowych, po neurony i nerwowe
komórki macierzyste. Sugeruje się także, że komunikacja pomiędzy
neuronami a komórkami glejowymi jest również modulowana przez chemokiny.
Należy podkreślić, że komórki glejowe nie tylko wykazują obecność
receptorów chemokinowych ale także potrafią w sposób dynamiczny uwalniać
poszczególne typy chemokin, tym samym wpływając na aktywność neuronów
lub innych komórek w mózgu. Przypuszcza się, że te interakcje są jednym
z kluczowych czynników odpowiedzialnych za utrzymanie w szerokim
rozumieniu homeostazy OUN. Dwie z chemokin, CX3CL1 i CXCL12, wzbudziły
zainteresowanie przez ich szczególnie istotną rolę w modulacji
neurogenezy, neuroprotekcji, a także modulacji transmisji synaptycznej
oraz
plastyczności.<!-- Przypuszcza się, że chemokiny mogą oddziaływać na przekaźnictwo między komórkami nerwowymi oraz procesy plastyczności synaptycznej.// Uważa się, że szczególnie dwie z nich, chemokina CX3CL1 i CXCL12 pełnią szczególnie istotną rolę w koordynacji ww. komunikacji. -->
Szczególnie wysoka ekspresja receptorów dla tych dwóch chemokin, tj.
CX3CR1 i CXCR4, w obszarach limbicznych sugeruje związek pomiędzy nimi a
chorobami psychicznymi, takimi jak lęk czy depresja. Potwierdzają to
badania w których wykazano, że zablokowanie sygnalizacji CX3CL1/CX3CR1
i/lub CXCL12/CXCR4 prowadzi w testach behawioralnych na zwierzętach do
upośledzenie uczenia się oraz nasilenia reakcji lekowych. Mimo to
mechanizm działania chemokin w obszarach mózgu związanymi z zaburzeniami
lękowymi (ciało migdałowate) pozostaje w zasadzie niezbadany. Określenie
wpływu chemokin na regulację aktywności struktur ciała migdałowatego
wniosłoby znaczący wkład w dalsze zrozumienie powiązania pomiędzy
układem nerwowym a odpornościowym.

Celem przeprowadzonych badań, było określenie mechanizmów i efektów
aktywacji receptorów CX3CR1 i CXCR4 na przekaźnictwo nerwowe oraz
właściwości elektrofizjologiczne neuronów w dwóch jądrach ciała
migdałowatego - w podstawnobocznym (BLA) - głównym wejściu oraz
środkowym (CeA) - głównym wyjściu z obszaru kompleksu jąder
migdałowatych.

Dzięki połączeniu elektrofizjologicznych i farmakologicznych metod, te
efekty zostały zbadane. Co więcej, wpływ mikrogleju i astrocytów był
zmierzony przez użycie minocykliny lub fluorocytrynianu. W celu
określenia neuronalnej lokalizacji receptora CX3CR1 wykonano także
barwienia immunohistochemiczne.

W BLA, podanie chemokiny CX3CL1 zwiększyło prąd progowy, prowadząc tym
samym do zmniejszonej pobudliwości neuronów głównych (ang. *principal
cells*, PCs). Temu efektowi towarzyszyła osłabiona plastyczność
synaptyczna w synapsach korowo-podstawnobocznych oraz zmniejszona
częstotliwość spontanicznych hamujących prądów postsynaptycznych
(sIPSCs). Efekty te blokowane były w obecności antagonisty receptora
CX3CR1, AZD8797. Również zastosowanie inhibitora aktywności mikrogleju,
minocykliny, blokowało efekty podania chemokiny CX3CL1. Uzyskane wyniki
mogą sugerować, że aktywacja receptorów CX3CR1 poprzez wpływ na
przekaźnictwo GABArgiczne oraz osłabienie pobudliwości komórek
podstawowych i procesów plastyczności synaptyczej może modulować pamięć
i reakcję emocjonalną.

W CeA, CX3CL1 zmniejszała oporność błony komórkowej neuronów regularnie
wyładowujących się (ang. *Regular-Spiking neurons*; RS), co skutkowało
spadkiem ich pobudliwości. Spadek aktywności tych neuronów spowodował
zmniejszenie sIPSCs rejestrowanych w neuronach o późnym początku
wyładowania (ang. *Late-Firing neurons*; LF). Efekty te były blokowane w
obecności w obecności antagonisty receptorów CX3CR1 AZD8797 lub po
zahamowaniu aktywności komórek mikroglejowych minocykliną. Sugeruje to,
że aktywność sieciowa CeA jest przynajmniej w części modulowana przez
aktywację receptorów CX3CR1.

Podanie chemokiny CXCL12 w BLA wywoływało nieznaczny wzrost pobudliwości
PCs oraz dwukierunkowe zmiany w hamującej transmisji synaptycznej,
chociaż oba te efekty nie uzyskały istotności statystycznej. Kierunek
zarejestrowanych efektów aktywacji receptora CXCR4 jest zgodny wynikami
uzyskanymi przez inną grupę badawczą, która wykazała wzrost
przekaźnictwa pobudzającego w BLA po podaniu CXCL12.

Podanie CXCL12 zwiększyło pobudliwość zarówno neuronów RS jak i LF w
CeA. Podanie tej chemokiny nasilało również częstotliwość spontanicznych
pobudzających prądów synaptycznych rejestrowanych z neuronów RS. Efekty
te blokowane były przez antagonistę receptora CXCR4, AMD3100. Aktywacja
receptorów CXCR4 zwiększała także częstotliwość sIPSCs rejestrowanych z
neuronów RS. Natomiast rejestracja z neuronów LF wykazała hamujące
działanie CXCL12 na amplitudę prądów GABAergicznych. Efekty te były
blokowane przez antagonistę receptora CXCR4, jak i przez zablokowanie
aktywności astrocytów podaniem fluorocytrynianu. Podsumowując, uzyskane
wyniki sugerują neuromodulacyjną rolę chemokin w obu badanych jądrach
obszaru ciała migdałowatego, co wynika z ich regulacji komunikacji
pomiędzy neuronami a komórkami glejowymi. Dalsze badania w tym zakresie
mogą prowadzić do lepszego zrozumienia mechanizmów neuroimmunologicznych
w ciele migdałowatym i dostarczyć nowych kandydatów dla rozwoju leczenia
zaburzeń związanych z funkcjami tej struktury.

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Chemokines

### 1.1.1 Brief history of chemokines

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa)
secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. They
were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and
central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in
late 1980 (Yoshimura *et al.*, 1987). However, a decade later, the first
reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their
receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) (Meucci *et al.*, 1998).
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express
chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological
relevance of chemokines in the CNS? The explanation is that they control
neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and
activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting
cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (Williams *et al.*,
2014). However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to
pathological conditions. It is now clear that all types of brain cells
synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine
stimulation *via* their cognate receptor expression, also under
physiological conditions, suggesting their brain-specific functions.
Indeed, mounting evidence illustrates that chemokine can act on cellular
(e.g., inducing neuroprotective signaling pathways), synaptic (e.g.,
modulating synaptic transmission), network (e.g., regulating synaptic
potentiation), and behavioral levels (e.g., impairing memory; for a
comprehensive review: Sowa & Tokarski (2021)). Moreover, the complex
cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to
intricate cell-to-cell communications. Thus, of particular interest is
now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of
neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which
is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis (Trettel *et al.*, 2020).

This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and
CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CR1 and CXCR4,
as they are widely distributed in the CNS under non-inflammatory,
physiological conditions and involved in an increasing array of
functions, such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission,
synaptic plasticity and behavior (Réaux-Le Goazigo *et al.*, 2013;
Trettel *et al.*, 2020; Sowa & Tokarski, 2021).

### 1.1.2 Classification, structure, and signaling of the chemokine system

Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with
20 to 90% homology in their sequences. Their molecular weight varies
from 8 to 14 kDa. To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine
receptors have been cloned or characterized (Hughes & Nibbs, 2018). All
chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible
N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded
antiparallel β-sheet on which a C-terminal α-helix is folded (for
review: Miller & Mayo (2017)). Although N-terminus is widely
acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in
this regard. Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and
chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and
signal transduction, including N-loop, or highly conserved GP
(glycine-proline) motif (for review: Kleist *et al.* (2016)). Thus,
these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or
chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor
activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for
chemokine-receptor pairs.

Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the
cell type that produced them. However, a systematic nomenclature was
introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine
residues closest to the N‐terminus. It consists of the subfamily
designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting
“ligand”), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated
(Zlotnik & Yoshie (2000), see Figure <a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues
in the CXC subclass (also known as α, see Figure
<a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>, part a). Chemokines containing the first
two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC
subclass (also known as β, see Fig. <a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>, part
b). C chemokines (also known as γ, see Figure
<a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>, part c) are characterized by the presence
of only two cysteine residues. The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine
subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called
fractalkine). It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids
between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and
mucin-like domain (see Figure <a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>, part d).

Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine
receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional
chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs).
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by
several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and
C-terminal intracellular domains. The N-terminal extracellular domain is
considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation,
while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for
receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. Based on the subfamily of
chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle
as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R,” which denotes “receptor”
(see: Figure <a href="#fig:family">1.1</a>). Most of these receptors
belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively,
while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR (Hughes & Nibbs, 2018).

Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein
pathways and couple either to the G<sub>αi</sub> subunit following
inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels or G<sub>αq</sub> that
activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol
and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein
kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic
Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. However, mounting evidence describes the
involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including
distinct G protein subtypes (G<sub>11</sub> or G<sub>α12/13</sub>), or
alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)½, Janus kinases
(JAKs), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (for reviews: Allen *et al.*
(2007), Rostène, Guyon, *et al.* (2011)).

ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives
(Bachelerie *et al.*, 2014; Salvi *et al.*, 2017), structurally resemble
conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for
chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx
chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)). They bind a wide variety of chemokine
ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly
through β-arrestins (Hughes & Nibbs, 2018). Due to their inability to
activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce
chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine
ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or
chemokine gradient formation (Nibbs & Graham, 2013; Bachelerie *et al.*,
2014; Bonecchi & Graham, 2016). However, recent data cast a new light on
the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine
networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and
pathological contexts (for review: Salvi *et al.* (2017)). Regarding the
CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.

#### 1.1.2.1 Chemokine system expression and signaling

As chemokines constitute one of the most tightly regulated systems,
their signaling is modulated *via* a broad array of factors, which we
are now beginning to appreciate (see for reviews: Eiger *et al.* (2021);
Hughes & Nibbs (2018); Zweemer *et al.* (2014)). Figure
<a href="#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a> illustrates most of these
mechanisms, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.
These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications,
dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors,
dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface,
and biased signaling.

Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be
controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical
modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination
or cleavage by several proteases (Hughes & Nibbs (2018), see: Fig.
<a href="#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part a). These changes profoundly
affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine
activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even
switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist (Hughes & Nibbs,
2018).

Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich
repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: Zlotnik &
Yoshie (2000), Hughes & Nibbs (2018), Fig.
<a href="#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part b). It is widely accepted
that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas
nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands. However, it
becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines
and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than
previously thought, as further addressed in this section. Consequently,
each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the
simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules (Zweemer
*et al.*, 2014).

Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers
(heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding
properties or activating different signaling pathways (Salanga & Handel,
2011). Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g.,
with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic
activity of various chemokine pairs (Kleist *et al.*, 2016). Moreover,
increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other
factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within
extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and
accumulate them. It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as
it regulates their local concentration and availability for their
receptors. Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific
expression (Lortat-Jacob, 2009), along with their selective binding of
certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet
another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of
cell-to-cell communication.

Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another
feature specific for GPCR receptors (Zweemer *et al.* (2014), Kleist *et
al.* (2016), see: Fig <a href="#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part d).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished. Ligand bias occurs
when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could
preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either
G-protein or β-arrestin, and their downstream elements, according to
cell-specific differences. Another type of bias signaling, receptor
bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple
chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor
pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular
responses in different spatial contexts. This type of bias is a
consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and
transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction
cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and β-arrestins), to
all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK½ or MAPK)
in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.
Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation
highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal
context.

In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial
functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to
list a few. A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental
cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among
others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated
mechanisms enabling quick response to the dynamic microenvironment with
possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.

The two members of the chemokine family, i.e., CX3CL1 and CXCL12, have
attracted much researchers’ attention due to their wide distribution in
the CNS under physiological conditions and involvement in an increasing
array of functions. In addition to their broad expression in the
periphery, which is beyond the scope of this dissertation, chemokines
and CKRs are also expressed by healthy neurons, microglia, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells (for a comprehensive review,
see: Sowa & Tokarski (2021)).

#### 1.1.2.2 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair structure, expression, and signaling

CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine
on many levels. First of all, to date, it is the only known member of
the CX3C chemokine δ family (Pan *et al.*, 1997). In humans, the full
length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino
acids (Bazan *et al.*, 1997; Pan *et al.*, 1997). Thus, it is also
larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around
70–80 amino acids (Zlotnik & Yoshie, 2012). CX3CL1 is comprised of an
extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid
glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and
a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Like CXCL16, fractalkine is
present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to
cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a
shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its
N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) *via* the action of
several proteases (Bajetto *et al.* (2001); Schulte *et al.* (2007), see
Section <a href="#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>). These enzymes are
metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17, or cysteine protease
Cathepsin S (CatS), acting both in the periphery and the CNS (Garton *et
al.*, 2001; Hundhausen *et al.*, 2003; Clark *et al.*, 2007; Cook *et
al.*, 2010; Jones *et al.*, 2013). While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a
conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of
CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions
are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte
capture and infiltration (Ransohoff, 2009). Some important molecular
pathways implicated in CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are summarized on Fig.
<a href="#fig:cx3cr1signal">1.3</a>.

Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a
G<sub>i</sub>-protein-coupled receptor (Imai *et al.*, 1997). The
subunit G<sub>i</sub> inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a
variety of intracellular second messengers, including phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NFκB) (Al-Aoukaty *et al.*, 1998;
Chandrasekar *et al.*, 2003). These molecules are known to regulate a
wide range of cellular functions, including apoptosis, proliferation,

In the brain, CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, are widely distributed in
the CNS, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus
pallidus, striatum, and thalamus (Harrison *et al.*, 1998; Tarozzo *et
al.*, 2003). Besides the well-documented neuronal expression of CX3CL1,
a handful of studies also revealed its presence in astrocytes, albeit at
lower levels (for instance: Sunnemark *et al.* (2005)). However, the
expression pattern of CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, in the CNS, remains
controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia
(Tarozzo *et al.*, 2003; Cardona *et al.*, 2006), whereas several lines
of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence
documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in
hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and dorsal raphe nucleus
(DRN) neurons (Meucci *et al.*, 1998, 2000; Maciejewski-Lenoir *et al.*,
1999; Hatori *et al.*, 2002; Hughes *et al.*, 2002; Tarozzo *et al.*,
2003; Verge *et al.*, 2004; Limatola *et al.*, 2005; Zhuang *et al.*,
2007; Heinisch & Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya *et al.*, 2012, 2014). Thus,
although predominantly expressed by microglia, CX3CR1 is also documented
to be present on neuronal membranes, at least in pathological
conditions.

#### 1.1.2.3 CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 trio structure, expression, and signaling

On the other hand, CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor
1α, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily. In humans,
CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms
(α, β, γ, δ, ε, φ), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa (Yu *et al.*,
2006). The α product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most
abundant one (Yu *et al.*, 2006). Hence, as used here, the term “CXCL12”
refers to the α isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD
dissertation. It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling
peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature
protein. However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in
physiologic and pathological processes (for a review: Britton *et al.*
(2021)). CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded β-sheet held in close
apposition to an α-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation
(Murphy *et al.*, 2007; Wu *et al.*, 2010). CXCL12 signal through its
canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known
as CXCR7. All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate
species (Nomiyama *et al.*, 2013; Nomiyama & Yoshie, 2015).
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly
ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 (Balabanian *et
al.*, 2005).

CXCL12, along with their receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, is constitutively
expressed and widely distributed in the CNS, both during
neurodevelopment and adulthood (Banisadr *et al.*, 2002; Stumm *et al.*,
2002, 2003; Schönemeier *et al.*, 2008). Moreover, these molecules are
present in nearly all CNS cell types, including endothelial, glial, and
notably neuronal cells. Specifically, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are
co-localized with many neuropeptides, for example, in dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area
(VTA)(Guyon *et al.*, 2006). Furthermore, ACKR3 and CXCR4 are
co-expressed in the same neuronal (Shimizu *et al.*, 2011) and
astrocytic populations (Odemis *et al.*, 2010). In neurons, prominent
cytoplasmic expression of ACKR3 was demonstrated, whereas CXCR4 was
found on the cell membrane (Shimizu *et al.*, 2011), suggesting that
ACKR3 may affect CXCR4 trafficking and/or coupling to other proteins
(Shimizu *et al.*, 2011). Consistently, ACKR3 up-regulation was shown to
enhance heterodimer formation with CXCR4, which further resulted in its
internalization and degeneration (Uto-Konomi *et al.*, 2013). Moreover,
as described in detail in Section Biased signaling (see Section:
<a href="#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>), there is a possibility that
CXCL12 might trigger different ACKR3- or CXCR4- signaling in certain
cellular contexts, which could lead to either G protein-dependent or
-independent biased response.

Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, in addition to the enhancement of
receptor-ligand binding, there is a subsequent GDP exchange for GTP, and
the trimeric G<sub>i</sub>-protein dissociates into its constituent
parts, G<sub>αi</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> (Ganju *et al.* (1998); see
Fig. <a href="#fig:cxcl12sig">1.4</a>). These molecules activate several
intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review:
Britton *et al.* (2021), Ward (2006)). PLC hydrolyses phospholipid
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG)
and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 production leads to
increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while
DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Both intracellular free calcium
and PKC promote the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and proliferation.
In parallel, the α<sub>i</sub> subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase and a
consequent cAMP production and activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway,
resulting in cell cycle entry and proliferation (Cheng *et al.*, 2015).
In addition to the well-characterized coupling to G<sub>αi</sub>,
convincing evidence illustrates that CXCR4 can also bind to other
G<sub>α</sub> proteins such as G<sub>αq</sub>, G<sub>αo</sub>, and
G<sub>αs</sub> (for a comprehensive review: Pozzobon *et al.* (2016);
see Fig. <a href="#fig:cxcl12sig">1.4</a>). For example, by binding to
G<sub>α12/13</sub>, CXCR4 leads to Rho activation, whereas
G<sub>αq</sub> signal through Rac activation. Moreover, it is well
documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal
pathway. Following CXCR4 activation, G-protein coupled receptor kinases
(GRKs) are also activated, inducing the intracellular C-terminal domain
phosphorylation, which, in turn, results in β-arrestins recruitment.
These molecules lead to the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and
subsequent receptor internalization. Moreover, β-arrestins were reported
to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CXCR4, leading to receptor
downregulation and trafficking to endosomal compartments (DeNies *et
al.*, 2019).

CXCL12 second receptor, ACKR3, like other ACKR receptors, contains a
modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a
highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs (Thelen &
Thelen, 2008). The modification of this motif is believed to disable the
activation of G proteins and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced
chemotaxis (Burns *et al.*, 2006; Levoye *et al.*, 2009; Rajagopal *et
al.*, 2010). Thus, for a long time, as a member of the atypical
chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 was thought to share some peculiar
characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein
signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease
in the extracellular chemokine concentration (Naumann *et al.*, 2010).
However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor,
ACKR3 could also signal *via* the β-arrestin pathway (Rajagopal *et
al.*, 2010; Wang *et al.*, 2011). Moreover, although the same ligand
activates CXCR4 and ACKR3, they signal through different pathways
(β-arrestin vs. G-coupled). Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a
β-arrestin biased receptor (see Section
<a href="#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>). Nonetheless, more recently, it
was shown that ACKR3 has functionality independent of the β-arrestins.
Specifically, Montpas *et al.* (2018) demonstrated that both small
interfering RNA knockdown of β-arrestin1 and or β-arrestin2 in HEK293
cells do not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of ACKR3’s
ligands (i.e., CXCL11 and CXCL12). In addition, the following studies
further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12
results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels
following the activation of Pertussis Toxin-sensitive G<sub>i/o</sub>
proteins, leading to proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes
(Odemis *et al.*, 2010). Although these events were previously reported
to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: Bajetto *et al.* (2001)), a recent
report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these
CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or
depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted
or blocked ACKR3 receptor (Odemis *et al.*, 2012). These findings
suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in
those cells. Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased
receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist (Burns *et
al.*, 2006), resulted in activation of β-arrestin2 signaling in the same
experimental setting (Odemis *et al.*, 2012). Therefore, it is
speculated that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an
atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a
classical, G protein-activating GPCR. However, due to contradictory
results from previous studies, this issue warrants further
clarification.

Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12
treatment, ACKR3 impairs astrocytic gap-junctional communication by
inducing a Connexin-43 (Cx43) internalization in a β-arrestin2-dependent
manner (Fumagalli *et al.*, 2020). In contrast, CXCR4 leads to NF-κβ
activation with consequent Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) and
glutamate release from these cells (Bezzi *et al.*, 2001; Calì *et al.*,
2008; Calì & Bezzi, 2010). Therefore, these data suggest that CXCR4 and
ACKR3 may serve distinct functions *via* different signaling pathways in
astrocytes, indicating that, in particular cellular contexts, ACKR3
might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling (Heuninck
*et al.*, 2019).

### 1.1.3 Chemokines actions in the CNS

Over the past two decades, mounting evidence has illustrated that
chemokines are also essential players in the CNS during neurodevelopment
and in the adult brain beyond their well-known immunological role.
Accordingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and
their corresponding receptors, including the described above
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes, overlap in many regions in
the healthy CNS, suggesting their involvement in local communication,
especially crosstalk between neurons and glia.

Recently, in the light of the “glial revolution,” our long-held views of
the functions of these cells have been completely challenged.
Astrocytes, previously considered supporting and nourishing neurons, are
now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex
brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity,
network oscillations, and behavior (Perea *et al.*, 2009; Mederos &
Perea, 2019). Being organized into microdomains and coupled into
multicellular astrocytic networks *via* gap junctions, they are highly
specialized cells (for a review: Khakh & Sofroniew (2015)). Furthermore,
astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites, and
synapses. For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte
makes contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to
2,000,000 synapses in humans (Oberheim *et al.*, 2009), suggesting
bidirectional communication. Indeed, they are endowed with a great
variety of ion channels and receptors (Olsen *et al.*, 2015; Seifert *et
al.*, 2018; Kofuji & Araque, 2021) to react to a changing
microenvironment, while they can release a substantial set of
gliotransmitters (Araque *et al.*, 2014; Covelo & Araque, 2018;
Savtchouk & Volterra, 2018). Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are particularly
relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>
levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic
transmission. Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations
are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been
extensively discussed in several excellent reviews (Araque *et al.*,
2014; Bazargani & Attwell, 2016; Guerra-Gomes *et al.*, 2017).

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about
5–12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord
(Szepesi *et al.*, 2018). They are derived from the myeloid precursor
cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development
(for a review, see: Prinz & Mildner (2011)). These glial cells are also
broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and
functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a
review, see: Szepesi *et al.* (2018)). Although microglia have long been
recognized as “guardians of the brain,” regulating inflammatory
responses in the CNS, it is becoming increasingly evident that their
functions are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain
during both development and adulthood. Being equipped by highly motile
processes, microglia are dynamic and plastic cells that constantly
monitor the microenvironment to sense local perturbation. Moreover,
similar to astrocytes, microglia also express numerous cell surface ion
channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, as well
as signaling molecules.

Hence, both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamic and
heterogeneous cells. Notably, those rich repertoires of expressed
surface and signaling molecules include a set of chemokines and their
receptors. Thus, glial cells can both react to and release chemokines
(for example: Dorf *et al.* (2000), McKimmie & Graham (2010); Sowa *et
al.* (2017)). Given constant glial monitoring of brain parenchyma, these
immune molecules might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the
influence of the environment to brain function, from cellular to
synaptic, network, and finally behavioral levels.

The first discoveries regarding CX3CL1 and CXCL12 non-inflammatory roles
were studies showing their influence on the reduction of neurotoxicity,
mainly by activating neuroprotective pathways, such as Akt
phosphorylation or activation of MAP kinases (p-38, ERK½)
(Maciejewski-Lenoir *et al.*, 1999; Meucci *et al.*, 2000).
Specifically, CXCL12 (Meucci *et al.*, 1998) and then CX3CL1 (Meucci *et
al.*, 2000) were reported to reduce the apoptotic death of hippocampal
neurons induced by gp120 or glia deprivation. Later, more studies
further documented that both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are neuroprotective
against glutamate-induced and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal
cultures from either rodents or humans (Deiva *et al.*, 2004; Limatola
*et al.*, 2005; Nicolai *et al.*, 2010).

Moreover, the binding of CX3CL1 to microglial CX3CR1 was shown to
restrain LPS-induced microglia activation (Mizuno *et al.* (2003);
Zujovic *et al.* (2000), for a review: Biber *et al.* (2007)), leading
to the initial presumption that CX3CL1 maintains microglia in a
‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state. However, further studies illustrated that
microglia activation is not an all or none event, but rather a continuum
of progressive stages depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory cues in the local environment, which, in turn,
change their phenotype and functional activity (Crain *et al.* (2013);
Lively & Schlichter (2013); for a review: Masuda *et al.* (2020) and Tan
*et al.* (2020)).

Nevertheless, following the CX3CL1 application, microglia was reported
to release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection, including
adenosine (Lauro *et al.*, 2008, 2010). It is an endogenous modulator of
brain functions, binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes
(adenosine A1 receptor, adenosine A2A receptor, adenosine A<sub>2C</sub>
receptor, and adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor - A<sub>1</sub>R,
A<sub>2A</sub>R, A<sub>2C</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub>R, respectively). It
was shown that adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection *via*
A<sub>1</sub>R (Lauro *et al.*, 2008, 2010). This receptor, expressed on
microglia, was also reported to be required for CX3CL1 increase in
glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) activity in astrocytes, resulting in
higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and thereby
neuroprotective action (Catalano *et al.*, 2013). Thus, these data
nicely illustrate the CX3CL1-regulated local communication between
microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to neuroprotection.

The next milestone in neuroimmunology was observations that CX3CL1 and
CXCL12 with their corresponding receptors exhibit the highest expression
during neurodevelopment, indicating their crucial functions during this
period. Indeed, it has become increasingly evident that both
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes are crucial players in
regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival in this period.
For instance, during hippocampal development, CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup>
deficient microglia showed impaired migration (Paolicelli *et al.*,
2011; Pagani *et al.*, 2015). This observation was associated with their
delayed synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient reduction of synaptic
density and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons compared to
their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties
(Paolicelli *et al.*, 2011). Precisely, these changes were observed
during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline.
Importantly, these mice were also tested in similar experimental
settings in their adulthood (P40) (Zhan *et al.*, 2014). Although
dendritic spine density remained unchanged, neurons from
CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> mice still displayed a lower frequency of miniature
and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and sEPSCs,
respectively) than their wild-type littermates, illustrating that a
transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is
sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic transmission
despite unchanged the number of excitatory synapses (Zhan *et al.*,
2014).

On the other hand, those neurodevelopmental processes regulated by
CX3CL1 and CXCL12 (i.e., proliferation, migration, and survival) are
also present in the adult brain. Accordingly, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are
associated not only with developmental neurogenesis (Tran *et al.*,
2004; Pujol *et al.*, 2005; Lysko *et al.*, 2011), but also adult
neurogenesis, which is restricted to two neurogenic regions, i.e., the
subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the
subgranular zone (SGZ) near the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus.
For example, both CXCR4 and CX3CR1 receptors are expressed on neural
stem cells (Ji *et al.*, 2004). In addition, it is well established that
CXCL12 is responsible for the generation and positioning of new neurons
within these niches, as well as their axonal and dendritic outgrowth and
branching (Abe *et al.*, 2015, 2018; Zhu *et al.*, 2017). Moreover,
similar to what was observed during the neurodevelopment, in
CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice, adult-born granule neurons in the DG
also displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with additionally
observed morphological changes, such as enlargement and shortening
(Bolós *et al.*, 2018). Besides being ultrastructurally enlarged,
synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic
vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality.

Given their previously mentioned inhibition of both glutamate and
N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated neurotoxicity, together with their
influence on neuronal processes outgrowth, branching, and synaptic
pruning, one could speculate that CXCL12 and CX3CL1 could modulate
electrophysiological properties in the CNS. Indeed, accumulating data
reveals that these chemokines modulate neuronal electrical activity
through both postsynaptic (e.g., changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients
or intrinsic membrane properties by activation/inactivation of
particular channels/receptors following CKRs activation) and presynaptic
(i.e., including presence in synaptic vesicle and (co-)release of
neuropeptides/neurotransmitters/gliotransmitters) mechanisms (for a
review: Rostène *et al.* (2007) and Sowa & Tokarski (2021)). For
example, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce
spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents
(Meucci *et al.*, 1998; Limatola *et al.*, 2005; Ragozzino *et al.*,
2006; Lauro *et al.*, 2008). Importantly, further investigations
revealed that CX3CL1 might not exclusively act on postsynaptic neurons
but also activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine
(Piccinin *et al.*, 2010). Similarly, one of the adenosinergic
receptors, the A<sub>2A</sub>R, together with D-serine release from
glial cells, is also required for CX3CL1 regulation of NMDA receptor
function (Scianni *et al.*, 2013).

Moreover, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 impact adult neurogenesis along with
synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, which are believed to affect
synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. Accordingly, both
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 axes were reported to be upregulated
following learning (Rogers *et al.*, 2011; Su *et al.*, 2012). In
addition, several lines of evidence illustrated that CX3CL1 modulates
synaptic plasticity in this region (Bertollini *et al.*, 2006; Ragozzino
*et al.*, 2006; Maggi *et al.*, 2009, 2011; Paolicelli *et al.*, 2011;
Rogers *et al.*, 2011) and regulates learning and memory (Maggi *et
al.*, 2011; Rogers *et al.*, 2011; Serchov *et al.*, 2015; Reshef *et
al.*, 2017).

Chemokines’ regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the
hippocampus. Briefly, both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 molecules were shown to
affect synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum (Giovannelli *et al.*,
1998; Ragozzino *et al.*, 2002), and mice with CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup>
receptor deletion were characterized by the long-term potentiation (LTP)
in the spinal cord (Bian *et al.*, 2015). These findings may be
associated with CX3CL1-mediated behavioral consequences regarding motor
coordination and pain (Verge *et al.*, 2004; Rogers *et al.*, 2011). It
also should be noted that another form of synaptic plasticity, i.e.,
synaptic scaling, is widely accepted to be mediated by TNFα (Bezzi *et
al.*, 2001), which is mainly expressed by astrocytes, for example, *via*
CXCR4 activation (Stellwagen & Malenka, 2006). Therefore, by modulating
TNFα levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in
homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity
(Stellwagen & Malenka, 2006).

In addition, mounting evidence shows interactions between the chemokine
system and “classical” neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. For
instance, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the
SN, the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN (Ragozzino *et al.*,
1998; Guyon, Banisadr, *et al.*, 2005; Guyon *et al.*, 2006; Heinisch &
Kirby, 2010). By acting on the presynaptic site, CXCL12 affects the
activity of serotoninergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA), and
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons, thereby
modulating the release of neuroactive molecules (Guyon, Banisadr, *et
al.*, 2005; Guyon *et al.*, 2006; Heinisch & Kirby, 2010). Moreover,
CXCL12 is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these
neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal
nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: Bhattacharyya
*et al.* (2008)). However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized
with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin,
MCH, and DA), postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved
in this phenomenon. For example, in MCH neurons, CXCR4 was described to
directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including
Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels of the action potential
(Guyon, Banisadr, *et al.*, 2005), or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium
currents (Guyon, Rovère, *et al.*, 2005). These results suggest that
CXCL12 signaling may be involved in neuroendocrine functions, including
water/food intake, metabolism, and stress. In line with this notion,
CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding
disorders, such as anorexia. Not only a high-fat diet was reported to
increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides
(e.g., enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the paraventricular
nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH), but also an
intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the
effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus (Poon *et al.*, 2016).
These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in
feeding behavior.

Similarly, the dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of
both pre- and postsynaptic actions of CXCL12. CXCL12 was reported to
enhance the frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory
postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) in this region,
indicating presynaptic mechanisms, which is in line with the documented
presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons (Guyon *et al.*, 2006). In
addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 could act directly as a
neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the
modulation of high voltage activated calcium currents (Guyon *et al.*,
2008). Consistent with this data, by using unilateral intranigral or
intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12, a further study has
illustrated that this chemokine triggered contralateral turns in
circling behavior (Skrzydelski *et al.*, 2007). Of note, considering
that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in dopamine neurons, this
chemokine is speculated to act in an autocrine manner (Guyon *et al.*,
2008). Importantly, some CXCL12-induced increase in an inward current is
suggested to be induced from glutamate release from astrocytes (Guyon
*et al.*, 2006).

<!--chapter:end:01-01-cx3cl1.Rmd-->

Finally, over the last decade, the notion that dysfunctions in the
chemokine system lead to neuropsychiatric diseases has attracted much
attention (for a review Stuart *et al.* (2015)). Broadly, dysfunctions
in the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pairs are similar to “sickness
behavior.” It is a physiological and psychological state characterized
by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation
during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released
proinflammatory cytokines (Dantzer, 2001; Dantzer & Kelley, 2007). Given
the described above, modulation of the release of serotonin in the DRN
as well as involvement in feeding behavior and learning by CX3CL1 and
CXCL12 may affect mood and lead to depression (Maes *et al.*, 1998).
Accordingly, the link between those chemokines and chronic stress is
well-documented (Zhan *et al.*, 2014; Sowa *et al.*, 2017; Piirainen *et
al.*, 2021).

Interestingly, initial behavioral evidence is starting to elucidate the
possible mediation of those chemokines in anxiety-related behavior (Yang
*et al.*, 2016; Bolós *et al.*, 2018; Schubert *et al.*, 2018). Those
types of behavior are widely accepted to be due to dysfunctions in the
functioning of the amygdala. Consistently, this region was reported to
display relatively high expression of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 (Nishiyori *et
al.*, 1998; Tarozzo *et al.*, 2003), strongly suggesting functional
roles of these receptors in the amygdala.

Moreover, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that
peripheral activation of the immune system engages the amygdala (Frenois
*et al.*, 2007; Harrison *et al.*, 2009; Engler *et al.*, 2011). In
addition, activation of the immune system by injection of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors
in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM),
a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: Yang *et al.*
(2016)). Mounting evidence also illustrated many similarities between
dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to
the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part.
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders
(Tovote *et al.*, 2015; Yang *et al.*, 2016; Girgenti *et al.*, 2017),
epilepsy (Fabene *et al.*, 2010; Roseti *et al.*, 2013; Tian *et al.*,
2017; Suleymanova, 2021), obesity (Guillemot-Legris & Muccioli, 2017;
Kawamura *et al.*, 2021), pain (Old & Malcangio, 2012; Mélik
Parsadaniantz *et al.*, 2015; Paretkar & Dimitrov, 2019; Yuan *et al.*,
2020), drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; Coller & Hutchinson
(2012), Freeman *et al.* (2012), Jacobsen *et al.* (2016); Wang *et al.*
(2012)). Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune
modulation in the amygdala.

Finally, recent studies demonstrated glial mediation in behavior,
including in the amygdala (Martin-Fernandez *et al.*, 2017; Althammer
*et al.*, 2020). Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia
signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to
those behaviors.

Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or
CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication
between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity,
and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their
actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit.

<!-- ####  CXCL12- and CX3CL1-induced regulation of neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication {#example}

Here, I will introduce a simplified model of coordinated actions of neuron-glia interactions fine-tuned by chosen chemokines and gliotransmitters. 

As mentioned above, CX3CL1 is the most widely studied chemokines in relation to neuron–microglia crosstalk and regulation of microglial activity. 
Accumulating evidence illustrates that many environmental triggers can up-regulate CX3CL1 expression, including an insult [@hughes_2002], learning [@sheridan_2014], or the presence of another chemokine, CXCL12, *via* its action on neuronal ADAM17 [@cook_2010] (Fig....).

CX3CL1 was shown to exert neuroprotective actions against  Glu-induced  excitotoxicity, with  mechanisms  fully  dependent  on  A~1~R  [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010] and at least partially dependent on  A~3~R  [@rosito_2012; @rosito_2014].
In contrast, NMDA-induced toxicity, mainly mediated by NR2B-containing extrasynaptic  NMDARs, was reported to require A~2A~R and the presence  of D-serine [@scianni_2013; @lauro_2014].
These results highlight that modulation of glial function by adenosine is essential in the context of neuroprotection, as both microglia and astrocytes release it as a gliotransmitter.

Additionally, it is well-established that astrocytes might also exert a neuroprotective role upon brain insult by buffering extracellular Glu [@blanger_2009]. 
Evidence illustrated that CX3CL1, acting on microglia, induced the production and release of adenosine that exerted their effects on astrocytes by binding to A~1~R (Fig. 3D), and consequently inducing the up-regulation of the astrocytic GLT-1 transporter (Fig. 3E, @catalano_2013).
Microglia can also release CXCL12, which then acts, for example, *via* astrocytic CXCR4 and, in turn, produces TNFα, leading to remyelination (see Fig...; @bezzi_2001, @cunha_2020).

To sum up, the  mentioned above findings strongly support the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines are key communicating molecules between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserving brain functions.
Please note that this is a simplification of neuron-microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in the context of neuroprotection, and many other factors and connections are omitted for the sake of clarity. -->
<!--### Chemokines modulates behavior {#behavior}

Since mounting evidence supports the notion that chemokines coordinate several brain circuits of behavioral relevance, including hippocampus, DRN, SN, hypothalamus, it may indicate their contribution to these behaviors.
Consistent with this idea, disturbances of several chemokines/chemokine receptor axes were implicated in the pathophysiology of neurobiological disorders [@paolicelli_2014; @poon_2016; @stuart_2015].
Moreover, despite increasing evidence about the chemokine system's role in mediating homeostatic brain functions, the mechanisms underlying chemokines regulation of behavior under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. 
Hence, here I discuss a handful of studies on the regulation of chemokines on various types of behavior, such as learning and memory, social interactions, locomotor activity, anxiety. 
Results from those studies are summarized in Table 3. 

To sum up, these findings reinforce the idea that chemokines and their receptors are involved in higher brain functions regulating many types of behavior, including cognitive, motor, and emotional behavioral effects.
However, to date, very little is known about their cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological profile with regard to potential interaction with glia to put these results in a broader context. // and glial-mediated mechanisms to put these results in a broader context.///

// dobre połączenie z AMYGDALA///
Although many brain regions have been found to participate in anxiety regulation it is commonly accepted that among them the amygdala plays a prominent role (Canteras et al., 2010; Davis and Whalen, 2001; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Engin and Treit, 2008; Everitt et al., 2003; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000, 2007; McNally et al., 2011; Pape and Paré, 2010; Paré et al., 2004; Pérez de la Mora et al., 2008, 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2009).

Several behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, commonly occur in mice with CX3CR1 deletion. -->
<!-- 
All neuronal circuits of higher animals comprise excitatory and inhibitory neurons forming intense feed-forward and feedback connections [@mohler_1990, @ferrante_2009, @roth_2012].
However, the precise control of network operations would not be possible without interneurons.
Although they constitute only 20-30% of all cells in cortical circuits, this small, diverse group of inhibitory neurons enables higher brain functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, or social interaction (for a review: @mederos_2019). 
Through inhibition, GABAergic interneurons can shape the circuit activity controlling (1) frequency of surrounding pyramidal neurons, (2) network excitation level by feed-forward mechanism, and (3) synchronized oscillation events [@mederos_2019]. 
The importance of interneurons in relation to network functioning illustrates the highly controlled manner by which interneurons connect with other neurons [@tremblay_2016]. 

##### Synaptic scaling {#scal}

In order to prevent the destabilizing component of Hebbian plasticity in network function, neurons are able to sense their excitability and trigger negative-feedback homeostatic mechanisms to counteract perturbations in synaptic activity and restrain it within a dynamical but physiological range [@field_2020]. 
Recent accumulating data also highlight the essential role of glial cells, as they are equipped with, for instance, glutamate transporters to control the concentration of glutamate and other neurotransmitters in the microenvironment. 
Importantly, stable but flexible neural activity is fundamental for proper brain function and support of animal behavior, depending on a dynamic interface between homeostatic synaptic  plasticity  mechanisms  and  Hebbian  forms  of plasticity [@field_2020; @tremblay_2016].-->

## 1.2 Amygdala

The amygdala is a brain structure located in the medial temporal lobe
associated with a broad array of behaviors, such as learning, fear,
anxiety, reward, and addiction (LeDoux, 2000; Ehrlich *et al.*, 2009;
Roozendaal *et al.*, 2009; Herry *et al.*, 2010). Surprisingly, despite
this variety of functions, the amygdala is well-conserved throughout
evolution. Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and
fishes have counterparts with similar circuits and functions to the
amygdala in mammals (for a review: Janak & Tye (2015)). It is speculated
that this may be due to the adaptive context of those phenomena. In
order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must
discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict
potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can
mobilize adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. For example,
during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone
(i.e., the conditioned stimulus \[CS\]), that predicts an aversive
outcome, for example, a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus
\[US\]), results in defensive responses, including freezing behavior
(LeDoux, 2000; Janak & Tye, 2015). Analogously, reward-induced
conditioning responses lead to a cue-triggered behavior (Tye *et al.*,
2008; Clem & Huganir, 2010; Johansen *et al.*, 2010). Thus, both
learning about danger and potential rewards are adaptive and engage the
amygdala (Janak & Tye, 2015).

These distinct behaviors are believed to be reflected by widespread
amygdalar connections with an array of other brain regions, from the
prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: Duvarci & Pare (2014);
Pape & Pare (2010); Sah *et al.* (2003)) as well as is complex inner
structure. This limbic region is comprised of a heterogeneous collection
of nuclei, which can be distinguished based on their different
connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a
review, see: Duvarci & Pare (2014)). Historically, amygdala nuclei are
divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which
includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal
nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the
cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the
centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as
the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area
(AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) (McDonald, 1998; Sah *et
al.*, 2003). Here, the following classification will be used: the
basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA),
and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers
(Bocchio *et al.* (2016); Duvarci & Pare (2014); Ehrlich *et al.*
(2009); Pape & Pare (2010); Spampanato *et al.* (2011), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). Nuclei that do not fall into any of
these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are
described elsewhere (Pitkänen *et al.*, 1997; Sah *et al.*, 2003).

</div>

Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics,
in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology,
have been dissecting how genetically targeted cellular activity within
the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for
example, Lalumiere (2014)). Here, I summarize the current state of
knowledge of the amygdala’s role, anatomy, and physiology. The
physiological and morphological properties of neurons in relation to
specific nuclei are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>,
whereas simplified illustrations of their main inputs, outputs, and
intra-connectivity are depicted in Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>.

### 1.2.1 The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA)

The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus
(LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the
latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (Krettek & Price
(1978), see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). All these nuclei
are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter
this term will be used. The BLA is considered the main input nuclei of
the amygdala (for reviews: Duvarci & Pare (2014); Lalumiere (2014); Sah
& Lopez De Armentia (2003)). Briefly, multisensory and highly processed
information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory,
gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA. It is
carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory,
associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala *via*
the external or internal capsules (for reviews: Hájos (2021); Sah *et
al.* (2003)). A large body of evidence highlights the role of these
terminals in the acquisition of fear and appetitive conditioning, which
is associated with synaptic potentiation in the BLA (Blanchard &
Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux *et al.*, 1990; Tye *et al.*, 2008; Clem &
Huganir, 2010; Johansen *et al.*, 2010). In addition, this nucleus is
strongly innervated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a). Specifically, this
region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from
the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2)
serotonergic projections originating from the DRN, (3) dense
dopaminergic innervation from the VTA and the SN, and (4) projections
from the basal forebrain (Prager *et al.* (2016) and references
therein).

This amygdalar complex displays cortical-like characteristics based on
its developmental origin and structural organization (Waclaw *et al.*,
2010), although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization (Sah
*et al.*, 2003). Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are
glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20%
belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons (McDonald & Augustine,
1993; Spampanato *et al.*, 2011; Duvarci & Pare, 2014). Accordingly,
both principal cells (PCs) and interneurons show many morphological and
electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and
hippocampal counterparts.

Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma,
spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical
dendrite (McDonald (1982a), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). Considering electrophysiological
properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to
depolarizing somatic current injections (Faber *et al.* (2001); Paré *et
al.* (1995), see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). The degree of
this adaptation forms a continuum: at one end, cells fire two to three
spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at
the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current
injection with little accommodation (Funahashi *et al.*, 2000; Faber *et
al.*, 2001).

On the other hand, BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous
subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of
parameters, which is a subject of many excellent reviews (Spampanato *et
al.*, 2011; Prager *et al.*, 2016; Hájos, 2021). Analogous to their
counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA
can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide
contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1)
parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA
interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about
17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are
often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population,
and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing
calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons (Kemppainen & Pitkänen, 2000;
McDonald & Betette, 2001; McDonald & Mascagni, 2001; McDonald &
Mascagni, 2002; Muller *et al.*, 2003).

In contrast to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike
frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current
injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width
0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously *in vivo* at high frequencies
(10-15 Hz) (Paré *et al.*, 1995; Spampanato *et al.*, 2011). Consistent
with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing
properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons (Group *et
al.*, 2008) but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA (Dumont *et
al.*, 2002; Lopez de Armentia & Sah, 2004). Among BLA interneurons,
further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of
firing patterns (Spampanato *et al.*, 2011). Some evidence has
distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a
generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by
PV-expressing cells (Rainnie *et al.* (2006); Woodruff & Sah (2007a),
see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>), whereas CB-immunopositive
neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation (Jasnow *et al.*,
2009). However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is
still unclear. Nevertheless, it is speculated that neurons with
disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct
afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently
(for reviews: Spampanato *et al.* (2011), Tremblay *et al.* (2016)).

Also, contrary to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell
bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA (McDonald &
Betette, 2001; McDonald & Mascagni, 2002; McDonald & Mascagni, 2004).
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted,
bipolar, and chandelier cells (McDonald (1982a); Woodruff *et al.*
(2010), see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). Moreover, although
most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some
interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology (Klenowski *et al.*,
2015). It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch
sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal
neurons.

Principal cells are densely interconnected between subdivisions of the
BLA complex by sending long-distance collaterals (Sah *et al.* (2003);
Smith *et al.* (2000), see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>,
part c). PCs from the lateral part send many projections onto their
counterparts in the basal nuclei (B) (Krettek & Price, 1978; Pitkänen
*et al.*, 1997; Duvarci & Pare, 2014), displaying preferential
lateromedial directionality of those connections. In addition, principal
cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons
(Szinyei *et al.* (2000), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).

BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their
primary source of GABAergic inputs (Bienvenu *et al.* (2012); Muller *et
al.* (2006); Rainnie *et al.* (2006); Woodruff & Sah (2007b), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).

Principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal
dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from
outside and within the BLA (Brinley-Reed *et al.*, 1995; Farb & LeDoux,
1997; Farb & Ledoux, 1999) and proximal dendrites and soma being densely
covered with GABAergic synapses (Klenowski *et al.*, 2015). However,
further ultrastructural analyses revealed that distinct subtypes of
interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target
of PCs. Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing
interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal
cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial
segment (AIS; McDonald & Betette (2001), Muller *et al.* (2005), Muller
*et al.* (2006)). Given that the perisomatic region generates
sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned
inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs’ spiking output
and timing (Woodruff *et al.*, 2006). In contrast, somatostatin-positive
interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these
pyramidal-like neurons (Muller *et al.* (2007), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c). Since these parts of
dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these
GABAergic synapses influence how excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(EPSPs) travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating
voltage-gated conductances. Therefore, inhibitory synapses from
SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation
of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials, dendritic integration,
glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action
potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see:
Tremblay *et al.* (2016)).

Like excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the
BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines. Thus, all these
complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich
cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory
and inhibitory cell types within the BLA. The regulation of the BLA
network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by Prager
*et al.* (2016), as it is beyond the topic of this dissertation.

In addition to their strong regulation of PCs’ activity, BLA
interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of
interneuron-interneuron contacts. Electron microscopy analyses revealed
that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the
latter being mediated by gap junctions (Muller *et al.*, 2005). While
pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the
electrical connection probability among BLA interneurons remains high,
but mainly within the same subtype (Muller *et al.*, 2005; Woodruff &
Sah, 2007b). This notion was further supported by a study using a
conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution
microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or
CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical
synapses (Andrási *et al.* (2017), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).

Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics,
and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for
example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors. In general,
activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic
potentials with fast, GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-dependent, and slow,
GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor-dependent components (Washburn & Moises,
1992a). Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory
components originate from distinct subpopulations of interneurons
(Sugita *et al.*, 1992).

The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain,
connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties
contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory
control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network
computations and flow of information. These are often thought to be
comprised of feedback inhibition (Smith *et al.*, 2000; Unal *et al.*,
2014), feedforward inhibition (Lang & Paré, 1997; Popescu & Paré, 2011;
Bazelot *et al.*, 2015), and disinhibition (Bienvenu *et al.*, 2015)
(for a comprehensive review: Tremblay *et al.* (2016); Woodruff & Sah
(2007a)). Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as
critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA. Indeed,
accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta
and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have
emerged as a key element of emotional learning in the BLA (McDonald &
Mascagni, 2004; Pelletier & Paré, 2004; Bauer *et al.*, 2007; Klenowski
*et al.*, 2015). Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can
coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections,
thereby modulating several behavioral responses (Bauer *et al.*, 2007;
Bienvenu *et al.*, 2012; Courtin *et al.*, 2014; Davis *et al.*, 2017;
Zheng *et al.*, 2017).

It should also be noted that despite being the main input of the
amygdaloid complex, the BLA sends a few projections. Despite its
reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the
hippocampus, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the
nucleus accumbens (NA), indicated as crucial in reward-seeking behavior
(Stuber *et al.*, 2011; Namburi *et al.*, 2015; Beyeler *et al.*, 2016).
Nevertheless, the BLA predominantly projects to the extended amygdala
(see Section <a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a>), the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis (BNST) and the CeA (see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, parts b and c). Those
connections are associated with anxiety and social interactions (Tye *et
al.*, 2011; Felix-Ortiz *et al.*, 2013; Felix-Ortiz & Tye, 2014;
Felix-Ortiz *et al.*, 2016). Notably, the CeA can be innervated by BLA
principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto
CeA neurons (Krettek & Price (1978), Lopez de Armentia & Sah (2004) or
indirectly *via* GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward
inhibition (Jüngling *et al.* (2008); Royer *et al.* (1999), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).

### 1.2.2 Intercalated cell masses

Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic
neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous
small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles
found in and around the BLA. Based on their location, the ITC clusters
are often divided into (1) lateral intercalated cell cluster
(ITC<sub>L</sub>), bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the
external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster
ITC<sub>MP</sub>, localized within the intermediate capsule, which
separates the BLA from the CeA, and (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs,
located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITC<sub>VM</sub>) (Mańko *et al.*
(2011); Millhouse (1986), <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).

Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished:
interneurons with small (10–15 µm) ovoid cell bodies and spiny,
flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle
(Nitecka & Ben-Ari, 1987; McDonald & Augustine, 1993), and larger
(&gt;50 µm) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly
branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA
or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and
endopiriform cortices (Bienvenu *et al.*
(2015),<a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). Moreover, ITCs express the
highest density of µ-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the
whole amygdala (Marowsky *et al.*, 2005; Jacobsen *et al.*, 2006; Pape &
Pare, 2010; Palomares-Castillo *et al.*, 2012), indicating the possible
modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.
Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic
glutamate receptors 1α (mGluR1α), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors α1 subunit,
and PV (Bienvenu *et al.*, 2015). Electrophysiologically, both types of
cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance,
higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA
interneurons (Royer *et al.*, 2000; Geracitano *et al.*, 2007; Busti *et
al.*, 2011; Mańko *et al.*, 2011).

Moreover, intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each
cluster but also between clusters. For example, ITC<sub>L</sub>
interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs
(Strobel *et al.*, 2015), thereby providing feedforward inhibition to
BLA principal neurons (Marowsky *et al.*, 2005). On the other hand, the
BLA mainly targets more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an
inhibitory interface between the BLA and CeA (Busti *et al.* (2011);
Marowsky *et al.* (2005); Royer *et al.* (2000), see Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b). Hence, intercalated
cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting
inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially
by gating CeA output.

### 1.2.3 The central amygdala

The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular
(CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions
(McDonald, 1982b; Jolkkonen & Pitkänen, 1998; Sah *et al.*, 2003).
Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL
(Duvarci & Pare, 2014). Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the
BNST and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the
extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and
inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their
dense intra-connectivity (Krettek & Price (1978) and for a review: Fox
*et al.* (2015), Gilpin *et al.* (2015), Sah *et al.* (2003)). However,
here we focus mainly on the CeA.

Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus (Ciocchi
*et al.*, 2010; Haubensak *et al.*, 2010; Hou *et al.*, 2016). However,
similar to the BLA, there are also exceptions from this oversimplified
model, and both CeM and CeL receive direct projections outside the
amygdala (see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a)).
Among others, neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus
(PVT, Do-Monte *et al.* (2015), Penzo *et al.* (2015)), the BNST (Gungor
*et al.*, 2015), parabrachial nucleus (PBN; Carter *et al.* (2013)) or
oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus (Knobloch *et al.*, 2012)
sends projections to this region, influencing diverse set of behaviors.

Neurons within this nucleus are a diverse group of GABAergic
interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their
morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well
as connectivity and *in vivo* patterns of activity. Morphologically,
they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons (McDonald &
Augustine, 1993; Sun & Cassell, 1993), further supporting the notion of
different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA (Medina *et al.*,
2004; Waclaw *et al.*, 2010). More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have
similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (i.e., a small soma and
numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM
neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low
density of dendritic spines (Cassell & Gray (1989); McDonald (1982b),
see Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). Based on neuronal
electrophysiological firing profiles, two major types have been
described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced
delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in
response to depolarizing somatic current injections (Hou *et al.*,
2016), and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive
firing spikes (Dumont *et al.*, 2002; Lopez de Armentia & Sah, 2004).
Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this
region. The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA
neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4)
low-threshold bursting cells (Martina *et al.*, 1999). The latter is
characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency
(&gt;40 Hz) with no accommodation (Dumont *et al.*, 2002), as their
counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA. Moreover, their
action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around
0.6 ms compared with &gt; 1 ms in other cell types in CeA (Dumont *et
al.*, 2002). The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed
with T-type calcium channels, which are thought to contribute to
characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to
depolarizing current pulses as well as rebound spikes when
hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied (Dumont *et al.*, 2002; Hou
*et al.*, 2016).

Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and
markers, including SOM, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ),
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR),
enkephalin (ENK), and others (Cassell & Gray, 1989; Haubensak *et al.*,
2010). Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in
CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic
subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive.

Generally, the CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal
subpopulations with different functional and molecular features (Cassell
& Gray, 1989; Martina *et al.*, 1999; Lopez de Armentia & Sah, 2004;
Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010; Haubensak *et al.*, 2010; Li *et al.*, 2013; Hou
*et al.*, 2016). PKCδ-expressing neurons form a relatively homogeneous
group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (∼85%; Haubensak *et al.*
(2010)). The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons
(Haubensak *et al.*, 2010). Functionally, following fear-conditioning,
these neurons display a reduced firing and thus are often referred to as
CeL<sub>OFF</sub> cells (Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010; Haubensak *et al.*,
2010). Moreover, almost half of the PKCδ neurons co-express ENK or OR,
which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM (Huber *et al.*,
2005; Haubensak *et al.*, 2010; Viviani *et al.*, 2011).

On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKCδ marker express SOM
(Haubensak *et al.*, 2010; Li *et al.*, 2013). Those cells display
heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all
SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining
40% are classified as LF (Li *et al.*, 2013). Moreover, during
fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in
their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear
memory (Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010; Haubensak *et al.*, 2010; Li *et al.*,
2013; Hou *et al.*, 2016). Importantly, sole activation of those neurons
is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice (Li *et
al.*, 2013). Therefore, they have often been termed CeL<sub>ON</sub>
neurons. Many findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of
SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF (Pomrenze *et
al.*, 2015; McCullough *et al.*, 2018). Accordingly, as PKCδ and CRF- or
SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal
populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional
roles.

CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form
synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical
subtypes (Fig. <a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c). For
example, synapses formed between LF→RS and RS→LF neurons were reported
to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the
same class (Hou *et al.*, 2016).

It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal
activity of the CeL is required for fear acquisition, whereas activity
in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses
(Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010). Moreover, CeM activation alone is
well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing
(LeDoux *et al.*, 1988), whereas CeL neurons were revealed to tonically
inhibit CeM output (Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010; Gozzi *et al.*, 2010).
Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in
local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PKCδ-expressing cells
than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable
projections to the CeM (Li *et al.*, 2013). In contrast, the
PKCδ-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons
(Haubensak *et al.* (2010); Li *et al.* (2013), Fig.
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c). Hence, during the
presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically
inhibited by CeL<sub>ON</sub>, SOM-immunopositive neurons (Gozzi *et
al.*, 2010), leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction
of freezing. However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced,
PKCδ-expressing CeL<sub>OFF</sub> projection neurons become active,
inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output. Therefore, the balance
between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly
impacts the behavioral output of this region.

CeA projections are illustrated in Figure
<a href="#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b. Broadly, both CeM and
CeL neurons send substantial projections, especially to the
periaqueductal gray (PAG), but also the BNST and LC, affecting fear- and
anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing (Asok *et al.*, 2018;
Paretkar & Dimitrov, 2018). Moreover, in addition to its well-known role
in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the
pain pathway (Paretkar & Dimitrov, 2019). Reward-related behaviors are
modulated not only by CeA projections to the SN, the VTA, and the LH
(Tsumori *et al.*, 2006; Reyes *et al.*, 2011; Pomrenze *et al.*, 2015)
but also CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC (Seo *et al.*,
2016), which stimulation was shown to mediate brain reward function. CeM
cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) are also implicated
in autonomic regulation (Viviani *et al.*, 2011).

### 1.2.4 Summary

Taken together, each nucleus receives a unique set of multiple inputs
from distinct brain regions. These combinations of connections between
BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by
intercalated neurons, enable increasing or decreasing the amplitude of
the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are
activated and in what sequence. Thus, the CeA output depends not only on
the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and
origin. All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial
role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory
formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and
homeostatic control. Considering this diversity, it is not surprising
that the disruption of the amygdala functioning is associated with many
disorders, including alcoholism and other reward-related disorders,
anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and stress-related disorders,
autism, obesity, epilepsy, pain, just to list a few. Thus, the amygdala
functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant
sensory information about the external and internal environment into
behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in
homeostasis. Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are
well-conserved across evolution (Jarvis *et al.*, 2005), better
understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the
potential to be directly relevant to humans.

# 2 Aim of the study

Considering described evidence, this dissertation aimed to investigate
the modulation of two amygdalar subdivisions, namely BLA and CeA, by two
chosen chemokines. I focused on CXCL12 and CX3CL1, as they, together
with their receptors, were implicated in neurodevelopmental processes,
synaptic transmission, neuroimmune responses, and glial regulation.
Moreover, the amygdala is involved in the pathophysiology of several
neurological diseases, including neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and
anxiety, in which both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 pairs are thought
to play an important role. To better understand chemokines’ modulation
at the network level of the whole complex of the amygdala, both the main
input nucleus (the basolateral complex) and the main output nucleus (the
central complex) were investigated.

Previous studies have demonstrated complex electrophysiological effects
of CXCL12 and CX3CL1, which differ between, among others, brain regions
or neuronal populations (see Section:
<a href="#chemointheCNS">1.1.3</a>). Receptors of CXCL12 and CX3CL1
chemokines are also located in the amygdala (see Sections:
<a href="#CX3CL1str">1.1.2.2</a> and <a href="#CXCL12str">1.1.2.3</a>);
however, little is known about their functional consequences. Thus, the
aim of this dissertation was to investigate the electrophysiological
role of chosen chemokines and their receptors in the BLA and the CeA.

Moreover, at least some chemokine-triggered actions were mediated by
glial cells. Accordingly, this dissertation further aimed to dissect the
complex mechanisms underlying bidirectional crosstalk between neurons
and glial cells (i.e., astrocytes and microglia) regarding its
regulation of membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the
amygdala.

The central hypotheses of the research presented here are:

1.  Chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed in the BLA and/or
    CeA in both neuronal and glial cells.

2.  Chemokines directly and/or indirectly *via* glial modulation alter
    neuronal membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the
    basolateral and/or central nuclei of the amygdala.

Therefore, this project can be sub-divided into four separate but
physiologically and functionally related parts.

1.  Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CX3CL1 and its
    receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat basolateral nucleus of the amygdala.

2.  Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CX3CL1 and its
    receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat central nucleus

3.  Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CXCL12 and their
    receptor, CXCR4, in the rat basolateral nucleus

4.  Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CXCL12 and their
    receptor, CXCR4, in the rat central nucleus

To address these issues, a whole-cell patch-clamp technique,
supplemented with pharmacological approach, was employed. Precisely, to
examine the membrane properties and synaptic transmission of BLA and CeA
neurons in brain slices and their sensitivity to chosen chemokine
treatment, *in vitro* whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed
in rat brain slices containing the amygdala. BLA or CeA neuron membrane
properties, spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
transmission (sEPSCs/mEPSCs/sIPSCs/mIPSCs) were collected before and
after bath application of chosen chemokines. Notably, to verify whether
astrocytes or microglia are involved in observed effects, in subsets of
experiments, recordings were made in the presence of either astrocytic
toxin (i.e., fluorocitrate) or the inhibitor of microglial activity
(i.e., minocycline). To gain additional insights into the role of
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the amygdala, additional experiments were
made to measure their potential modulation of synaptic plasticity. The
co-localization of CX3CR1 expression with neuronal markers such as MAP2
or CAMKIIα was also examined by using immunohistochemistry.

# 3 Materials and methods

## 3.1 General

### 3.1.1 Ethic approval

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the directive
2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September
2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.
Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were
additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the
Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15
January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal
Research (Krakow, Poland). All efforts were made to minimize suffering
and to reduce the number of animals used.

### 3.1.2 Animals

Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Research Models and Services;
Germany).<!-- Po dostawie zwierzęta przechodziły kilkudniową adaptację do warunków pomieszczenia hodowlanego -->
Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm)
lined with wooden bedding in a controlled environment (22 ± 1°C, 45 ± 5
% relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.)
with commercial food and fresh water *ad libitum*. Animals were
acclimated to the housing environment for at least four days before the
beginning of the experiments. For patch-clamp experiments, rats weighing
180-300g (5-10 weeks of age) were used. For immunostaining experiments,
rats weighing 300-350 g were used. <!--zwierzęta na hodowle--> Animals
at this age are considered young adults. The age of the animals for each
experiment was determined to assure credible and interpretable results.

### 3.1.3 Reagents

In electrophysiological experiments, all reagents used for preparing
ACSF and internal solution were purchased from Roth (Carl Roth GmbH,
Germany) and bath-applied by a peristaltic pump, unless stated
otherwise.<!--All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).  czy na pewno? --><!-- Details regarding the primary and secondary antibodies used in our immunohistochem istry experiments are provided in Table 2 - 1. --><!-- All reagents for phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), artificial cerebrospinal fluid and intrapipette solution (ACSF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), apart from single biocytin batches purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK, Cat No. 3349). Pertussis toxin was purchased from Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, Cat No. PHZ1174). -->
<!-- The time necessary for the solution to flow from the stopcocks to the slice was approximately 15 s. -->

Other electrophysiological reagents suppliers and used doses were as
follows: 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, a voltage-gated sodium channel
blocker from Tocris Bioscience, UK), 100 μM picrotoxin (a
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist from Tocris Bioscience, UK),  
10 μM CGP52432 (a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist from Tocris
Bioscience, UK).

Chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were purchased from R&D Systems. All
peptides were dissolved in sterile PBS, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C,
unless stated otherwise. Concentrations for both chemokines were 2 and
5nM.

For blocking CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors, highly selective antagonists
(AZD8797 and AMD3100) were used, respectively. AZD8797 was obtained from
Axon Medchem, The Netherlands, and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and used at the concentration of AZD8797 was 10μM. AMD3100 was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and its final concentration was 1μM.

For microglia and astrocytes inhibition, the minocycline and
fluorocitric acid were used, respectively. Both reagents were obtained
from Sigma Aldrich. Minocycline was freshly dissolved in ACSF at the
final concentration (20μM) before recordings. Fluorocitric acid was used
at concentration 100μM.

The determination of the doses for CX3CL1, CXCL12, AZD8797, AMD3100,
minocycline, and fluorocitric acid was based on previous studies
(Heinisch & Kirby, 2009; Heinisch & Kirby, 2010; Scianni *et al.*, 2013;
Sheridan *et al.*, 2014; Yang *et al.*, 2016; Baxter *et al.*, 2021).

All drugs were dissolved in deionized water, aliquoted, and stored at
-20°C, unless stated otherwise. The drugs were diluted to the final
concentration in the recording ACSF just before use.

## 3.2 Electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices

### 3.2.1 Tissue preparation for electrophysiological experiments

Male Wistar (6-7-week-old) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane
(AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m.
Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF
(artificial cerebrospinal–fluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76
NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25
glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2
Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>), pH 7.4;
osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg<sup>−1</sup>) and cut into 300 μm thick
coronal sections for patch-clamp experiments and 400 μm thick coronal
sections for extracellular recordings on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating
microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). After slicing, brain slices
containing the amygdala were transferred and held in an incubation
chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 glucose, 5
Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290–300
mOsmol kg<sup>−1</sup>). Slices were incubated at 31–33°C for 20 min and
then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT).
After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a
recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of a Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss,
Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min)
with carbogenated, warm (32°C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35;
osmolarity 290–300 mOsmol kg<sup>−1</sup>).

### 3.2.2 Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition

Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic
morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference
contrast (DIC). The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD
camera and displayed on a computer monitor. The border of the
basolateral and central amygdala was identified based on visual control
by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos
Atlas (Paxinos & Watson, 2007), corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal
to bregma (see Figure: <a href="#fig:methodpatch">3.1</a>). Neurons with
a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and
parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. Cells were approached
under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional
micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland).
Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass
capillaries (3–6 MΏ; Sutter Instruments, USA) using a horizontal puller
(Sutter Instruments P–97) and filled with the following solutions.

gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5
Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.35,
osmolarity 290-300 mOsmol kg<sup>−1</sup>) and biocytin (0.1%, for
subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). For
experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution
contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10
phosphocreatine-Na<sub>2</sub>, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35;
osmolarity 280-290 mOsmol kg<sup>−1</sup>.

The pipette was positively pressurized to help prevent contamination of
the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity
of the membrane, keeping a positive pressure. After forming a
high-resistance seal (&gt; 1 GΏ, cell-attached configuration) between
the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure,
the second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of
membrane enclosed with the pipette’s tip and access inside of the
neuron. Electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode
was established (whole-cell configuration). After break-in, cells
stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly
diffuses from the pipette into the cytoplasm. Ground electrode, which
was chloride-coated silver wire in a chamber filled with bath solution,
kept the electrical potential of the outer side of the cell membrane at
0 mV. The electrical potential of the inner side of the cell membrane
was controlled through a patch electrode filled with the intrapipette
solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4
Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon
Instrument, USA). Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at
20kHz, and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata
1440, Molecular Devices, USA). Data were stored on a computer disk and
analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA).
All membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential
(estimated as ∼12 mV). The access resistance was monitored throughout
each experiment. Only recordings with stable access resistance lower
than 20 MΏ were considered acceptable for analysis. All drugs were
delivered *via* a bath perfusion system.<!-- antibodies? -->
<!--  Neurons firing at less than 0.1 Hz were considered ‘silent neurons’ and excluded from analysis.// The sole criterion for selection of recorded cells was the absence of an apical dendrite.-->

#### 3.2.2.1 Recording protocols, data analysis, and statistics

Whole-cell patch-clamp can detect transmembrane currents under
voltage-clamp configuration or measure membrane voltages under
current-clamp configuration. Hence, to measure the effects of chemokines
(CX3CL1/CXCL12) on intrinsic membrane properties, the experiments were
recorded in the whole-cell patch-clamp under the current-clamp
configuration. The measured features are illustrated in Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodIV">3.2</a>. First, 10 minutes after breaking into
the cell, the resting membrane potential (RMP) was recorded. Then,
several membrane parameters were assessed based on neuronal voltage
responses from -65 mV holding potential to hyper- and depolarizing
current pulses (500 ms, 10 or 5pA increments), and analyzed using custom
scripts.<!-- In order to characterize the behavior of recorded neurons, 22 electrophysiological parameters were measured-->
An input resistance (R<sub>m</sub>), a membrane time constant
(τ<sub>m</sub>), and membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) were
determined in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses eliciting
voltage shifts whose amplitude was 10–20 mV negative to
rest.<!-- (Kawaguchi 1993) // inne cytowanie--> R<sub>m</sub> was
measured following Ohm’s law (R<sub>m</sub> =
$\\frac{dV\~m\~}{I}$)<!--(R~m~ = dV~m~/ I)-->, where dV<sub>m</sub> is
the change in membrane potential in response to - 20 pA (500 ms) current
injection (I). τ<sub>m</sub> was determined at the beginning of the
voltage response and computed by fitting it to a single exponential.
C<sub>m</sub> calculated according to the equation C<sub>m</sub>=
$\\frac{\\tau\~m\~}{R\~m\~}$).

Cell excitability was determined by analyzing the number of action
potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a
linear regression model (see Fig. <a href="#fig:methodIV">3.2</a>, parts
a and b). A gain (slope) and a threshold current/rheobase (minimal
current necessary to fire the first action potential) were determined
for further analysis. An action potential threshold corresponding to the
voltage threshold of the first action potential elicited by a current
step was defined as the voltage at which the time derivative of
V<sub>m</sub>($\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$) is 20 V
s<sup>−1</sup>. The spike latency (often referred to as onset or delay)
was measured from the start of square depolarizing current pulse
injection to the peak of the first action potential evoked by the
rheobase. The amplitude of the first action potential (AP; measured from
the threshold to the positive peak of the rheobase) and AP width
(measured at half-amplitude) were also analyzed. The maximal firing rate
(F<sub>max</sub>) was defined as the trace with the largest number of
action potentials. The first interspike interval (ISI<sub>first</sub>,
in ms) was defined as the time interval between the threshold of the
first action potential and the threshold of the second action potential
in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current
injection.<!--należałoby dodać threshold--> The last interspike interval
(ISI<sub>last</sub>, in ms) was defined as the time interval between the
threshold of the penultimate action potential and the threshold of the
last action potential in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current
injection. The spike adaptation ratio was regarded as the ratio of
ISI<sub>first</sub> to ISI<sub>last</sub>.

In some cases, especially in the CeL neurons, the sag, post-inhibitory
rebound spikes, or spontaneous firing were present. However, these
features were scarce and were not considered in further analysis due to
the possibility of inconsistent results.

In another set of experiments, the aim was to investigate the influence
of either CX3CR1 or CXCR4 receptors activation on
sEPSCs/mEPSCs/sIPSCs/mIPSCs, performed in normal ACSF and ACSF
containing TTX (500 nM), respectively in the voltage-clamp configuration
(see Fig. <a href="#fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC">3.3</a>). The details of
additional experimental conditions are provided in Results (Chapter
<a href="#results">4</a>).
<!-- wytlumaczyć skróty podobnie jak chemokiny (sEPSC/mEPSC/sIPSC/mIPSC)-->
<!-- The calculated reversal potential for Cl- currents in these patch-clamp recordings equalled -90.51 mV, pominąć raczej -->
At holding potential of -70mV, inward events represented excitatory
postsynaptic currents (Fig. <a href="#fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC">3.3</a>a),
whereas to record inhibitory postsynaptic currents, neurons were
voltage-clamped at 0 mV and represented as outward events (Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC">3.3</a>b). After 10 min of the
stabilization period, the baseline postsynaptic currents activity was
recorded. The action of chosen chemokine was measured before (baseline)
and during 15 min of chemokine superfusion. For analysis, the
4-minute-long recordings from baseline and after 15 minutes of chemokine
application were
selected.<!--The nature of postsynaptic currents was verified using glutamate (10 μM CNQX, 50 μM DL-AP5 and GABA (20 μM bicuculline) receptor antagonists (Fig. M2 B, C)  chyba mam tylko bicuculine... może jakaś zamykająca się komórka...? albo któryś z fluorocitrate? albo jakaś tomkowa, ktora nic nie ma? -->
From detected events, their median frequency, amplitude, rise time, and
decay time were measured (see Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodsEPSCsIPSC">3.3</a>). These parameters were
statistically tested (baseline versus chemokine application). Group data
for excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as
median±SD.

At first, postsynaptic currents were detected using Mini Analysis
(Synaptosoft Inc., USA) or TaroTools toolbox for Igor Pro
(<https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister>, v8.0.4, USA).
However, these software required subjective selection of the threshold
amplitude of events and visual inspection of the researcher to prevent
the inclusion of false data. It leads to a semi-automatic approach,
which might be prone to error and researcher bias. Thus, a machine
learning-based approach was used. To this end, Eventer (Winchester *et
al.*, 2020) software allowed training a model to implement consistent
selection criteria across data sets without bias. The same traces were
analyzed using all of these software and selection based on models
trained in Eventer was the most rigorous, thereby the occurrence of
false positive events is less likely. Importantly, the differences
between the control and experimental conditions remained unchanged (data
not shown). Hence, the synaptic transmission data presented in this
dissertation was done using a machine-learning approach in Eventer
software.

All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 (R Core Team,
2021), with mainly the dplyr (v0.8.3; Wickham *et al.* (2021)), and the
ggplot2 (v3.2.1; Wickham (2016)) packages. To compare membrane
properties and synaptic transmission between different groups, they were
analyzed using paired t-test. For non-normally distributed data, the
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used.
<!-- Statistical comparisons were conducted using Repeat-measure, two-way and one-way ANOVA followed Tukey's HSD test using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05.-->

#### 3.2.2.2 Electrophysiological identification and classification of neurons in the BLA and CeA

Once the whole-cell recording was obtained, the cell’s characteristics
were recorded using current-clamp techniques. Neurons were identified by
location, the shape of a cell body, and morphology, but mainly by
specific firing properties (see Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodpatch">3.1</a>).

##### 3.2.2.2.1 Electrophysiological identification of principal cells in the BLA

Principal neurons were identified based on their unique set of features
(see section Amygdala <a href="#BLA">1.2.1</a>).

The classification was made using criteria derived from other
morphological and electrophysiological studies (Washburn & Moises,
1992b; Paré *et al.*, 1995; Faber & Sah, 2002; Sosulina *et al.*, 2006;
Jasnow *et al.*, 2009; Popescu & Paré, 2011).<!-- perumal_2021 --> In
addition to their pyramidal-like soma shape, these cells were
distinguished from a heterogeneous group of interneurons based on such
firing properties: (a) their prominent spike adaptation ratio, (b) low
excitability (around 6-20 Hz), (c) absence of spontaneous firing, (d)
low input resistance (50-100 MΩ), and (e) comparatively long duration of
action potential (&lt; 0.8 ms at half-amplitude). Considering the
heterogeneity of principal cells, especially with regard to adaptation
ratio, the more reliable criteria were the action potential duration,
the first inter-spike interval, and low input. Thus, neurons whose
action potential was wider than 0.8 ms, first ISI exceeded 20ms and
showing input resistance larger than 150 MΩ were excluded from further
analysis.

Given that principal cells constitute around 90% of the whole neuronal
population in the BLA, by chance alone, a sample of BLA neurons should
mainly comprise this class of neurons. Hence, by applying these strict
criteria, the probability of including interneurons in the further
analysis<!--misclassification interneurons as principal cells--> was
much lowered.

##### 3.2.2.2.2 Electrophysiological identification of neurons in the CeA

Neurons in the CeL display heterogeneous intrinsic excitability (Amano
*et al.* (2012); Haubensak *et al.* (2010); Hou *et al.* (2016); Hunt
*et al.* (2017); Lopez de Armentia & Sah (2004); Martina *et al.*
(1999); Sah & Lopez De Armentia (2003); see chapter Amygdala
<a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a>).<!--Chieng et al., 2006 ; Chiang et al., 2015,-->
Based on their response to somatic current injections, the majority of
them (\~96%) exhibit either the Regular-Spiking or the Late-Firing
phenotype in response to depolarizing current steps. The remaining 4%
comprise other types of CeL neurons (often designated as fast-spiking
and low-firing); however, they were encountered too infrequently (3.5
and 1.5%, respectively) to allow reliable quantitative analyses. Thus,
they were excluded from further analysis.

The Late-Firing neurons show a significant delay before the onset of the
first action potential (∼100–200 ms). During this delay, the membrane
potential depolarized slowly in such a way there is a depolarizing ramp
(see Fig. <a href="#fig:methodsBLACeAIVrep">3.4</a>b, upper trace).
Little or no spike-frequency adaptation was seen in these neurons. The
Regular-Spiking neurons, also described as Early-Spiking, exhibit
shorter AP onset, ∼50 ms, and a more prominent adaptation ratio.

However, similar to what was observed by Hunt *et al.* (2017), the AP
onset highly varied in recorded cells regardless of their type. Given
that the classification based on the presence of spike frequency
accommodation was reported to be reliable (Hou *et al.*, 2016; Hunt *et
al.*, 2017), the classification was based on both the AP onset and the
presence of spike frequency adaptation.<!--okropne zdanie...--> In
addition, regarding experiments measuring inhibitory synaptic
transmission, the cesium-based internal solution was used, which
significantly altered the action potential properties of neurons shortly
after the beginning of the recordings (Golding *et al.*, 1999). The
identification of CeL neurons included in the present study was
therefore achieved immediately after rupture of the Gigaseal by
evaluating the firing response to the injecting of depolarizing current.
Additional verification was also the observation that even during
long-lasting recordings, Late-Firing neurons exhibited the presence of
the depolarizing ramp at subthreshold current step.

### 3.2.3 Extracellular recordings, data acquisition, and statistics

*Extracellular recordings and analysis was done by Bartosz Bobula, PhD,
from the Department of Physiology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish
Academy of Sciences*

As the BLA is widely known to be involved in emotional learning and
memory, and mounting evidence points to CX3CL1 as a crucial player in
these phenomena, additional experiments investigating the role of CX3CL1
in the BLA LTP was performed. Slices containing the BLA were transferred
to an interface recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a
recording ACSF (33.5 ± 0.5°C), the same as for patch-clamp recordings.
Recordings began approx. 1.5 h after slice preparation.

For field potentials (FPs) recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode
and a recording electrode were visually positioned under a dissecting
microscope in the external capsule and the basolateral region of the
amygdala, respectively, as shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodpatch">3.1</a> A Pt-Ir electrode (CBARC85, FHC, USA)
was used for stimulation, whereas recordings were made using ACSF-filled
glass micropipettes (1–2 MΩ), pulled from borosilicate capillaries using
a List-Medical L/M 3P-A micropipette puller. The recording electrode was
placed in the slice in the area corresponding with the BLA. Stimuli
(duration: 0.2 ms) were applied at 0.016 Hz using a constant-current
stimulus isolation unit (WPI). Signals<!--FPs--> were amplified
(Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, USA), filtered (1-500 Hz), A/D converted
at 10 kHz and stored using the Micro1401 interface and SIGAVG 4 software
(CED, UK). A stimulus–response (input–output) curve was obtained for
each slice. For that purpose, stimulation intensity was progressively
elevated step-wise (21 steps; 0–100 μA, with 5 μA increments). In all
experiments, baseline responses were established by delivering a
stimulation of sufficient intensity<!--(300 e 800mA)--> to elicit a
response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field
potentials, which was fixed at this level throughout all experiments.
Stimulus-response curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation:
V<sub>i</sub>= V<sub>max</sub> /(1 + exp((u-uh)/-S)), where
V<sub>max</sub> is the maximum FP amplitude; u—stimulation intensity;
uh—stimulation intensity evoking the FP of half-maximum amplitude;
S—factor proportional to the slope of the curve.

To measure the short-term plasticity, the paired-pulse stimulation
protocol was used (duration—0.2 ms, inter-stimulus interval ISI—50ms).
The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the ratio of the amplitude
of the second FP to the amplitude of the first FP.

After 15 minutes of baseline recording, the LTP was induced using theta
burst stimulation (TBS). It consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz,
repeated five times every 15 s. Each train consisted of five pulses at
100 Hz. During TBS, pulse duration was extended to 0.3 ms. Field
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded at 0.016 Hz
for another hour. The amount of LTP was determined as an average
increase in the amplitude of FPs recorded between 45 and 60 min after
TBS, relative to baseline. The health of the slice was monitored by
continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout
experiments. Slices displaying unstable baseline recording were
discarded. Data are presented as group means ± SEM. Statistical
significance was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test or ANOVA with
post hoc Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism v9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).

## 3.3 Immunohistochemistry

### 3.3.1 Immunohistochemistry in primary neuronal cultures from amygdala

*The preparation of neuronal cultures and imaging was done by Izabela
Figiel-Ożóg, PhD and Prof. Jakub Włodarczyk from Laboratory of Cell
Biophysics, Nencki Institute, Warsaw.*

Primary cultures of amygdala neurons were prepared from postnatal day 0
(P0) Wistar rats. Animals were decapitated, and the amygdala was removed
and immersed in ice-cold dissection buffer (DB) containing: 120 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, and 9 mM D-glucose. Amygdala tissue was sliced
and then enzymatically digested with a mixture of protease A (P5147,
Sigma-Aldrich) and thermolysin (P1512, Sigma-Aldrich) in DB at room
temperature for 30 minutes. The cells were then dissociated by
triturating with pasteur pipette in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS,
14175095, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 80 µg/ml DNase
(DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 250 x g.
Resulting cell pellet was suspended in plating media consisting of:
Neurobasal A (10888022, ThermoFisher Scientific), B27 supplement
(17504044, ThermoFisher Scientific), Glutamax (35050061, ThermoFisher
Scientific), Penicillin-streptomycin (15140122, ThermoFisher
Scientific), and 5% fetal bovine serum (16140071, ThermoFisher
Scientific). Cells were plated at density 50,000 cells per 13 mm
diameter coverslips coated with 50 µg/ml poly-D-lysine (P7886,
Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 µg/ml laminin. Next day a medium was exchanged
for maintenance medium (Neurobasal A, B27 supplement, Glutamax, and
Penicillin-streptomycin). The cultures were kept in a humidified
incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2, and medium was changed every 5 days.

After 2 weeks in vitro, the cultures were used for immunofluorescence
staining. The cells were fixed in a mixture of 4% (wt/vol)
paraformaldehyde (PFA)/4% (wt/vol) sucrose/PBS for 6 min at room
temperature. After nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with rabbit
anti-CX3CR1 (1:250) diluted in 2% BSA/PBS at 4°C overnight. Following
washing with PBS, a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa
Fluor 555 was applied for 1 h 1 h at room temperature. The cells were
washed again with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
(PBST) for 5 min, and incubated with chicken anti-MAP2 antibody (1:10
000), followed by incubation with secondary anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488
antibody. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in an
anti-quenching medium (Fluoromount) and subjected to imaging analysis.
The images were acquired under a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (63×
objective, 1.4 NA).

### 3.3.2 Immunohistochemistry on brain slices

Rats (n = 6) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100
mg/kg, i.p) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described
in the study by Maćkowiak *et al.* (2011). After a post-fixation period
of 12 h, 50μm-thick sections of the brain were cut in the coronal plane
using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000).

To analyze co-localization of CX3CR1 with
neurons<!--inaczej to ująć bo nie tylko neurons--> in the BLA or CeA,
slices containing amygdala were initially washed in PBS (3 × 10 min
each) and then blocked for 1 h (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05%
Triton X-100 in PBS). CX3CR1 localization to neurons was determined by a
sequential incubation of brain slices with a rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody
(1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs, USA) with a mouse anti-CAMKIIα (1:1000;
Invitrogen, USA). Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4°C,
and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse
antibodies. Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa
647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch, USA) and an Alexa 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse
secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) for 1 h at room
temperature in the dark.

Next, brain sections were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and
placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat
secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and CX3CL1,
and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCL12 and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room
temperature in the
dark.<!-- zmienić ...// Slices were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and incubated for 2 h in secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rabbit; 1:500 dilution; Invitrogen A-11011). -->

A polyclonal goat antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 19 amino acids in the C-terminus of SDF-1? of human origin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis with the polyclonal goat antibody from Santa Cruz recognized a single band (Miller et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007), corresponding to the 10 kD molecular weight of SDF-1? (De et al., 2004; Kryczek et al., 2005). Preabsorption of the SDF-1? antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6193P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile corresponding with in situ hybridization for SDF-1α mRNA in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of SDF-1α in brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and oculomotor nuclei using the Santa Cruz SDF-1α antibody (Banisadr et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Callewaere et al., 2006) as well as other SDF-1α antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002)./// To detect CXCR4-immunoreactivity in the rat brain, we used a polyclonal goat antibody prepared from a 20 amino acid peptide to the C-terminus of CXCR4 receptor of human origin obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In western blot analysis, the antibody revealed a 45 kD band in both cultured neurons and rat brain samples, corresponding to the expected molecular mass for CXCR4 (Pujol et al., 2005). Preincubation of the polyclonal goat CXCR4 antibody overnight with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-6190P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eliminated specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a). Furthermore, immunolabeling with this antibody produced a localization profile matching in situ hybridization for CXCR4 mRNA in neurons within the ventricular ependyma, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate putamen, and cerebellum (Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2007). The immunolocalization of CXCR4 within brain slices was consistent with previous studies in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus using the Santa Cruz CXCR4 antibody (Banisadr et al., 2002a; Baudouin et al., 2006) as well as other CXCR4 antibodies (Stumm et al., 2002). /// The polyclonal goat fractalkine antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 20 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of fractalkine of human origin. Western blot analysis detected a single band with a molecular size of approximately 95 kD, which was consistent with the previously described size of glycosylated fractalkine (Muehlhoefer et al., 2000). Preabsorption of the fractalkine antibody with a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (sc-7225P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) eliminated any specific staining (Figure 2-1), confirming preabsorption controls for this antibody in non-neuronal cells (Habasque et al., 2003). Fractalkine detection on immune cells by immunohistochemistry using this antibody was also confirmed by single cell RT- PCR (Nanki et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Santa Cruz antibody, which was directedagainst the C-terminus of fractalkine, offered the same staining patterns in brain tissue as another antibody, which was directed against the N-terminus of fractalkine, in the cytoplasm of neurons located in the hippocampus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Lindia et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007). A polyclonal rabbit CX3CR1 antibody raised against E. coli expressed rat CX3CR1 mapping to amino acids 2-22 in the N-terminal domain was obtained from Torrey Pines Biolabs (East Orange, NJ). Western blot analysis revealed a specific band at approximately 40 kD corresponding to the molecular weight of CX3CR1 (Meucci et al., 2000; Zhuang et al., 2007). The specificity of the immunohistochemical staining of the CX3CR1 antibody was tested in previous preabsorption studies (Meucci et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2006; Furuichi et al., 2006) and by our preabsorption experiments in brain slices using a tenfold excess of the immunogenic peptide (Figure 2-1). Staining patterns with a CX3CR1 antibody from Torrey Pines Biolabs corresponded with in situ hybridization studies for the mRNA of CX3CR1 in the rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (Verge et al., 2004). The staining of brain sections with this antibody produced a pattern of CX3CR1 immunoreactivity that was consistent with previous labeling of neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Hughes et al., 2002; Verge et al., 2004; Zhuang et al., 2007). - - PHD thesis ///
The staining pattern and specificity of the TPH, NeuN, and CD11b antibodies we used in our studies are well established in the rat brain. When brain tissue was stained with these antibodies (Table 2-1), it produced a pattern that was identical to previously published reports for TPH (Pelaez et al., 2002), NeuN (Lindia et al., 2005; Karuppagounder et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2004) and CD11b (Karuppagounder, 2007).-->

Extracellular recordings from the LA and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. /// analogous

Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and TBS only induces a weak LA-LTP (Drephal, Schubert, & Albrecht, 2006), we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50% of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 × 100 Hz, duration 1 s, 30 s apart) to induce LA-LTP in most cases. 

Although such experiments were not performed until now in the CA1 region the TBS protocol seems to be suited to apply in this experiment on the basis of the laminated structure of the CA1 region. 

Therefore, we decided to apply HFS in the LA and TBS in the CA1 region after induction of LTD to maximize the potentiation levels and enhance the chance to detect differences between the groups. 

That mGluR-GABA interactions were not explored in current studies might limit the applicability of the proposed mechanism to in vivo or clinical conditions. 

The HFS paradigm was chosen because theta burst stimulation did not produce consistent and reliable induction of LA-LTP.

## 4.1 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala

### 4.1.1 CX3CR1 activation reduces the excitability of principal neurons in the rat BLA

First, the intrinsic firing properties of principal cells, the most
numerous neurons in the BLA, were assessed through whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings, evoking action potentials in response to somatic
current injection.

The analysis revealed that following CX3CL1 treatment, the action
potential’s threshold was significantly more depolarized, as compared to
baseline (from -35.68 ± 1.38 to -33.28 ± 1.12 mV, n = 8, N = 5, t =
-2.96, df = 7, p = 0.021, paired t-test, see Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b). Hence, a higher
current injection is needed to induce neuronal firing, suggesting that
pyramidal-like neurons may be less excitable in the presence of CX3CL1.
As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>d1),
the gain (slope) remained unchanged (baseline = 0.04 ± 0.006,
CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.04 ± 0.006, see Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall1">7.1</a> and
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall2">7.2</a> in the Appendix
<a href="#CX3CL1membraneappendix">7.1.1.1</a>).

Similar effects were observed in higher dose (baseline = -36.72 ± 0.96,
CX3CL1(5nM) = -34.21 ± 1.12 mV, n = 14, N = 6, t = -5.08, df = 13, p =
0.0002, paired t-test, see Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b). The two approaches
were used to confirm whether CX3CL1-induced reduction in excitability is
dependent on the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1. First, before recordings, a
subset of slices was incubated with antibodies against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml).
Under such experimental conditions, the CX3CL1-induced reduction in
principal cells’ excitability was not statistically significant;
however, there still was a proportion of neurons responding with an
increased action potential threshold (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b). Notably, slices used
in this study were 300 μm thin, and the antibody penetration was limited
to (∼ 50 μ, Fogarty *et al.* (2013)). To this end, another subset of
experiments was performed using a pharmacological approach with AZD8797
to inhibit CX3CR1 (Ridderstad Wollberg *et al.*, 2014).

As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>,
AZD8797 prevented the CX3CL1-induced decrease in principal cells’
excitability, manifested as an increased action potential threshold, and
thereby additionally confirmed CX3CR1 mediation in the observed effect
(t = -0.61, df = 5, p = 0.568, paired t-test, n = 6, N = 5).

Of note, AZD9787 did not affect this parameter when applied alone (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd">4.2</a>a, baseline in DMSO =
-43.02 ± 1.4, AZD8797(10μM) = -44.18 ± 1.29 mV, n = 8, N = 8, t = 2.07,
df = 7, p = 0.077, paired t-test).

Since it is well-known that the CX3CR1 receptor is mostly expressed on
microglia, next, the possible involvement of this type of glial cells in
mediating CX3CL1-induced reduction of PCs excitability was
investigated.<!-- citations--> For this reason, the slices were
pretreated with 100μM minocycline, a tetracycline-like antibiotic known
to inhibit microglial activation, before and during CX3CL1 application.
As presented in Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>,
the inhibition of microglial activity also diminished the
CX3CL1-triggered effect on the action potential threshold (t = -0.66, df
= 13, p = 0.522, paired t-test). In contrast, the minocycline applied
alone increased the excitability of PCs (baseline = -41.79 ± 0.95,
minocycline (100μM) = -43.97 ± 1.67 mV, n = 9, N = 5, t = 2.55, df = 8,
p = 0.034, paired t-test, Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd">4.2</a>). Thus, this finding
highlights the potential importance of microglial functions in
regulating the activity of neurons in the BLA.

Finally, since it is increasingly evident that a heterogeneous group of
interneurons tightly controls the activity of principal cells in the BLA
(see Introduction <a href="#BLA">1.2.1</a>), it was investigated whether
blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors would eliminate
this depressing effect on PCs’ firing by CX3CL1.<!--dawki.--> For this
reason, recordings were made with the additional presence of the
picrotoxin (100μM) and CGP52432 (10μM), respectively. As expected, the
CX3CL1 effect was fully abolished when the GABA<sub>A</sub> and
GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were blocked (baseline = -39.47 ± 1.28,
CX3CL1 (2nM) = -38.99 ± 2.22 mV, n = 9, N = 4, t = -0.32, df = 8, p =
0.754, paired t-test, Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b). Thus, these data
suggest that CX3CL1 reduced principal cells’ firing *via* a CX3CR1-,
microglia-, and interneuron-dependent manner.<!-- cooperate?-->

### 4.1.2 Excitatory synaptic transmission is not significantly changed after the CX3CL1 application

Having established a significant CX3CL1-modulated suppression of
principal cells’ firing, the main group of glutamatergic neurons in the
BLA, the potential contribution of CX3CL1 on the modulation of the
excitatory transmission in this area was measured. Spontaneous
excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded *via* whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings (held at −70 mV).

All measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission before and
after applying CX3CL1, AZD8797, and minocycline are described in detail
in Appendix <a href="#CX3CL1sEPSCappendix">7.1.1.2</a>, summarized in
Table 7.2, and illustrated in Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall">7.3</a>. Compared to the control,
CX3CL1 in both measured concentrations (2nM and 5nM) had a negligible
effect on the median value of the amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of
sEPSCs. However, although statistically not significant, a proportion of
neurons (∼ 50%) reacted with a decreased frequency of excitatory
synaptic currents (Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC">4.3</a>a).

Furthermore, in addition to upregulated excitability, minocycline alone
also altered sEPSC kinetics by increasing both their rise time from 0.51
± 0.05 to 0.56 ± 0.05 ms, n = 9, N = 5, t = -3.33, df = 8, p = 0.01,
paired t-test) and decay time from 8.23 ± 0.16 to 8.53 ± 0.23 ms, n = 9,
N = 5, t = -2.71, df = 8, p = 0.027, paired t-test)(Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC">4.3</a>b1-b3). Thus, these observations
suggest that microglia may be one of the key contributors regulating
excitatory drive in the
BLA.<!-- Our findings overall highlight microglia and its receptor CX3CR1 as key contributors in regulation of social behavioral adaptation to chronic stress.-->

### 4.1.3 CX3CL1 decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission

These results revealed that the CX3CL1-induced downregulation of
principal cells’ excitability was also associated with GABA<sub>A</sub>
and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>). This is in line
with mounting evidence pointing to local interneurons as key regulators
of the activity of pyramidal-like neurons (see Introduction
<a href="#BLA">1.2.1</a>). Hence, the possible influence of CX3CL1 on
the inhibitory transmission onto BLA PCs was next explored in *in vitro*
slices. Cells were clamped at 0 mV to record sIPSCs. The representative
traces of sIPSCs in the absence (baseline) and presence of CX3CL1 (2 and
5nM) are shown in Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>. At 2nM,
CX3CL1 was ineffective in changing any of the sIPSCs measured parameters
(for details, see Appendix <a href="#CX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.1.1.3</a>),
whereas higher concentration (5nM) of CX3CL1 robustly<!--markedly-->
reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA by
decreasing the median frequency from 5 ± 0.415 to 3.45 ± 0.627 Hz and
the median amplitude from 24.03 ± 2.358 to 20.93 ± 1.979 pA,
respectively, compared to the baseline. Further analysis of IPSCs
kinetics showed that the median rise times and decay
times<!--and mIPSCs--> remained unchanged (from 1.16 ± 0.094 to 1.18 ±
0.055 ms and from 27.47 ± 0.508 to 27.9 ± 0.514 ms, respectively), as
reported by data in Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSCappendixfig">7.4</a> in Appendix
<a href="#CX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.1.1.3</a>.

Similar to what was observed in experiments assessing PCs’ excitability,
this drastic reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission followed by
CX3CL1 treatment was eliminated by both AZD8797 and minocycline. In
particular, following CX3CL1(5nM) application, the presence of the
CX3CR1 inhibitor and the blocker of microglial activity resulted in the
1.24 ±1.07 % and 1.35 ± 0.96 % of the median frequency during baseline,
respectively. These findings indicate a functional involvement of CX3CR1
and microglia in the modulation of BLA GABAergic transmission
(Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>).

In addition, to determine if a decrease in sIPSC frequency by CX3CL1 was
due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice,
the TTX (500nM) was used to block neuronal firing. The mIPSC amplitude,
frequency, and kinetics were measured before and after the CX3CL1
treatment (clamped at 0 mV). No changes in these parameters were found
between baseline and CX3CL1-applied recordings (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>b and c, mIPSC frequency: t =
-0.79, df = 6, p = 0.459, paired t-test, mIPSC amplitude: t = -0.75, df
= 6, p = 0.484, paired t-test). Hence, data presented here suggest that
CX3CL1 reduces GABA release at the local BLA synapses, probably by
depression of the spontaneous firing of local interneurons. Moreover,
this inhibition of GABAergic transmission by 5nM CX3CL1 was mediated by
both CX3CR1 and microglia.

### 4.1.4 CX3CL1 impairs the long-term potentiation in the BLA

*Extracellular recordings and analysis were done by Bartosz Bobula, PhD,
from the Department of Physiology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish
Academy of Sciences*

Considering studies indicating CX3CL1 involvement in memory, along with
presented here depression of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA, the next
step was to gain insights into how CX3CL1 modulates the BLA network
activity. To this end, extracellular recordings were employed. The
amplitude of field potentials, short-term plasticity, and long-term
potentiation were assessed. At the beginning of each experiment, the I/O
curves were determined, as shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>a. No significant differences were
evident between the input–output curves of FPs recorded from the control
and CX3CL1-induced slices (<!--number of slices = uzupełnić-->F (3, 41)
= 0.4, P=0.75, ANOVA)<!--jaka? mixed? two-way?-->. It indicates that
CX3CL1 did not modulate the baseline excitatory activity in the BLA
under our experimental conditions. The paired-pulse ratio, a form of
short-term plasticity sensitive mainly to presynaptic changes (Stuart &
Redman, 1991), was also investigated.
<!-- jedno zdanie że external capsule input stimulation led to PPF in all experiments -->
PPR, a measure of short-term synaptic plasticity, is defined as the
ratio of the amplitude of the second response to that of the first,
which depends on the probability of vesicular release at the synapse.
This parameter also remained unaffected by CX3CL1 treatment
(<!--number of slices = uzupełnić,-->H= 3.930, p = 0.27, Kruskal-Wallis
test; see Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>b). Thus, the
unaffected PPR suggests a similar release probability of glutamate and,
therefore, a postsynaptic mechanism of CX3CL1 action.

Notably, upon application of Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), external
capsule-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated
in the control slices, but not in the slices treated with CX3CL1, as
revealed by a significant decrease measured by the comparison of average
potentiation before and after LTP induction (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt;
0.001, ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test<!--jaka?-->; see
Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>c). However, the additional
presence of AZD8797, CX3CR1 antagonist, did not fully abolish this
effect (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc
test). Together, these findings demonstrate an<!--specific--> impairment
of BLA synaptic plasticity to external capsule inputs after CX3CL1
treatment.<!-- of external capsule inputs to LA/BLA.--> Considering that
one of the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is changes in dendritic
spines morphology<!--inaczej to napisać-->, the next goal was to examine
whether CX3CL1 affects dendrites morphology in the amygdala.

### 4.1.5 CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are expressed in principal cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala

*The part regarding neuronal cultures was done by Izabela Figiel-Ożóg,
PhD and Prof. Jakub Włodarczyk from Laboratory of Cell Biophysics,
Nencki Institute, Warsaw.*

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) has been shown to
play a critical role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and emotional
learning mediated by the basolateral amygdala.<!--citation?--> This is
also a critical marker of principal cells in the BLA (McDonald *et al.*,
2002). Results presented in this dissertation showed that CX3CL1-induced
depression of principal cell’s excitability and the impairment in LTP in
the BLA, the immunohistochemistry used to examine the expression level
of the CX3CR1 in CAMKIIα-positive cells in the BLA. As illustrated in
Figure <a href="#fig:BLACX3CL1immunofig">4.6</a>, the CX3CR1 receptor
was present in 15.96±1.01 % of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA.

The results regarding CX3CR1 expression in neurons, especially principal
cells, were also confirmed in neuronal cultures of the amygdala. Hence,
although all of the electrophysiological effects of the CX3CL1 were
prevented by minocycline, the direct action of this chemokine on neurons
is also plausible. However, as shown in
Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>c1 and c2, 50% of
neurons were responsive when 2nM CX3CL1 was applied, while 5nM CX3CL1
affected a larger fraction of neurons, reaching 65%.
<!--Thus, the immunostaining data shows that CX3CR1 expression involves a much lower subset of principal cells, suggesting that probably this CX3CL1-decreased firing of those neurons is not exclusively induced by direct activation of a CX3CR1 receptor at their membrane.-->

## 4.2 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the central amygdala

Principal cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala send their
projections to the central nucleus (see: Introduction
<a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a>). However, the basolateral and central
complexes of the amygdala participate in different extended circuitries.
Hence, CX3CL1 may differentially regulate these networks. Thus, to gain
insight into the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the CeA circuitry, its
functional consequences in this area were examined.

### 4.2.1 Modulation of intrinsic membrane properties of CeL neurons by CX3CL1 in a cell-type-specific manner

The next step was to investigate whether reduced excitability of CX3CL1
in the BLA would affect the membrane properties of their main target,
i.e., GABAergic cells in the CeL.
<!-- razem z tym, że on sam też może mieć udział... --> To this end,
among others, electrophysiological features such as excitability, input
resistance, membrane time constant, and resting membrane potential were
measured (see: Methods <a href="#electroprotocols">3.2.2.1</a>).

In general, these experiments revealed that several membrane properties
in the CeL neurons were significantly modified by CX3CL1 (see Figs.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>). However, since CeL neurons
demonstrate mainly two types of electrophysiological firing patterns,
such as Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons (see: Introduction
<a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a> and Fig.
<a href="#fig:methodsBLACeAIVrep">3.4</a>b), these intrinsic parameters
were further analyzed based on these neuronal
subtypes.<!--divided?--><!-- odnośnik do góry i lepiej napisać// segregated those neurons according to their types.-->
Intriguingly, while LF cells remained unaffected (see Figs.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, right panels), most RS neurons
were responsive to the CX3CL1 treatment, which was reflected by robust
changes in their intrinsic properties (Figs.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, middle panels). Specifically,
similar to what was observed in the BLA, bath application of CX3CL1
(2nM) produced a <!--reversible-->decrease in the number of action
potentials evoked by a given current step, manifested as a decrease in
the gain (baseline = 0.12 ± 0.018, CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.07 ± 0.015, W = 71, p
= 0.013, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, see Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a>).<!--  We injected a series of depolarizing current steps to assess the number of action potentials-->
This effect was accompanied by a reduced input resistance (W = 69, p =
0.021, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) and membrane time constant (t =
3.18, df = 11, p = 0.009, paired t-test; Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, middle panel). Moreover, resting
membrane potentials of Regular-Spiking CeL neurons become more
depolarized in response to bath-applied 2nM CX3CL1, being -56.25 ± 2.75
at baseline and reaching -51.6 ± 2.392, t = -2.28, df = 11, p = 0.043,
paired t-test after CX3CL1 treatment (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a>a2).

AZD8797 alone did not significantly change any of those parameters (see
Fig. <a href="#fig:AZDCeAmembrappendix">7.6</a> in Appendix
<a href="#CX3CL1CeAmembrappendix">7.1.1.4</a>). All measured parameters
and statistics are summarized in Table 7.4.

Notably, similar to what was observed in the BLA, minocycline alone also
affected the excitability of CeL neurons, especially the Late-Firing
subtype (Fig. <a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAintrinsicmino">4.9</a>).
Specifically, treatment with 100 μM minocycline lowered the threshold
needed for inducing action potentials in both types of neurons (from
-35.64 ± 1.472 to -39.46 ± 2.234, t = 2.95, df = 6, p = 0.026, paired

### 4.2.2 Effects of CX3CL1 on synaptic transmission in the CeL

As CX3CL1 reduced excitability of both the glutamatergic BLA as well as
GABAergic CeL neurons, both the excitatory and inhibitory transmission
were investigated. Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, no
substantial changes were observed in RS and LF neurons. The detailed
data is shown in Appendix <a href="#CX3CL1CeAsEPSC">7.1.1.5</a>.

On the contrary, CX3CL1 application led to a reduction in GABAregic
synaptic transmission, manifested as decreased frequency of sIPSCs onto
Late-Firing neurons from1.66 ± 0.185 to 1.45 ± 0.186 Hz, n = 8, N = 6, t
= 2.45, df = 7, p = 0.044, paired t-test, Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>a1). This effect was abolished
when CX3CR1 and microglial activity were blocked by AZD8797 and
minocycline, respectively (t = 0.39, df = 5, p = 0.715, paired t-test
and t = 0.17, df = 7, p = 0.868, paired t-test). These observations
suggest a functional involvement of CX3CR1 and minocycline in the
modulation of CX3CL1-induced inhibition of GABAergic transmission onto
Late-Firing cells. To examine whether this effect was mediated by the
spontaneous firing of neurons in the slice, the set of experiments were
performed in the presence of TTX (see Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>)<!--part?-->. Although 60% of
Late-Firing cells reacted with reduction in miniature inhibitory
synaptic currents, the statistic did not reach the level of significance
(baseline in TTX: 0.65 ± 0.134, TTX + CX3CL1(2nM): 0.55 ± 0.092, n = 7,
N = 4, t = 1.2, df = 6, p = 0.277, paired t-test). All details about
statistics, number of cells, animals, as well as descriptive analysis
are summarized in Table 7.6 in Appendix
<a href="#CeACX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.1.1.6</a>.

In contrast, no significant effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission
onto CX3CL1-treated Regular-Spiking neurons was found, despite a trend
toward increased frequency (baseline: 1.31 ± 0.258, CX3CL1(2nM): 1.58 ±
0.308, n = 10, N = 8, t = -1.29, df = 9, p = 0.23, paired t-test, Fig.
<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>a1). The kinetics of sIPSC and
mIPSC remained unaffected, as shown in
Fig.<a href="#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfigappendix">7.8</a> in the Appendix
<a href="#CeACX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.1.1.6</a>.

<!--Neurons in both regions also make extensive local connections (McDonald, 1982; Sun and Cassell, 1993; Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998), with local glutamate excitation of CeL neurons evoking IPSCs in neighboring neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004).-->

## 4.3 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala

### 4.3.1 CXCL12 does not significantly modulate the electrophysiological actions in the BLA

To study whether BLA network can be regulated by CXCL12, whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings were obtained from principal
cells.<!--, measuring their excitability and intrinsic properties, as well as synaptic transmission.-->
The intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic transmission were
measured using analogous protocols as in the CX3CL1 study. As assessed
by gain and threshold current, no significant changes in basal
excitability were found at both CXCL12 concentrations (2nM and 5nM)
despite a trend toward increased excitability (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAintrinsic">4.11</a>a). This was especially true
for CXCL12 at 5nM concentration; however, a high level of variation is
observed (Fig. <a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAintrinsic">4.11</a>b). Further
research will be required to independently replicate these findings and
further investigate the mechanisms of this effect. Moreover, other
measured membrane intrinsic properties of principal cells were also
unaffected by CXCL12 treatment, as shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig:CXCl12BLAexcitabilityfigall">7.9</a> in Appendix
<a href="#BLACXCL12membrappend">7.1.2.1</a>).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

and injected depolarizing current steps
</p>

</div>

Similarly, to evaluate the potential contribution of the chemokine
CXCL12 in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission, the
frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs were analyzed. As shown in
Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>, at 2nM, the reduction in
the frequency of sEPSCs is observed in 3 out of 10 cells following
exogenous CXCL12 treatment, whereas this chemokine increased the
excitatory transmission onto 4 out of 10 neurons (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and b1). When all these
neurons are grouped together, there is no statistically significant
change in the frequency of sEPSCs (t = -0.58, df = 9, p = 0.578, paired
t-test). Similarly, when CXCL12 at a concentration of 5nM was
bath-applied, 30% of principal cells responded with decreased frequency
of sEPSCs, while the glutamatergic synaptic transmission was increased
onto 40% of neurons (Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and
b2, t = 0.28, df = 6, p = 0.79, paired t-test). These findings also need
further replication and investigation of the potential mechanisms
underlying opposite effects of CXCL12 on sEPSCs frequency.
<!--  indicating that additional opposite mechanisms were involved (although in three out of the ten neurons tested we still observed a decrease in the AP frequency)-->
The remaining data concerning excitatory synaptic transmission are
illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfigall">7.10</a> in
Appendix (<a href="#BLACXCL12sEPSCappend">7.1.2.2</a>).

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.13: **Effects of 2nM and 5nM CXCL12 on the frequency and decay
time of sIPSCs**
</p>

</div>

Finally, the ability of exogenous CXCL12 to mediate inhibitory synaptic
transmission was also assessed.
Although<!--similarly to excitatory transmission,--> none of the
measured sIPSCs’ parameters reached statistical significance, there is a
trend in the frequency. As shown in
Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsIPSCfreq">4.13</a>, at the concentration of
2nM, CXCL12 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto 41.6666667 % of
principal cells. In contrast, at 5nM, the 8 out of the 15 neurons showed
an increased frequency of sIPSCs. In addition, sIPSCs’ rise time is
trendily increased by both doses of CXCL12
(Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12BLAsIPSCfreq">4.13</a>b and d). However, this
multifaceted effect needs further replication and

## 4.4 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the central amygdala

<!-- As previous studies suggest the anxiogenic action of CXCL12, its function in the CeL, critical region in relation to anxiety, was explored.
In contrast to what was observed in the basolateral amygdala, CXCL12 exerts more prominent electrophysiological effects in the central nucleus of the amygdala.-->
<!--To explore the function of neuronally expressed CXCR4, we tested its ability to modulate the electrical activity of CeL neurons.-->

### 4.4.1 Enhanced excitability of CeL neurons following CXCL12 treatment

First, to investigate the potential involvement of CXCL12 in neuronal
activity in the CeL, the intrinsic firing properties of CeL neurons were
assessed through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, evoking action
potentials in response to somatic current
injections.<!--To evaluate the previously reported anxiety-like induced behavior triggered by CXCL12,-->
Data reported in Figure <a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a>
demonstrates that CXCL12, especially at a higher concentration (5nM),
enhanced CeL neurons’ excitability, measured as threshold current
required for the first action potential and gain(slope) as a function of
injected current and frequency of
firing.<!--lepiej napisać///input-output curve <!--statistics, albo gain albo coś...-->
As described earlier, two main electrophysiological types of CeL neurons
are Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons. Thus, further analysis
revealed that although this CXCL12-induced increased firing can be
observed in both types of cells (Fig.
<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a>, right panel), it is more prominent
and statistically significant in Late-Firing neurons, with threshold
current during baseline being -37.91 ± 1.955 and reaching -40.18 ± 2.095
after CXCL12(5nM) treatment, n = 10, N = 7, t = 4.06, df = 9, p = 0.003,
paired t-test). These effects were prevented, at least partially, by the
selective CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 (baseline in AMD3100: -39.5 ± 2.137,
CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 -41.94 ± 2.09, n = 8, N = 4, t = 1.59, df = 7, p
= 0.155, paired t-test). Of note, the application of AMD3100 alone led
to an opposite trend (from -41.86 ± 3.017 to -46.2 ± 5.304, n = 4, N =
4,t = 1.64, df = 3, p = 0.199, paired t-test,
Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a>, right panel). These findings
suggest that CXCR4 may be involved in the regulation of firing of
Late-Firing neurons and possibly its tonic activity in those cells.

Given that several studies documented the presence of CXCR4 in
astrocytes (Bezzi *et al.*, 2001; Bonavia *et al.*, 2003; Calì & Bezzi,
2010), it was investigated whether the blockade of these glial cells by
incubation in astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, would eliminate the
observed CXCL12-mediated increase in Late-Firing neurons excitability.
This effect was not abolished by astrocytic inactivation in an acute
brain slice (t = -1.85, df = 2, p = 0.205, paired t-test), raising the
possibility that CXCL12 might activate CXCR4 directly on Late-Firing
neurons, enhancing the excitability of these neurons. Notably, this
observation is based on a limited number of neurons (n = 3, N = 3) and,
therefore, this finding needs further
replication.<!-- XE991 also enhanced  the  excitability  of  the  cell,  i.e.  increased  the  number  of  APs  evoked  by  a  constant depolarizing current pulse, reduced their rate of adaptation, enhanced the afterdepolarization and promoted bursting. // There  were  no  clear  differences  in  the  passive  membrane properties in cells showing different degrees of spike frequency adaptation. These  measurements  have  therefore  been  lumped together. -->

In addition, despite CXCL12-induced enhancement in CeL neurons’
excitability, CXCL12 does not modulate any other membrane properties in
those neurons, indicating a rather presynaptic mechanism. Figures and
detailed descriptions can be found in Appendix
<a href="#CXCL12CeAmembr">7.1.2.4</a>. Together, these findings
illustrate that CXCL12 upregulated LF neurons’ excitability in the CeL
in a CXCR4-dependent and probably astrocytic-independent manner.

### 4.4.2 Complex actions of CXCL12 on excitatory synaptic transmission

As presented in this dissertation, enhancement of excitability of CeL
cells, mainly Late-Firing neurons, triggered by CXCL12 was not
accompanied by any other measured membrane parameters, such as the input
resistance (see Fig. <a href="#fig:CXCl12CeAmembrfigall1">7.12</a> in
Appendix <a href="#CXCL12CeAmembr">7.1.2.4</a>). Thus, it may be
speculated that rather than the involvement of any channel, this effect
is a result of upregulated glutamatergic activity onto CeL
neurons.<!--better written--> To test this hypothesis, spontaneous
excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated. When all CeL neurons
are grouped into one category, no differences in the frequency,
amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs are observed between baseline and
CXCL12 treatment (<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>, left panel).
CXCL12 also did not enhance the glutamatergic transmission onto
Late-Firing neurons (<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>, right
panel). Intriguingly, regarding excitatory synaptic transmission onto
Regular-Firing neurons, two opposing trends (decreased vs. increased
frequency of sEPSCs) were revealed depending on the concentration of
CXCL12 used (2nM vs. 5nM; see Fig.
(<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>a2)).<!--the concentration of 5nM follow different trends  a  trend  for opposing CXCL12 action based on different concentration was revealed // These two opposite effects (slowing vs. acceleration) were observed in a same neuron depending on the concentration of SDF-1 a used ( n ¼ 6, Fig. 4A), but some neurons presented either the slowing or the acceleration effect (Fig. 4C and D, left panels). Thus, we hypothesized that these dose-dependant effects were mediated through different mechanisms. CXCL12 often appears to have opposite effects on neuronal function depending on the concentration.-->
However, none of these effects reached statistical significance.
Nevertheless, several reports indicated the opposing effects of CXCL12
on neuronal function depending on the concentration, and thereby this
issue warrants further investigation. Several mechanisms for these
opposite effects are reviewed in Guyon & Nahon (2007). A detailed
summary of measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission,
together with Figure <a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSCappen">7.14</a>
illustrating the amplitude and kinetics of sEPSCs after CXCL12 treatment
can be found in Table 7.11 in Appendix
<a href="#CXCL12CeAsEPSCappend">7.1.2.5</a>.

### 4.4.3 CXCL12 modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala

Considering that CeL neurons are mostly GABAergic and highly
interconnected (see Introduction <a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a>),
CXCL12-triggered enhancement in their excitability may thereby impact
the inhibitory synaptic transmission. To test this hypothesis, the
frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sIPSCs were recorded using
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. As expected, the application of
CXCL12 on brain slices significantly changed the frequency and amplitude
of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission (Figs.
<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a> and
<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCLF">4.17</a>). Analysis, which divided cells
into two subgroups based on their electrophysiological types, revealed
that CXCL12 at the concentration of 5nM differentially regulated
inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CeL.

Specifically, CXCL12 enhanced the GABAergic transmission onto
Regular-Spiking neurons, as manifested by increased frequency of sIPSCs
from 0.52 ± 0.132 to 0.66 ± 0.146 Hz (n = 9, N = 7, t = -2.73, df = 8, p
= 0.026, paired t-test, Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>a1),
without any changes in the amplitude (baseline: 15.17 ± 1.467 pA,
CXCL12(5nM): 13.7 ± 0.73 pA, t = -2.73, df = 8, p = 0.026, paired t-test
Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>a2). To confirm that the
CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, is responsible for modulation of GABAergic
transmission in RS neurons, the CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, was
employed. As expected, AMD3100 eliminated the CXCL12-induced increase in
the frequency of sIPSC, with 0.59 ± 0.119 in baseline and 0.52 ± 0.107
after CXCL12 treatment (t = 1.13, df = 7, p = 0.296, paired t-test, n =
8, N = 5,
Fig.<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b2).<!-- czy na pewno poprawnie?-->
Since CXCR4 is well-known to be functionally expressed on
astrocytes<!--citation?-->, the possible involvement of astrocytes in
mediating CXCL12-induced enhancement of GABAergic transmission onto
Regular-Spiking neurons was investigated. For this reason, prior to
CXCL12 treatment, the brain slices were pretreated with fluorocitrate, a
toxin known to inhibit astrocytic metabolism. As shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b3, fluorocitrate prevented the
CXCL12-triggered increase in the frequency of sIPSCs
(<!-- % of baseline? -->t = 2.08, df = 6, p = 0.083, paired t-test, n =
7, N = 5).

To determine whether there was a direct effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic
terminals, the mIPSCs were recorded. In these experiments, TTX was used
to block the action potentials. Under these conditions, the modulation
of GABAergic transmission by CXCL12 was partially abolished (mIPSC
frequency during baseline: 0.44 ± 0.08 vs. mIPSC frequency after CXCL12
treatment: 0.4 ± 0.112, t = 0.65, df = 5, p = 0.547, paired t-test, n =
6, N = 6, Fig. <a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b4).

Altogether, these results suggest that the CXCL12-triggered increase in
the frequency of sIPSCs was mediated through the stimulation of CXCR4
and probably associated with the increase in spontaneous firing of
interneurons, as this effect is eliminated by
TTX.<!--, as indicated by increased sIPSC frequency in pyramidal neurons-->
However, the inhibition of astrocytes by fluorocitrate was also shown to
eliminate the previously described effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic
transmission in Regular-Spiking neurons (see
<a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>).

In contrast, in Late-Firing neurons, CXCL12 significantly reduced the
sIPSC amplitude from 14.45 ± 0.86 to 12.5 ± 0.611 pA (t = 3.19, df = 12,
p = 0.008, paired t-test, ).<!-- nr of neurons, animals figure? --> This
chemokine also lowered the sIPSC frequency from 0.75 ± 0.161 to 0.48 ±
0.076 Hz (n = 13, N = 11, W = 75, p = 0.04, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank
Test, Figs. <a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCLF">4.17</a>a3 and b3). These
effects were eliminated in the presence of AMD3100, a CXCR4 blocker
(baseline amplitude in AMD3100: 13.06 ± 0.536 pA, amplitude after
CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 13.21 ± 0.69 pA, t = -0.36, df = 12, p = 0.723,
paired t-test, and baseline frequency in AMD3100 0.52 ± 0.142 Hz
vs. frequency after CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 0.59 ± 0.131 Hz, n = 13, N =
7, W = 41, p = 0.787, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test). Moreover, the
CXCL12-induced reduction in the both frequency and amplitude of sIPSC
were also blocked by the astrocytic toxin, flurocitrate (baseline in
flurocitrate: 15.15 ± 1.884 pA, CXCL12(5nM) in fluorocitrate: 14.2 ±
0.939 pA, t = 0.87, df = 3, p = 0.449, paired t-test, and baseline
frequency in fluorocitrate 15.15 ± 0.061 Hz, CXCL12(5nM) in
fluorocitrate: 0.62 ± 0.08 Hz, n = 4, N = 3, t = 1.16, df = 3, p =
0.332, paired t-test).<!--ładniej--> Finally, to determine if decreased
sIPSC frequency and amplitude by CXCL12 in Late-Firing cells were due to
a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, TTX
was used to block neuronal firing, and the mIPSC parameters were
measured before and after the CXCL12 application. CXCL12 was ineffective
to modulate both the frequency (t = -0.39, df = 6, p = 0.707, paired
t-test) and amplitude (n = 7, N = 6, t = -1.35, df = 6, p = 0.225,
paired t-test) of mIPSC.

Of note, further analysis of the IPSC kinetic parameters showed that the
median rise times and decay times of the sIPSCs and mIPSCs from both
Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons were unchanged after CXCL12
treatment (Figure <a href="#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCfigapp">7.15</a> in
Appendix <a href="#CXCL12CeAsIPSCappend">7.1.2.6</a>).

These findings collectively illustrate that the regulation of GABAergic
transmission by CXCL12 is cell-specific and dependent on spontaneous
neuronal activity and mediated *via* direct activation of CXCR4 and
astrocytes.<!-- These effects of SDF-1 were mediated *via* CXCR4 as they were abrogated by administration of a selective CXCR4 antagonist.-->

# 5 Discussion

Chemokines are a class of small immune proteins emerging as
neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication. Among
them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are particularly important in this regard, as
they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they were
shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, as well as the behavioral
level (Trettel *et al.*, 2020; Sowa & Tokarski, 2021). Moreover,
dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated
in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors (Yang *et
al.*, 2016; Schubert *et al.*, 2018). As their receptors, CXCR4 and
CX3CR1, are relatively densely present in the amygdala (Harrison *et
al.*, 1998; Banisadr *et al.*, 2002; Stumm *et al.*, 2002, 2003; Tarozzo
*et al.*, 2003), the critical region in the development of many
neuropsychiatric disorders (Mahan & Ressler, 2012; Duvarci & Pare, 2014;
Gilpin *et al.*, 2015), the electrophysiological consequences of their
activation were explored. Moreover, since distinct nuclei of the
amygdala play different roles in fear processing<!--lepiej napisać-->,
it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 affect
electrophysiological properties and synaptic transmission in those
regions. To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a
combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, the
actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two
nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA). Moreover,
considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication,
the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of
chemokine-modulated effects. Performing all electrophysiological
experiments using acute brain slices pretreated with microglial
inhibitor and astrocytic toxin allowed for dissecting local neuro-glial
cross-talk in these regions.

## 5.1 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

Findings of this study provide evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair
reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing
their threshold current, significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission
in this area, as well as impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA
synapses. These effects were mediated by the CX3CL1 only receptor,
CX3CR1, and probably by microglia. In addition, in primary neuronal
cultures from the amygdala, incubation with CX3CL1 induced an
immature-like phenotype of dendritic spines reflected as a decreased
ratio of dendritic head to length.

Principal cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are well-known to
converge information about both conditional and unconditional stimuli.
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory
synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing
behavior (for example, Nabavi *et al.* (2014)). Moreover, by combining
several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear
conditioning (CS+), Kim & Won (2017) found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were
explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific,
postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon. Accordingly, plasticity at
synapses onto principal cells in this region is considered to be a
candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and
storage of new fear memories (Blanchard & Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux *et
al.*, 1990; Tye *et al.*, 2008; Clem & Huganir, 2010; Johansen *et al.*,
2010). Hence, their activity is tightly regulated by a broad array of
factors, including a GABAergic system or different types of
neuromodulators (Prager *et al.* (2016) and references therein).

Here, the reduced excitability was demonstrated after the CX3CL1
application, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for
eliciting action potentials. Thus, the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the
principal cells’ firing may have significant consequences on BLA
physiology. To block this receptor, two approaches were used. Although
pre-incubating slices with an antibody against CX3CL1 abolished the
observed effect, a small portion of neurons still remained responsive to
CX3CL1. This may be due to the limited tissue penetration of antibodies,
estimated around 50μm, while slices used for this study were 300μm
thick. Thus another approach was used by employing the pharmacological
inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797. The effectiveness of AZD8797
molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures
(Lannes *et al.*, 2019) as well as *in vivo* administered both
intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) (Ho *et al.*, 2020) and
intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model (Chen *et al.*, 2020).
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10μ (Ridderstad
Wollberg *et al.*, 2014; Baxter *et al.*, 2021), was also effective in
experiments presented here. Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did
not affect any measured electrophysiological parameters. Thus, in the
remaining experiments, the 10μ was applied.

The presented CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP is consistent with
many previous studies showing CX3CL1-induced inhibition of LTP or
mimicking long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus (Bertollini *et
al.*, 2006; Ragozzino *et al.*, 2006; Maggi *et al.*, 2009; Sheridan *et
al.*, 2014), without affecting paired-pulse ratio (Bertollini *et al.*,
2006; Ragozzino *et al.*, 2006; Sheridan *et al.*, 2014). Consistently,
in this study, a CX3CL1-mediated increase in the threshold current was
observed, leading to a reduction of principal cells’ firing.

Many lines of evidence show neuroprotective and beneficial actions of
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling. For instance, the expression of CX3CL1 is
upregulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission,
such as after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus or ischemia, where
it is consistently shown to reduce neurotoxicity (Tong *et al.*, 2000;
Tarozzo *et al.*, 2002; Limatola *et al.*, 2005; Cipriani *et al.*,
2011; Yeo *et al.*, 2011). Its beneficial actions were also reported in
neurodegenerative models, where it was shown to rescue motor
coordination (Morganti *et al.*, 2012) or reduce Tau-pathology (Finneran
& Nash, 2019). Moreover, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to
reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate
currents with a mechanism that involves increased intracellular calcium
and dephosphorylation of the GluR1
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)
subunit (Meucci *et al.*, 1998; Limatola *et al.*, 2005; Ragozzino *et
al.*, 2006; Lauro *et al.*, 2008), a hallmark of the LTD. Thus, this
predominantly inhibitory role is suggested to be a component of
neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal
memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini *et al.*,
2006; Piccinin *et al.*, 2010; Sheridan *et al.*, 2014). Importantly, in
the BLA, many disorders are linked with the increased excitability of
pyramidal-like cells along with the elevated magnitude of LTP. Indeed,
blocking LTP with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, calcium channel
blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the
extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to
facilitate extinction (Falls *et al.*, 1992; Walker & Davis, 2002; Yang
& Lu, 2005; Sotres-Bayon *et al.*,
2007).<!--nowsze cytowania--><!-- więcej zaburzeń --> Therefore,
considering its well-documented neuroprotective role in other brain
structures, the reduced activity of PCs along with impaired LTP in the
BLA may suggest the anxiolytic actions of CX3CL1.

Unlike what is observed in the hippocampus, this study did not find any
effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA by
CX3CL1.<!--jakoś lepiej to napisać?--> These regional differences
between hippocampus and amygdala may be linked to the fact that CX3CL1
does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission in the
hippocampus, but rather its action is mediated by adenosine, released
from microglia upon CX3CR1 receptor activation (Lauro *et al.*, 2008,
2010; Piccinin *et al.*, 2010). As mentioned in the Introduction (see
<a href="#chemointheCNS">1.1.3</a>), depending on the adenosinergic
receptor activation, adenosine exerts opposing action and tonic activity
on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus (Piccinin *et al.*,
2010). Specifically, further evidence indicated that CX3CL1-induced
adenosine action *via* A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>3</sub>R receptor led to
decreased glutamatergic transmission Lauro *et al.* (2010), whereas
A<sub>2A</sub>R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as
CX3CL1-triggered increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC), observed when the
A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors are blocked (Piccinin *et
al.*, 2010). Moreover, Scianni *et al.* (2013) demonstrated that CX3CL1
NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(NMDA-fEPSPs) elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum by releasing D-serine
from glial cells and adenosine, which in turn modulate NMDAR and the
A<sub>2A</sub>R
subtype.<!-- NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs)  elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum-->
Thus, these findings raise the possibility that CX3CL1 also induces the
release of adenosine in the BLA, which in turn, is a downstream molecule
of the observed electrophysiological effects. Consistent with this idea,
both A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R receptors were documented to
modulate the excitatory AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission and LTP (Rau
*et al.*, 2014, 2015; Simões *et al.*, 2016), as it was observed in the
hippocampus (Mendonça & Ribeiro, 1994; Maggi *et al.*, 2009; Costenla
*et al.*,
2011).<!-- These findings are suggestive of the possible mediation of CX3CL1-induced effects by adenosine. // A1R activation inhibits spontaneous and evoked AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission,13 while A2AR increase the firing rate of BLA pyramidal neurons14 and facilitate long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) of LA population spikes, evoked by stimulating external mainly cortical afferents.15-->
Importantly, while the study documented the activation of
A<sub>2A</sub>R elevated the amplitude of NMDA currents in the
hippocampus (Dias *et al.*, 2012), decreased NMDA-EPSCs were observed
following the bath-application of A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists in the
amygdala (Pliássova *et al.*, 2020). This opposing action of adenosine
between these two regions on the excitatory synaptic transmission might
account for the differences in glutamatergic currents observed in the
present study after CX3CL1 treatment.

Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on
excitatory synaptic transmission possibly depends upon the relative
contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells
in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local
interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?--> As mentioned in the
Introduction, distal dendrites of principal neurons receive high levels
of excitatory synaptic inputs from both outside and within the BLA
(Brinley-Reed *et al.*, 1995; Farb & LeDoux, 1997; Farb & Ledoux, 1999).
This subcellular domain is also the target of local
somatostatin-positive interneurons (Muller *et al.*, 2007). Thus,
SOM-expressing neurons may influence how EPSPs travel along the
dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances. As
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study were made from the soma,
and the potassium-based intrapipette solution was used, excitatory
synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites needed to
travel more distance, and therefore, could be decreased by GABAergic
synapses. Hence, they might not be detected from baseline noise. Noting
that cesium blocks potassium currents, additional experiments using
cesium-based intrapipette solution might resolve whether CX3CL1 mediate
changes contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites (Williams &
Mitchell, 2008).

In addition, the lack of changes in the paired-pulse ratio of field
EPSP, together with inconclusive changes in the frequency of sEPSC,
implies postsynaptic actions of CX3CL1. Intriguingly, the suppression of
principal cells’ firing was not associated with any significant changes
in passive membrane properties, such as input
resistance.<!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->
The action potentials result from a dynamic interplay between not only
the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron but also
their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. As present data
reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of
pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic
transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated
reduction of pyramidal-like neurons’ firing is the regulation by a
GABAergic inhibitory system. Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission
within the CNS is mediated by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, a
heteropentameric chloride permeable, GABA-gated member of ligand-gated
ion channels, whereas slow inhibitory synaptic transmission is
associated with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor.<!--więcej o nich--> Indeed,
in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor
blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432, CX3CL1 failed to depolarize threshold
current, illustrating that those receptors were involved in this effect.
However, one would expect that reduced principal cells’ firing is a
consequence of increased inhibition onto those
cells.<!--lepiej napisać // --> In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the
GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA, reflected as
decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. Because spontaneous
synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive)
synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX
sensitive) (Doze *et al.*, 1991; Bellingham & Berger, 1996), sIPSC
frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release
probability and presynaptic
activity.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015 , and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses-->
Moreover, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects
alterations in postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas a change
in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of
GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses (De Koninck
& Mody, 1994; Otis *et al.*, 1994).<!--bardziej zmienić?--> Thus, a
reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1
treatment, which was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggests a
CX3CL1-mediated inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking and/or a
decreased reactivity or number of GABA<sub>A</sub> postsynaptic
receptors. Nevertheless, these results provide direct evidence that
CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission within the BLA, probably by
both presynaptic and postsynaptic
mechanisms.<!-- może silniej? direct evidence?--> These data are
consistent with findings in other brain regions such the dorsal raphe
nucleus, where CX3CL1 enhanced postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
number or sensitivity on serotonergic neurons (Heinisch & Kirby, 2009).
Similar action was reported in another electrophysiological study using
human tissue from epileptic patients. The epileptic tissue is
characterized by more pronounced desensitization of GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptors than healthy tissue, manifested as a decrease in
GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated currents following repetitive GABA
applications. However, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce this rundown in
pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients (Roseti *et
al.*, 2013), illustrating that this chemokine might stabilize
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor currents. Hence, both studies reported
CX3CL1-triggered modulation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors,
leading to increased sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to GABA inputs.
Importantly, one study also documented that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors
were involved in the CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP in the
dentate gyrus (Sheridan *et al.*, 2014). While CX3CL1 reduced the
magnitude of LTP in the DG, this phenomenon was abolished in the
presence of a GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker. All these findings, including
those presented in this dissertation, highlight that the actions of the
chemokine CX3CL1 may vary depending on the balance between excitation
and inhibition in the neuronal network. Thus, at least in the
hippocampus, the CX3CL1 neuroprotective inhibition of glutamatergic
drive is thought to be present during periods of enhanced excitatory
transmission and intact GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity (Sheridan *et
al.*, 2014).

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of
GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of
pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at
the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment of principal cells
due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action
potentials, triggered by, for example, changing the action potential
threshold (Hájos (2021), Tremblay *et al.* (2016) and references
within).<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. // plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AACs can control action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold, or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014). Accordingly,--><!-- zmienić i przeczytać cytowania? -->
The only subpopulation of interneurons presently known to innervate the
AIS are the chandelier cells, also known as AACs (Bazelot *et al.*,

Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs' spiking output and timing [@woodruff_2006].-->
Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin
(PV).<!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->
Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some AACs,
action potentials can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic
input (Szabadics *et al.*, 2006; Woodruff *et al.*, 2006; Spampanato *et
al.*, 2016).
<!--Whole-cell recordings from PV-expressing INs in ex vivo slices have shown that in some INs, action potential discharge can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input ( Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Woodruff et al., 2006 ).-->
This feedback excitatory input is disynaptic with a latency of ∼ 4 ms
and shows a dual pharmacological sensitivity to AMPA and
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists (Woodruff *et al.*, 2006), similar
to synaptic bursts during oscillations (Perumal & Sah,
2021).<!-- co to?--><!-- zmienić ...

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by Saha *et al.* (2016) has
shown that specific reduction of a pool of GABAergic synapses
innervating the AIS of BLA projection neurons resulted in similar
effects observed after acute CX3CL1 application. Specifically,
elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in
GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as
well as impaired LTP. What is more, the decreased excitability of
principal cells was associated with increased threshold potential, while
the input resistance was unaltered (Zonta *et al.*, 2011; Saha *et al.*,
2016). In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to
regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons
through their GABAergic inputs, through changing the action potential
threshold (Somogyi *et al.*, 1982; Douglas & Martin, 1990; Veres *et
al.*, 2014; Wefelmeyer *et al.*,
2015).<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).-->
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 likely impaired the
signaling of this PV-positive specific subtype of interneurons onto BLA
projection neurons, leading to the observed increased threshold
current.<!-- CX3CL1 likely perturbed the signaling of this specific set of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons. --><!--Following CX3CL1 treatment, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, whereas the input resistance was unaltered. trochę zmienić i zobaczyć czy pisać o action potential hal-width...--><!--The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et al (2011). zmienić i nie rozumiem jak to się ma do całości...--><!-- przeczytać to... // Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF knockdown arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).-->
In support of this supposition, microglia, the main cell type expressing
CX3CR1 receptors in the CNS, were reported to displace the inhibitory
synapses at AIS in the cortex (Chen *et al.*, 2014).

<!-- Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). -->

At the network level, while impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA
pathway after CX3CL1 application in the BLA is consistent with
CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells’ excitability, its relation
to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first
sight. However, mounting evidence indicates that different BLA
projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons (McDonald *et
al.*, 2011; Unal *et al.*, 2014), thus enabling input-specific
modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the
induction of LTP in this structure. Similar to the cellular level, the
chandelier PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation is a good candidate
for observed CX3CL1-mediated actions in the BLA. For instance, it may be
related to previous studies suggesting rather excitatory network effects
of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA
(Woodruff *et al.*,
2010).<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej -->
Following this idea, CX3CL1 could inhibit those cells, leading to an
observed reduction in the BLA network. In line with this hypothesis,
TNFα and IL-1β, other immune proteins displaying neuromodulatory
activity, downstream molecules of CX3CL1 actions in the hippocampus
(Rogers *et al.*, 2011), were demonstrated to affect specifically
PV-expressing neurons in the striatum (Rossi *et al.*, 2011). It led to
disturbance of network homeostasis manifested as a reduction in
GABAergic transmission and abnormal neuronal firing. Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate that CX3CL1, probably acting *via* TNFα- and/or
IL-1β-dependent mechanisms, might regulate the activity of PV-expressing
interneurons, and thus affecting the excitability of PCs.

Moreover, the external capsule contains mainly cortical fibers (Mahanty
& Sah, 1999).<!-- inputs from cortex--> Besides targeting principal
cells, monosynaptic connections from the cortex recruit local
interneurons *via* feed-forward circuits (Hübner *et al.*, 2014; Bazelot

In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections
with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits
(Veres *et al.*, 2014). Accordingly, both types of network mechanisms
might be involved when stimulating the external
capsule.<!-- this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar local inhibitory networks.-->

Of note, during fear conditioning, conditioned stimuli (CS) were
reported to activate PV-expressing interneurons, which in turn inhibited
SOM-positive interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of PCs dendrites
and the subsequent facilitation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity
(Wolff *et al.*, 2014). Hence, considering the hypothesis that CX3CL1
specifically acts on chandelier cells in the BLA, it is tempting to
speculate that the inhibition of the activity of PV subpopulation in the
BLA could prevent this disinhibition, leading to the observed impaired
long-term potentiation.<!--poprawić-->

Brain homeostasis is possible due to maintaining a finely tuned balance
between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neuronal
networks.<!--Finely tuned balance of The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. -->
Consistently, disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the BLA causes a

neurobiological diseases, such as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or
epilepsy (for a comprehensive review: Prager *et al.*

It can occur *via* a loss of local GABAergic interneurons, an alteration
in GABA<sub>A</sub>receptor activation, which leads to a dysregulation
of mechanisms that modulate BLA GABAergic
inhibition.<!--Disruption in GABAergic inhibition in the BLA can occur when there is a loss of local GABAergic interneurons, an alteration in GABA~A~receptor activation, or a dysregulation of mechanisms that modulate BLA GABAergic inhibition. from review @prager_2016-->
Hence, the GABAergic inhibitory system is the main target of therapeutic
treatments to reduce anxiety or seizures and maintain
homeostasis.<!-- zmienić // the GABAergic inhibitory system is one target of therapeutic treatments to reduce anxiety and maintain homeostasis.-->
For example, benzodiazepines, which allosterically enhance postsynaptic
actions of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, are an early treatment for
anxiety and seizure disorders (Farb & Ratner, 2014). Noting that various
GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal
cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, a better
understanding of their specialized roles is of high importance.

The previously reported the CX3CL1 modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptors in epileptic tissue (Yeo *et al.*, 2011; Roseti *et al.*,
2013), together with increasing evidence of its regulation of
excitatory/inhibitory circuits balance (Sheridan *et al.* (2014), and
this study), strongly suggest this molecule as a potential candidate for
altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy.
<!--Various chemokines and their receptors are increased in both parenchymal brain cells and leukocytes in human and experimental epilepsy (Cerri et al., 2017; de Vries et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2018).

## 5.2 CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

In the present study, the CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulation in the CeL
circuit was identified. The application of CX3CL1 on brain slices
containing the amygdala resulted in cell-specific changes in the
excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons, accompanied by affected
membrane properties, while membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons
were mainly unaffected in response to CX3CL1. These changes were
accompanied by the modulation of GABAergic transmission by CX3CL1.

As mentioned in the Introduction (see <a href="#CeA">1.2.3</a>), the
activation of SOM-positive neurons is anxiogenic, as they inhibit
PKCδ-expressing, thereby disinhibiting CeM (Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010).
Given that Regular-Spiking neurons correspond to 60% of SOM-positive
cells, the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduced excitability of RS cells
could prevent CeM disinhibition.
<!--Hence, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 exerts anxiolytic-like action in the CeL by acting on SOM-expressing neurons. NA ODWRÓT!!!!!!!! PRZECIEŻ CX3CL1 hamuje....-->
However, unlike what was observed in the BLA, the reduction of the
neuronal firing of Regular-Spiking neurons was manifested not by changes
in the threshold current but by a decrease in the overall number of
spikes to injections of increasing depolarizing
currents.<!-- brzydkie zdanie --><!-- This kind of specificity - other chemokines too - and cx3cl1 - serotonin. rozwinąć // Importantly, this CX3CL1-mediated firing depression was specific to Regular-Spiking neurons, as it was absent in the Late-Firing cells. /// -->
Consistently, in addition to excitability, other membrane properties
were altered after CX3CL1 acute treatment. Specifically, Regular-Spiking
neurons were more depolarized, while their input resistance and time
membrane constant were significantly reduced, suggesting the opening of
ionic channels. The observed depolarization of neurons during reduced
firing may seem counterintuitive at first; however, this set of changes
resembles hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated
channel (HCN) activation, a type of peculiar potassium channels
mediating I<sub>h</sub> currents (for a review: Combe & Gasparini
(2021); Kase & Imoto (2012)).<!-- lepiej --> Consistent with this
speculation, CeA neurons express HCN channels, especially the HCN1

unexplored.<!-- // jakieś cytowania? However, it is speculative whether CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling may be connected to HCN1 modulation, bu scanty evidence is available so far.-->
To the best of my knowledge, although the chemokine modulation of
several types of channels was previously reported in many brain regions
(Puma *et al.*, 2001; Lax *et al.*, 2002; Oh *et al.*, 2002; Guyon,

from this study point to a previously unknown link between CX3CL1/CX3CR1
signaling and HCN channels.

I<sub>h</sub> currents impact several aspects of neural and network
activity. Specifically, they can depolarize membrane potentials,

*et al.*, 2020), further investigations are warranted to better
characterize the I<sub>h</sub> activation and inhibition in CeL circuit,

In contrast to Regular-Spiking neurons, membrane properties of
Late-Firing neurons were unaffected by exogenous CX3CL1. On the other
hand, this chemokine reduced GABAergic synaptic transmission
specifically onto those neurons, which was reflected as a decrease in
both the median amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs. It should be noted
that CeL neurons are densely interconnected and they form more synapses
between different neuronal subtypes (RS↔LF) than those between the same
subpopulation (RS↔RS and LF↔LF) (Hou *et al.*, 2016).
<!--Despite the fact that CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes. zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. --><!-- bardziej zmienić Intriguingly, presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell-type identities strongly dictate the efficacy and short-term plasticity (STP) of the CeL synapses [@hou_2016].Synapses formed by different classes of cells are strong and markedly depressing when activated at 20 Hz, whereas those between cells of the same class are weak and do not exhibit prominent facilitation or depression [@hou_2016]. <!-- zmienić --><!-- the efficacy of the ES ¡ LS or LS ¡ ES synapse was > 2-fold greater than that of the LS ¡ LS or ES ¡ ES synapse. /// density -->
This connectivity pattern supports the presented data. It can be
hypothesized that reducing the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons
would lead to the downregulated GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing
cells. Hence, Regular-Spiking neurons form more dense and potent
synapses onto local, different subpopulations of neurons, e.i.,
Late-Firing. Consistently, the CX3CL1-modulated reduction of GABAergic
transmission onto Late-Firing neurons should be more prominent than onto
Regular-Spiking cells.

Altogether, this study illustrated that CX3CL1 led to decreased activity
in both, pyramidal-like cells in the BLA as well as Regular-Spiking
neurons in the CeL. However, while principal cells displayed
CX3CL1-mediated elevated threshold current, in Regular-Spiking neurons
the lowered gain was observed.
<!-- these effects were a result of different parameters (decreased threshold current in the BLA vs. decreased number of spikes induced by increasing current injections.-->
Thus, probably different downstream events were involved. In line with
this, altered membrane properties of Regular-Spiking cells were observed
following CX3CL1 treatment. It might, therefore, be conceivable that
these membrane changes are associated with the direct activation of
CX3CR1 expressed in Regular-Spiking neurons. The possible candidate is
the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of HCN channels in Regular-Spiking cells.
On the contrary, in the BLA, no membrane changes were observed following
the CX3CL1 application. Considering the increased threshold current in
BLA PCs, the impaired LTP, and concomitant decreased frequency of
sIPSCs, the CX3CL1 effects on PV subpopulation of interneurons is
speculated. However, those hypotheses need to be further
verified.<!--PLA, single cell --> <!-- barwwienia --> If they are true,

## 5.3 Microglial action in the amygdala

When discussing potential mechanisms of neuromodulatory actions of the
CX3CL1, the controversy regarding the localization of its receptor,
CX3CR1, should be acknowledged. While some reports confine the
localization of CX3CR1 on microglia (Tarozzo *et al.*, 2003; Cardona *et
al.*, 2006), several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and
electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional
CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal,
and DRN neurons (Maciejewski-Lenoir *et al.*, 1999; Hatori *et al.*,
2002; Tarozzo *et al.*, 2003; Verge *et al.*, 2004; Limatola *et al.*,
2005; Zhuang *et al.*, 2007; Heinisch & Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya *et al.*,
2012, 2014; Sheridan *et al.*, 2014; Hughes & Nibbs,
2018).<!--+ nowsze--> Here, our immunohistological data from both brain
slices and cultured neurons also suggest that CX3CR1 is present on
neurons in the amygdala. Notably, the data presented here do not
conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons, and the
possibility that these electrophysiological effects happen as a
consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia
cannot be ruled out.

In the past decade, new research has emerged providing evidence and
insight into the functions of microglia. Briefly, those cells are
crucial in refining the neuronal network both under physiological and
pathological conditions either directly through physical contacts with
neurons, by releasing signaling molecules (Wake *et al.*, 2009; Tremblay
*et al.*, 2010)<!--jeszcze wydzielanie--> or indirectly *via*
interactions with astrocytes (Liddelow *et al.*, 2017). The
CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is believed to be a key component of the
microglia-neuron crosstalk due to its expression pattern (Harrison *et
al.*, 1998; Nishiyori *et al.*, 1998; Streit *et al.*, 2005; Szepesi *et
al.*,
2018).<!-- better written // One of the key elements in the microglia–neuron crosstalk, deeply linked to the synaptic refinement and modulation, is the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis.<!-- -->
Thus, most of these studies were done using the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in
mouse line, in which the CX3CR1 receptor gene has been replaced by a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (Jung *et al.*, 2000). Given
that only microglial cells were identified to express GFP in these mice,
all studies using this strain strengthen the notion of a
microglial-specific CX3CR1 expression. Nevertheless, microglia from
CX3CR1-deprived mice show decreased microglial branching and altered
motility (Basilico *et al.*, 2019).<!--więcej? --> Moreover, the lack of
CX3CR1 in knockout mice was shown to alter synaptic transmission
(Basilico *et al.*, 2019)<!--więcej-->, plasticity (Maggi *et al.*,
2009, 2011; Rogers *et al.*, 2011), brain connectivity (Zhan *et al.*,
2014), and behavior (Rogers *et al.*, 2011; Zhan *et al.*, 2014;
Schubert *et al.*, 2018; Piirainen *et al.*,
2021).<!-- highlighting ? --><!--zmienić drugą część zdania....  Indeed, the disruption of this neuron–microglia signaling causes several alterations in brain connectivity [22] and cognitive functions [23] associated with an impairment in glutamatergic synaptic transmission [22–26].  These effects have been generally ascribed to the roles exerted by microglia during brain development, due to the <!-- are crucial the maintenance of brain homeostasis during development and adulthood, and--><!-- modulating astrocytic beneficial or detrimental activity // several alterations in brain connectivity [22] and cognitive functions [23] associated with an impairment in glutamatergic synaptic transmission [22–26].-->

Therefore, to identify the involvement of microglia in CX3CL1-mediated
neuromodulatory effects observed in this study, a subset of slices was
pre-applied with minocycline, which is commonly used to inhibit
microglial activation, including in electrophysiological studies (for
example: Scianni *et al.* (2013)).

The CX3CL1-mediated downregulation of GABAergic transmission and
elevated threshold current in principal cells in the BLA were not
observed when minocycline was pre-applied, suggesting that microglia may
be involved in this
process.<!-- However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig <a href="#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall">7.3</a> in Appendix <a href="#CX3CL1sEPSCappendix">7.1.1.2</a>).-->
Interestingly, minocycline applied alone was shown to facilitate
principal cells’ firing and affect the kinetics of excitatory synaptic
transmission in the BLA. A similar situation was observed in CeL, where
Late-Firing neurons were more excitable following minocycline
incubation. <!-- These unexpected findings ....  --> Moreover, when both
minocycline and CX3CL1 were present, neither the CX3CL1- nor the
minocycline-mediated effects were observed, suggesting opposing actions

This idea is further supported by a recent study by Yuan *et al.*
(2020), in which they inhibited or activated microglia by infusion into
CeA either minocycline or CX3CL1, respectively, and exerted opposite
effects on visceral
hypersensitivity.<!-- WAS-induced changes in microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in the CeA, and visceral hypersensitivity were reversed by minocycline whereas in stress-naïve rats, fractalkine induced microglial deramification and visceral hypersensitivity.--><!--dodatkowo : PKCdelta - enkefalin - pain -->
However, it should be mentioned that minocycline is a tetracycline
antibiotic that has powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and
antioxidant properties, which has some other unrelated effects,
including direct action on neurons. Thus, the findings presented in this
study do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons
or complete inhibition of microglial activity by minocycline. Therefore,
the possibility that the observed effects happen as a consequence of
CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia or/and direct
minocycline actions on neurons cannot be discounted.

It is worth noticing that CX3CL1 was bath-applied onto BLA neurons after
the minocycline-induced upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and
neuronal activity. Hence, CX3CL1 might eliminate this
minocycline-induced enhancement of glutamatergic drive, supporting the
hypothesis that CX3CL1 action depends on the initial state of the
network and restoring the disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance
(Bertollini *et al.*, 2006; Sheridan *et al.*,
2014).<!-- there is a possibility that the CX3CL1 treatment abolished prior minocycline-mediated elevated excitability of pyramidal-like neurons independently on CX3CR1 activation instead of elimination of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on neuronal firing by minocycline.-->
This idea is consistent with the observed complex actions of CX3CL1 on
the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA: CX3CL1 was shown to
decrease the frequency of sEPSC mainly onto BLA neurons with higher
frequency during baseline, especially at the concentration of 5nM. In
accordance to our data, studies from other group demonstrated the
TTX-sensitive modulation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synaptic
transmission by CX3CL1, supporting their actions at the network level
(Heinisch & Kirby, 2009). Finally, the potential role in maintaining the
E/I balance, along with a TTX-sensitive modulation of synaptic
transmission, was also proposed to other chemokines and cytokines,
including IL-1β and TNFα (Rossi *et al.*, 2011), suggesting a similar
action of immune proteins in the brain
physiology.<!-- (citations) --><!--In line with the hypothesis - homeostasis synaptic scaling - there is possibility that, regardless of the mechanism of minocycline-induced increase in PCs' excitability, the lack of observed effects when CX3CL1 is added to pre-applied minocycline is its "normalizing" action.CX3CL1 could decreased the previously elevated PCs' firing as well as kinetics of sEPSCThese issues findings are hard to interpret, especially when ....inspecific many explanations-->

<!-- Changed kinetics of sEPSC - was previously demonstrated in astrocytes when extrasynaptic AMPA receptors, too much glutamate -

<!-- zmienić
Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. 
Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). 
Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. 
Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->
<!--glial impact?
By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

For instance, minocycline inhibited Na+ currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells ( Kim et al., 2011 ), suppressed Na+ and Ca2+ currents in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ), and reduced evoked synaptic currents ( Cho et al., 2006 ) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents ( Liu et al., 2015 ) in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons.

In addition, minocycline at 500 l M abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons ( Itoh et al., 2011 ).-->

To sum up, although the underlying cellular mechanisms and the possible
regulation of local neuron-glia communication in the amygdala is still
largely unknown, this study has shown that both CX3CL1 and minocycline
modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the
basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala.<!-- ładniej.... --->

microglial cells, especially microglia-neuron crosstalk, in the

## 5.4 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala

Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect
principal cells’ excitability, as well as excitatory and inhibitory
synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were observed. In
particular, presented results indicated that following CXCL12
nonsignificantly increased excitability of principal cells (especially
at a higher concentration), modulated the excitatory synaptic
transmission, and induced opposing changes in the frequency of sIPSCs
depending on the chemokine concentration.
<!-- The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is in line with a previous report demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus of the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a], at least considering sensitivity and the detection level needed for *in situ* hybridization 20 years ago. nienajlepsze zdanie-->

CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus
of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation (Yang *et al.*,
2016). Nevertheless, it demonstrated neuronal expression of the CXCR4
receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement of
the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA under physiological
conditions. The authors further suggested that the latter effect might
lead to the increased excitability of pyramidal-like
neurons.<!-- However, these results are in contrast with studies conducted by , revealing that CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.-->
Their hypothesis is supported by the results presented in this PhD
dissertation. However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic
transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward. In particular,
the study by Yang *et al.* (2016) revealed that the application of
CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by
increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA. In contrast, results presented
here showed that CXCL12(2nM) enhanced sEPSC frequency in 2 out of 12
neurons, while reducing this parameter in 5 out of 12 cells. Thus,
grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency
of sEPSCs. These neuronal proportions were also similar when a higher
concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied. Different
experimental settings may explain this discrepancy between studies.
First, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed by Yang *et
al.* (2016) in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using
slices obtained from male Wistar rats. The difference between those
animals was reported in many contexts (Asan *et al.*, 2005; Northcutt
*et al.*, 2007).<!-- lepiej napisać-->

Moreover, while the present study was performed on the coronal slices,
transverse slices containing the amygdala were used in the study by Yang
*et al.* (2016). Accordingly, the entorhinal, perirhinal cortex, the
hippocampus, and the amygdala are heavily interconnected and implicated
in memory; most of the connections known from *in vivo* studies were
preserved in the horizontal slices (Halbach & Albrecht, 2002). Given
that those connections are excitatory, it raises the possibility that
the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices might be,
at least in part, due to more preserved and dense connections between
those crucial structures, which were absent from coronal
slices.<!-- The present study increases our understanding of which hippocampal pathways are best preserved in the three most common brain slice preparations, and will help investigators determine the appropriate slices to use for physiological studies depending on the subregion of interest.-->
<!--The temperature, which is the critical factor for recording the synaptic transmission, also differs between these two studies.
Here, brain slices were submerged with the ACSF at the temperature of 31–33°C, whereas the excitatory synaptic transmission in experiments by @yang_2016 was recorded at room temperature.potwierdzenie-->

Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF,
Yang *et al.* (2016) sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a
blocker of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, picrotoxin. Therefore, these
findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory
synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in Yang *et
al.* (2016) study was distorted by the modulation of the GABAergic
heterogeneous group of local interneurons. Given the well-known tight
regulation of principal cell activity by local interneurons (for a
review: Hájos (2021)), along with documented CXCL12 mediation of
GABAergic transmission (for a review: Guyon (2014)), this explanation is
possible. <!-- jeszcze coś o excitability?--> Nevertheless, whether
blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors will result in a significant
CXCL12-mediated increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the
BLA and/or enhancing their firing in rat coronal acute slices needs
further studies.

In line with this hypothesis, there is a trend in the CXCL12-triggered
changes in the frequency of sIPSC, although not statistically
significant.<!--lepiej napisać--> Specifically, bath administration of
CXCL12 produced two distinct responses: while exogenous CXCL12 at the
concentration of 2nM was shown to reduce the frequency of sIPSC, the
increased number of these events were observed following treatment with
a higher concentration of this chemokine
(5nM).<!--bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically-->

These observations are in good agreement with what happens in MCH
neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA), where CXCL12 also exerts
opposite effects depending on the concentration used (Guyon, Banisadr,
*et al.*,
2005).<!-- nie wiem czy bardziej nie zmienić... This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the LHA, where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration ( Guyon et al., 2005a ).// SDF-1α often appears to have opposite effects on neuronal function depending on the concentration. For example, in DA neurons, at low concentrations, it acts as a neuromodulator by potentiating K+-induced DA secretion and HVA calcium currents, whereas at higher concentration, it decreases DA release and HVA calcium currents. This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, where SDF-1α also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration (Guyon et al. 2005b). Moreover, this can also be observed in other contexts, for example, low levels of SDF-1 (<100 ng/ml) are attractive, whereas higher levels (>1 μg/ml) are repulsive for T cells (Zlatopolskiy & Laurence 2001). Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, are reviewed in Fig. 3. -->
Specifically, CXCL12 at 0.1-1 nM decreased peak and discharge frequency
of action potential evoked by current pulses, whereas at the
concentration of 10nM, CXCL12 induced the opposite actions. Several
putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually
exclusive, have been proposed (Guyon & Nahon,
2007).<!-- Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, are reviewed in Guyon and Nahon (2007) . sprawdzić skąd to... -->

First, the characteristic U-shaped dose-dependent effect curve is
commonly displayed in signaling molecules, including
chemokines.<!-- chemokines usually display a U-shaped dose-dependent effect curve, suggesting opposing functions depending on their concentration. // może GPCR receptors?-->
Such a process, known as ‘hormesis,’ relates to adaptive responses to
compensate for disruption in homeostasis by overshooting homeostatic
feedback controls (for reviews: Mattson (2008) and Rostène, Dansereau,
*et al.* (2011)).

In addition, CXCL12 was shown to be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases
(MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment. This
metabolite was reported to exert its action independent of the CXCR4
receptor (Zhang *et al.*,
2003).<!--Indeed, it has been shown that CXCL12 can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment, namely CXCL12 a (5–67), that exerts its effect through a G-protein coupled receptor distinct from CXCR4 (Zhang et al ., 2003). sprawdzić skąd to... -->
Accordingly, the enhancement of sIPSC frequency observed at higher
concentrations of CXCL12 could be mediated by a CXCL12 metabolite
produced in the acute brain
slice.<!--These effects could overcome the CXCR4 effects.zmienić NA SZCZĘŚCIE NIE BLOKOWAŁAM TEGO :D-->
<!-- This may be due to concentration reached during inflammatory conditions, /// compensatory mechanism

Given that the upregulated GABAergic transmission in the BLA is
implicated in animal models of neuropsychiatric diseases, further
experiments using specific MPP inhibitors should clarify this point
(Guyon, Banisadr, *et al.*, 2005).<!--zmienić-->

Another possibility is that different concentrations might act on
different cell types. This mechanism was previously reported regarding a
different chemokine, CX3CL1, in the hippocampus (Sheridan *et al.*,
2014).<!-- sheridan - glia vs neurons different concentration However unlikely as yang_2016 did not detect the CXCR4 expression in the astrocyte. A MY?! Probably OR MAYBE MICROGLIA. /// The dif-ferential responses of CX3CL1 on neurons and non-neurons at thelower concentration (500 pM) may relate to variations in absolute levels of CX3CR1 receptor expression on distinct cell populationsin the hippocampus.-->
Notably, considering that no CXCR4-expressing astrocytes were observed
in the BLA (Yang *et al.*, 2016), together with the known expression of
CXCR4 in microglial cells (Tanabe *et al.*, 1997), it might be
conceivable that the concentration needed to activate CXCR4 on
microglial might be different from neuronal cells.

Moreover, in addition to CXCR4, CXCL12 is known to act through another
atypical receptor, ACKR3 (Levoye *et al.*, 2009). Recently, increasing
evidence has shown the ACKR3-modulated action of CXCL12 in many brain
structures (Puchert *et al.*, 2017; Fumagalli *et al.*, 2020; Meyrath
*et al.*, 2020).<!--rozwinąć ? including? --> Nevertheless, to date, no
ACKR3 has been detected in the amygdala (Schönemeier *et al.*, 2008),
suggesting that this explanation is unlikely.

Altogether, the subtle CXCL12-modulated changes on synaptic excitability
and excitatory synaptic transmission might be related to heterogenous
groups of principal cells and/or interneurons and/or by using coronal
slices which were mostly devoid of important hippocampal and coronal
inputs. Nevertheless, this study raises the possibility that CXCL12
might modulate the local inhibitory synaptic transmission in the BLA in
an opposing manner depending on the concentration used. This is similar
to what was observed in other structures and supports the notion that
CXCL12 might exert either a neuroprotective or neurotoxic role based on
its concentration.

## 5.5 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala

This dissertation provides new evidence for the neuromodulatory
properties of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in synaptic transmission and
membrane properties in the lateral subdivision of the central complex of
the amygdala. First, CXCL12 was shown to modulate the excitability of
CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably
without the astrocytic involvement. Moreover, the frequency of
excitatory synaptic currents was increased at the higher concentration
(5nM) only in the Regular-Spiking cells. Finally, the treatment with
CXCL12 also led to the opposite regulation of GABAergic transmission,
based on the subtype of CeL neurons, which was possibly influenced by
astrocytes.

CXCL12 was shown to increase the excitability of CeL neurons. While a
decreased threshold current was observed in both Late-Firing and
Regular-Spiking neurons, the Late-Firing neurons displayed additional
decreased gain.<!--i co to może znaczyć?--> Thus, as a response to
increasing depolarizing steps, after CXCL12 application, those neurons
were more excitable and needed smaller current injections but produced
fewer spikes during higher injections.<!--lepiej napisać --> The CXCR4
receptor contributed to the observed effects, as the presence of AMD3100
prevented the CXCL12-mediated enhancement in CeL neuronal excitability.

Interestingly, AMD3100 alone was shown an opposite trend, suggesting
tonic activity of CXCR4 in the CeL neurons. This phenomenon was
previously reported in granule neurons precursors in the DG by using
pharmacological, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological
approaches (Stumm *et al.*, 2002, 2003; Bhattacharyya *et al.*, 2008;
Kolodziej *et al.*,

CXCL12 is postnatally upregulated in mature granule neurons and pharmacological, immunohistochemical as well as electrophysiological approaches suggest that CXCR4 is tonically activated in granule neuron precursors by local CXCL12 (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Berger et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008; Kolodziej et al., 2008; Choe and Pleasure, 2012).-->
The own effects of AMD3100 when applied alone were also observed in MCH
neurons in the LHA (Eggermann *et al.*, 2003), where the CXCR4 was
suggested to be tonically inhibited, resulting in the hyperpolarized
membrane potential under basal
conditions<!--, as compared to CXCR4-derived orexin neurons in the LHA-->
(Eggermann *et al.*,
2003).<!-- Low concentrations of CXCL12 exert a tonic inhibition on MCH neurons, which are known to have a hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions, as compared to orexin neurons of the LHA which are in intrinsic state of membrane depolarization and lack CXCR4 expression (Eggermann et al., 2003). In addition, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 has its own effects when applied alone which suggests that a tonic activation of CXCR4 occurs, at least in slices preparations, and that low levels of CXCL12 are secreted under basal conditions (although the slice preparation could also be considered as an inflammatory state).[@guyon_2014]--><!--Given that tonic activation of CXCR4 by SDF1 leads to internalization of both chemokine and receptor (Burger and Kipps, 2006), it is entirely possible that the constitutive release of neuronal SDF1 and subsequent neuronal signaling via CXCR4 may result in diminished evidence of CXCR4-IR in the sensory ganglia of morphine treated rats (Fig. 6C). This event would not be unlike previous reports in the dentate gyrus (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008, Kolodziej et al., 2008).-->

Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.
In conclusion, the SDF-1 a -induced hyperpolarization is likely linked to the activation of a GIRK current via stimulation of CXCR4
-->

Moreover, the pre-incubation slices with an astrocytic toxin,
fluorocitrate, did not abolish the CXCL12-triggered increase in neuronal
excitability, suggesting that astrocytes did not mediate this effect.
This raises the possibility that similar to the BLA and the SN (Guyon
*et al.*, 2006; Yang *et al.*, 2016), astrocytes in the CeA might also
lack the CXCR4 receptors. However, further studies employing
immunostaining methods are necessary to verify this hypothesis.
<!--This is in line with presented immunofluorescence data demonstrating the absence of CXCR4 in astrocytes. pokazuje? ;/ -->

Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, a complex trend was
observed.
<!-- może tutaj zdanie o tym że działa na transmisję w innych strukturach? patrz niżej ale nie wiem jakie efekty -->
At 2nM, CXCL12 was shown to reduce the frequency of sEPSC onto more than
50% of Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the elevated frequency of sEPSC
was observed during 5nM CXCL12 treatment.<!--POPRAWIĆ--> Moreover, this
effect was prominent in Regular-Spiking neurons, while no relevant
differences in the excitatory synaptic transmission were observed onto
Late-Firing cells.
<!-- As documented previously, CXCL12 was revealed to increase glutamate release in the cerebellum and hypothalamus [@guyon_2005; @ragozzino_1998].-->
This is in line with a study showing that PVT neurons preferentially
innervated SOM-positive neurons in CeL (Penzo *et al.*, 2015), which is
in good agreement with the observed enhancement of excitatory
transmission onto Regular-Spiking
neurons.<!--poprawić i cytowanie // PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM+ neurons in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM+ neuron activity and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear learning and expression5,6-->
Since the higher concentration of CXCL12 showed a trend toward increased
excitability of principal cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate
that their elevated activity is reflected by upregulated excitatory
transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons. Although BLA direct
glutamatergic projections to CeL have been well-established (Krettek &
Price, 1978; Pitkänen *et al.*, 1997; Ciocchi *et al.*, 2010; Li *et
al.*, 2013), differences in the type of their target neurons remain
unclear.<!-- może nie unclear..... prefer Regular-Spiking or SOM-expressing neurons -->
However, given the anxiolytic effect of optogenetic stimulation of the
BLA→CeL pathway (Tye *et al.*, 2011), the cell type-specific differences
have been speculated (Fadok *et al.*,
2018).<!--Because optogenetic stimulation of the pathway between the BLA and CEl can also have anxiolytic effects [ 12 ], it could be that glutamatergic BLA inputs to the CEl target different cell types, and that depending on stimulation parameters, different behavioral responses could be induced-->
Of note, principal cells were reported to preferentially innervate
Late-Firing neurons in the baseline condition, whereas following
fear-conditioning, this pattern changes (Li *et al.*, 2013). Given that
intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 impaired the acquisition and
extinction of conditioned fear response (Shi *et al.*, 2016), we
speculate that CXCL12 might be involved in this process.

<!--relevance fear
BLA can influence CEm via direct glutamatergic projections9,10,11,16 and through indirect di-synaptic routes involving the glutamatergic excitation of GABAergic intercalated (ITC)16 or central lateral (CEl) neurons9,10,11 that project to CEm10,11,16,17.///
Specifically, fear conditioning strengthens excitatory synapses onto neurons expressing the peptide hormone somatostatin(SOM+)/PKCd  neurons, which largely correspond to CeLONunits, while weakening those synapsing onto SOM  /PKC d + neurons in the CeL, which largely correspond to CeLOFFunits.-->

<!-- Guyon_2006
Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12. However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12. 
It is therefore likely that CXCL12 induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). 
Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. 
The mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.-->

Since CeL neurons are highly interconnected, one could speculate that
the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Spiking cells
and elevated excitability would lead to more increased GABAergic
transmission within CeL.<!--lepiej napisać, ale tak --> In contrast, at
the concentration of 5nM, the median frequency of sIPSCs is increased in
the Regular-Spiking cells, whereas Late-Firing cells were shown to
display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. All of these
effects were mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in
the presence of AMD3100. In addition, these observations were also
absent in the presence of TTX and an astrocytic toxin. A similar dual
effect on GABAergic transmission in the CeL was described for another
immune protein, IL-1β (Bajo *et al.*, 2015). These observations suggest
that the CXCL12-mediated actions on GABAergic transmission are
multifaceted, which might be a common characteristic among immune
proteins.<!--lepiej napisać --> The elimination of these effects in the
presence of astrocytic toxin or TTX strongly suggests that they are
modulated by both the GABAergic and astrocytic networks. The mechanisms
of astrocytic modulation of the CeL microcircuit have recently attracted
much attention (Martin-Fernandez *et al.*, 2017; Fan *et al.*, 2021;
Wahis *et al.*, 2021).<!--rozwinąć --> It would, then, be interesting to
test whether the CXCL12 application led to opposing effects in those two
subpopulations in the CeL by using dual patch-clamp experiments. It is
especially of high importance as the impairment of fear acquisition and
extinction induced by intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 was reported to
be eliminated in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub>
receptors (Shi *et al.*, 2016), highlighting the link between GABAergic
system and CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in mediating fear-conditioning.

<!--As mentioned previously, CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->
<!-- Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].

In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018]. -->
<!-- Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].

It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory.

<!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017].

Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions.

## 5.6 Limitations

A few limitations in the presented study should be acknowledged.
<!-- This  approach  was  preferred in this instance to more approximate recording conditions.-->
<!-- First, using immunofluorescence to localize receptors is pretty difficult and thus sometimes leads to inconclusive data. 
Therefore, results from these studies should be treated as preliminary results, and more sensitive methods should be used, such as RNA-scope [@kharchenko_2021] or RNA-sequencing transcriptome [@zhang_2014].due to technical/methodological implication of difficulties regarding immunofluorescent stainings of receptors and imperfections of many antibodies, the results concerning co-localization needs to be verified by using more sensitive methods, such as RNA-scope or .... -->
The presented results reveal that both chemokines mainly modulated the
amygdala’s neuronal firing and/or GABAergic transmission. It should be
noted that during whole-cell patch-clamp recording, the cytoplasm of
recorded neurons is dialyzing with an intrapipette solution. Thus, it
might affect intracellular signaling machinery, and thereby, affect
cellular
excitability.<!-- Soluble components that influence cellular excitability and contribute to signaling pathways are dialyzed from the cell. One frequently encountered consequence is that receptor-mediated responses and/or ionic currents that require soluble second messengers are absent or rapidly “run down” during conventional whole-cell recordings (3, 4). Furthermore, intracellular ion concentrations are disrupted, hampering efforts to determine physiologically relevant responses or properties of channels and receptors (5, 6).-->
A gramicidin perforated patch technique would be a better option to
avoid this issue, as it maintains a relatively intact intracellular
milieu (Akaike & Harata, 1994; Akaike, 1996). Nevertheless, this should
not affect presented results, as the reported effects are eliminated in
the pre-incubation with blockers of receptors, suggesting that they are
specific.

Another issue is that the lack of prominent effects on excitatory
synaptic transmission by chosen chemokines despite observed tendencies
might be related to the use of coronal slices instead of horizontal
sections.<!-- plane--> Thus, the hippocampal and cortex connections,
which are essential inputs to the amygdala, are absent in the coronal
slices used in this study.<!--citations-->

Finally, although widely used, the pharmacological inhibition of either
microglia or astrocytes might not be highly specific. Further dissection
of local communication between astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the
context of chemokines’ modulation will require carefully designed
experiments with multiple points of selective interventions. The
optogenetic technique allows for precise temporal (e.g., milliseconds)
and spatial (e.g., specific cell types) light activation, thereby
modulating cellular excitability, highlighting specificity and
bidirectionally.<!-- Light activation of these proteins modulates cellular excitability with millisecond precision. //  Comparison of electrical and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, highlighting cellular specificity and bidirectionality of optogenetic techniques// The exact dissection of these parallel actions will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions.

# 6 Conclusions

In the present work, the effects of two structurally different
chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, on electrophysiological properties as
well as synaptic transsmision in the amygdala were investigated, mainly
by employing a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Both of these
chemokines are essential during neurodevelopment, and they have been
emerging as key players in neuron-glial interactions and neuromodulation
during adulthood (Réaux-Le Goazigo *et al.*, 2013; Trettel *et al.*,
2020). Moreover, some studies have implicated them as mediators of many
neurobiological diseases, including anxiety and epilepsy (Yang *et al.*,
2016; Schubert *et al.*, 2018).<!--dodać citations z epilepsy-->
Increased anxiety and seizures are considered manifestations of
amygdala’s malfunctioning. For example, several lines of evidence
illustrate that BLA hyperexcitability manifests behaviorally as anxiety,
emotional dysregulation, or development of seizure
activity.<!--citations?-->

Findings presented in this PhD dissertation illustrate that both CX3CL1
and CXCL12 modulate the activity of the amygdala network; however, in an
opposite manner. The main findings of the study regarding CX3CL1 in the
BLA are as follows: the CX3CL1 application decreased excitability and
impaired LTP at the concentration of 5nM and GABAergic synaptic
transmission was downregulated following CX3CL1 application. Based on
these observations and previous literature regarding similar mechanisms
in the BLA (Zonta *et al.*, 2011; Veres *et al.*, 2014; Wefelmeyer *et
al.*, 2015; Saha *et al.*, 2016), we speculate that CX3CL1 acts on
PV-expressing subpopulation of BLA interneurons. These interneurons
target the AIS of principal cells, and decreased GABAergic activity in
this area was shown to change the threshold current needed for eliciting
an action potential. At the network level, PV-containing interneurons
are also implicated in the attenuation of the LTP (Wolff *et al.*, 2014;
Saha *et al.*, 2016).

Moreover, reduction of GABAergic synaptic activity in AIS was shown to
be mediated by microglia in the cortex (Chen *et al.*, 2014). Thus,
considering our findings together with the well-documented abundance of
the CX3CR1 receptor in the microglia in the CNS, it is possible that a
similar mechanism could be present in the amygdala.

Similarly, CX3CL1 also displayed cell-type-specific actions in the CeL.
Specifically, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce the input resistance and
membrane time constant, decrease the excitability and induce
depolarization in the Regular-Firing neurons but not in the Late-Firing
neurons. Those electrophysiological effects are hallmarks of HCN
activation.<!--citations--> Thus, it is tempting to speculate that
CX3CL1 might modulate HCN channels. In addition, the reduced firing in
the Regular-Firing cells is in good agreement with decreased frequency
of sIPSCs onto Late-Firing cells, as the Regular-Spiking neurons were
previously reported to send more dense and potent connections onto
Late-Firing cells and *vice versa* (Hou *et al.*, 2016).

Interestingly, the pre-treatment with minocycline, probably by
inhibition of microglia (for example: Peng *et al.* (2016); Scianni *et
al.* (2013); Yuan *et al.* (2020)), increased the firing of principal
cells in the BLA and Late-Firing in the CeL. These effects were
eliminated after CX3CL1 application, probably due to the neuroprotective
role of CX3CL1. The deletion of CX3CR1 in microglia led to neuronal
death in such models as systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Cardona *et al.*, 2006),
implicating CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in pathophysiological augmentation
of glutamatergic transmission. Moreover, the upregulation of CX3CL1 was
shown to reduce neurodegeneration in an animal model of PD (Morganti *et
al.*, 2012) or AD (Finneran & Nash, 2019). Thus, it is possible that the
elimination of minocycline-induced facilitation of principal cells’
firing is also a manifestation of CX3CL1 neuroprotective actions and
that this chemokine exerts anxiolytic effects in the BLA.

The results concerning CXCL12 present a complex
picture.<!--jakoś inaczej napisać..--> In the BLA, according to Yang *et
al.* (2016) hypothesis, there is a tendency toward the enhanced
excitability of principal cells after CXCL12 application. However, the
CXCL12-mediated enhancement of the excitatory transmission was not
replicated here, probably due to a different slice orientation and/or
the GABAergic modulation of this effect. Indeed, the exogenous CXCL12
did affect the inhibitory synaptic transmission in a subset of principal
cells, although these effects were not statistically significant.
Nevertheless, most neurons responded with decreased frequency of sIPSCs
at the concentration of 2nM in the BLA, whereas at a higher
concentration (5nM), the median frequency of sIPSCs was increased.

In the CeL, obtained data showed that the exogenous CXCL12 decreased
threshold, and thus increasing the excitability of both Regular-Spiking
and Late-Firing neurons. However, the excitatory synaptic transmission
was upregulated only onto Regular-Spiking neurons, suggesting that
either BLA principal neurons or PVN neurons preferentially innervate the
Regular-Spiking, SOM-expressing neurons. This is in line with a study
showing that PVT neurons preferentially innervated SOM-positive neurons
in CeL (Penzo *et al.*, 2015), which is in good agreement with the
observed enhancement of excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking
neurons. Notably, based on the concentration (2nM vs. 5nM), CXCL12
produced an opposite trend towards decreased or increased frequency of
excitatory synaptic events. This is consistent with our data showing
elevated excitability of principal neurons at higher concentration.
Intriguingly, although those cells are well-known to innervate CeL
neurons, Li *et al.* (2013) showed that these connections are more
evident onto SOM-expressing neurons during fear-conditioning. This may
be linked with observations that intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12
impaired the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear response
(Shi *et al.*, 2016). Therefore, the underlying mechanism of CXCL12
involvement during fear-conditioning and anxiety is of importance to be
further elucidated.

Findings obtained in this study illustrated that CXCL12 also affected
GABAergic system. Specifically, CXCL12 was shown to increase the
frequency of sIPSCs in Regular-Firing neurons and decreased the
amplitude of those currents in the Late-Firing neurons. Moreover, both
action potential-dependent and astrocytic mechanisms were illustrated to
be involved in those effects.  
This is in line with the another study, where intra-amygdala infusion of
CXCL12 led to impairment of fear acquisition and extinction in a
GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors-dependent manner (Shi
*et al.*, 2016). Hence, the further investigations how CXCL12 modulate
fear-conditioning and anxiety is of high importance.

Altogether, data presented in this PhD dissertation lay the fundamental
groundwork to further investigate neuron-glia crosstalk and chemokine
signaling in the amygdala. Therefore, our results together with the
published literature provide support for general hypothesis that
chemokines, in addition to traditional neurotransmitters and
neuropeptides, represent a neuromodulatory system in the CNS.
<!--Altogether, current data add another piece to the growing body of evidence of chemokines' neuromodulatory effects in the CNS. /// CX3CL1 and other chemokines may also represent a new class of CNS neuromodulators, impacting brain function *via* their effects on traditional neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems, including the 5-HT system (Adler and Rogers, 2005; Adler et al., 2006; Calle-waere et al., 2007; Rostene et al., 2007). -->
Moreover, this study also highlights the importance of using horizontal
slices in electrophysiological approaches when investigating the
excitatory synaptic transmission in the amygdala (Halbach & Albrecht,
2002).<!-- or add methodological value--> Of note, observed opposing
actions for CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 illustrated that chemokine
signaling in the amygdala is highly dynamic. Hence, the understanding of
the peculiar pharmacological responses of chemokine receptors in
different circuits and cell types of the amygdala is of particular
importance, given their potential role in the etiology of emotional
disorders and their corresponding usefulness as therapeutic targets to
manage emotional disorders.
<!-- Taken together, CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 network actions and the regulation of glia-neuron communication make it possible to fine-tune amygdala activity and resulting output to maintain emotional homeostasis. Taken together, the rich diversity of neuro-peptides and their receptors in the central amygdala, second only to the hypothalamus, makes it possible to fine-tune amygdala activity and resulting output to maintain emotional homeostasis. // zerżnięte z van der bourg review o peptides in CeA - analogicznie dla chemokin -->
<!--Thus, further experiments identifying the properties and functions of each of neuronal, microglial, astrocytic and, oligodendrocytic compartments remain to be addressed.-->

<!--Nevertheless, even though chemokines are released during all pathological states, including inflammation, it is important to determine their role in physiological, non-inflammatory state. 
Even though cytokines released by stress in brain have the capability of influencing neural function, it has yet to be determined how stress in a ‘‘sterile’’ environment (i.e., in the absence of infection) can increase these cytokines in brain. This latter aspect too must be addressed before the full impact of stress in relation to cytokine influences on neural function is understood. The means by which cytokines are involved in stress is important because cytokines and stress are implicated in pain ( Fu and Neugebauer, 2008; Vachon-Presseau et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2001 ), sleep ( Krueger et al., 2007; Churchill et al., 2008 ), depression ( Caspi et al., 2003; Hammen, 2005 ), anxiety ( Breese et al., 2008; Shin and Liberzon, 2010 ) and drug addiction ( Breese et al., 2011; Koob, 2008 ). A further understanding of the unknowns by which cytokines contribute to stress to alter neural function may allow a better appreciation of the complexity by which stress induces changes in neural transmission that contribute to the functional changes associated with stress-linked central disorders.-->
<!-- NAC modulates antioxidant, glutamatergic, inflammatory and neurotrophic pathways in the central nervous system, all of which are relevant to anxiety pathology.chemokines // conclusion?
Thus, the present efforts not only will provide further evidence that cytokines affect CeA neural function, but also will explore the means by which CeA-neural function can be associated with TNFa-induction of glutamate and GABA activity. 
Such extended information concerning actions of cytokines on CeA neurons is expected to further our understanding of the relationship stress-induction of cytokines has to facilitation of anxiety-like behavior that follows stress ( Breese et al., 2004, 2008, 2011; Knapp et al., 2011 ).-->

With regard to the IL-1β effects on ethanol-induced facilitation of CeA GABAergic transmission, our data indicate that IL-1β interacts with ethanol presynaptically to occlude ethanol’s enhancement of GABA signaling. Understanding these complex interactions of acute ethanol with IL-1 on GABAergic transmission are critical for shedding light on the potential role of the IL-1 neuroimmune system in the development of alcohol dependence and addiction.-->
