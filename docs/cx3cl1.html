<p>At levels reached during inflammatory conditions, CX3CL1 signaling has previously been associated with activation of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of molecules such as Akt, as well as activation of MAP kinases such as p-38 and Erk1/2 (p44/42; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000; Cambien et al., 2001; Deiva et al., 2004; Klosowska et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2009)</p>
<p>While previous studies have shown that CX3CL1 causes an increase in intracellular calcium in neurons and other cell types (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Ragozzino et al., 2006) this effect of CX3CL1 becomes apparent at concentrations of 25 nM and higher (Oh et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004), well above the levels we investigated here and we observed no such increase in intracellular calcium. At a concentration of 2 nM, in both neurons and non-neurons, CX3CL1 pre-incubation suppressed glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium levels. These data are in good agreement with previous findings of a protective effect of inflammatory levels of CX3CL1 against glutamate excitotoxicity and glutamate NMDA receptor activation, in particular (Meucci et al., 1998; Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005), although, unlike the current work, the latter effect was linked to increased intracellular calcium (Ragozzino et al., 2006). Calcium oscillations in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells are important for cellular growth, migration and synaptic structural refinement (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Komuro and Rakic, 1998; Spitzer et al., 2000). Thus, the dampening of such signaling by CX3CL1 is suggestive of a role in stability of network connectivity and activity. Overall, the current data along with information in the published literature reveal that a role for CX3CL1 in control of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission during excitotoxic events can be extended to situations of synaptic plasticity required for normal functions such as memory formation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> GABA<sub>A</sub></h2>
<p>The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/chloride channel blocker, picrotoxin, used in the current studies would decrease GABAergic inhibitory transmission promoting depolarization in some cells with corresponding increases in intracellular calcium (Antonucci et al., 2012). Thus, the current work suggests GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/chloride channel activity within the hippocampal neuronal network must be intact for CX3CL1 to attenuate glutamatergic neurotransmission or LTP.
This situation is remarkably similar to that described for CX3CL1 inhibition of serotonergic neurons of the Raphe nucleus (Heinisch and Kirby, 2009). While this effect may relate to basal inhibitory tone, CX3CL1 could actually be enhancing GABAA receptor function. For example, CX3CL1 enhances phosphorylation and activation of Akt in neurons and this serine/threonine kinase has been associated with phosphorylation of the GABAA beta2 receptor subunit, a modification that enhances activity of the receptor (Meucci et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2003). Moreover, several signaling systems can enhance GABAmediated inhibition through promotion of rapid insertion of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors into the post-synaptic plasma membrane (Wan et al., 1997; Nusser et al., 1998; Mizoguchi et al., 2003; Jovanovic et al., 2004) - Sheridan2014</p>

By employing transgenic mice with chronically elevated expression of CCL2 specifically in astrocytes, it was showed that CCL2 reduced synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, whereas it enhanced short-term synaptic plasticity [@nelson_2011].
However, although both acute and chronic CCL2 leads to presynaptic alternations in glutamatergic input to the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the molecular mechanism underlying this discrepancy remains unclear. 
As those experiments varied regarding: (i) CCL2 application (acute vs. chronic), (ii) source (astrocytic vs. bath-applied during recordings), (iii) method (patch-clamp vs. extracellular recordings), more studies clarifying this issue are needed.-->
<!-- Glu - connexins - ACKR3 - astrocytes
 Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].-->
<!--Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].
It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis.-->
<!-- Glu - oligodendrocytes - maybe some oligodenrocytes have some receptors of interest? 
The importance of oligodendrocytes in the regulation of synaptic transmission is just now being appreciated, and only scarce evidence has been reported so far. 
However, few studies suggested two molecular targets, which may be involved in this phenomenon: BDNF and glutamine synthetase (GS).
Recently, it was shown that oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF might function *via* presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to ensure fast, reliable neurotransmitter release in the developing brain [@jang_2019].
Moreover, this mechanism was recently described to play a role in cognitive impairment [@geraghty_2019].<!-- chyba BDNF derived from microglia 
Another promising molecule is GS.
The study illustrated that depletion of OL GS disrupts neuronal glutamate signaling with accompanying changes in behavioral function [@xin_2019].
Interestingly, OLs survival and myelination were unaffected, thus demonstrating a myelin-independent role for oligodendrocytes in supporting glutamate signaling in the brain [@xin_2019]. -->
<!-- GABA and microglia / astrocytes / ? -->
<!-- In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018]. -->

<!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. 
In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. 
Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. 
However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->

Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function. -->
<!-- introduction of discussion? -->
<p>The effects of chemokines in the brain may be due to their ability to activate chemokine receptors localized on neurons and/or glia, thus leading to changes in neuronal membrane properties and/or synaptic transmission.
Specifically, chemokines may alter synaptic transmitter release <span class="citation">Ragozzino <em>et al.</em> (2002)</span>, modulate the functional properties of ionic channels <span class="citation">Oh <em>et al.</em> (2002)</span> and promote the release of glutamate from astrocytes <span class="citation">(Lax <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>.

In our previous studies, we concluded that the effects of CXCL12 on DG neural stem cells were likely to be mediated post-synaptically (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). Indeed, CXCR4 receptors are clearly expressed by these cells (Tran et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). It is also clear from our experiments that adult neural stem cells express the receptor (or at least ‘a receptor’) for CXCL14. Thus, CXCL14 increased [Ca2+]iin these cells, one of the cardinal signs of chemokine receptor signaling. Given the fact that neural progenitor cells express the receptor for CXCL14 and the observation that the chemokine reduces the amplitude of GABAergic PSCs recorded from these cells one might conclude that the effect of CXCL14 is at least partly mediated post-synaptically. However, it is quite possible that a pre-synaptic effect is also involved. Precise identification of the mechanism by which CXCL14 produces its effect will have to await further studies on identifying its receptor and its location in the DG. -->

CXCL12 a increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12 a . It is therefore likely that CXCL12 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.0.1</span> CX3CR1, microglia and stress</h4>
<p>Although CX3CR1 is widely acknowledged as pivotal for brain development and function, evidence on how it regulates microglial differentiation under psychosocial stress is limited (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017).
We hereby provide evidence that CX3CR1 expression was dampened in both CRS animals and schizophrenia patients, and CX3CR1 gene had less interactions with other brain genes in schizophrenia; this receptor was further found to be important for CD206+ microglial subtype differentiation and morphological process arborization, and its deficiency resulted in social dominancy impairment.</p>
<p>A handful of studies have utilized CX3CR1-deficient mice to explore the role of this receptor in chronic stress, regarding its regulation by stress (Bollinger et al., 2016; Bollinger et al., 2017; Trojan et al., 2017), its importance for microglial morphological ramification and phagocytosis (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017), and its beneficial versus detrimental role in brain and behavioral responses to physio-pathological (Gunner et al., 2019; Lowery et al., 2017; Schecter et al., 2017) or psychosocial stressors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Winkler et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2013).
Among these, studies have showed that CX3CR1 rescued chronic stress-induced increase in microglial phagocytosis (Milior et al., 2016) and decrease in hippocampal long-term potentiation (Milior et al., 2016), while improving neurogenesis and short-term memory (Rimmerman et al., 2017).
CX3CR1-deficiency caused social withdrawal and increased repetitive behavior (Zhan et al., 2014), as well as increased fear acquisition and reinstatement (Schubert et al., 2018), implicating a beneficial function of CX3CR1 for the stressed brain.
However, other studies showed that CX3CR1-deficient mice were resistant to chronic stress-induced depressive-like and anxiety behaviors (Hellwig et al., 2016; Milior et al., 2016; Rimmerman et al., 2017; Wohleb et al., 2017), jointly implying a detrimental role of CX3CR1 in psychiatric disorders. <span class="citation">(<strong>paiirainen_2021?</strong>)</span></p>
<p>We previously found that microglia from mice with high-anxiety traits were prone to polarization from a CD206+to an MHCII+phenotype (Li et al., 2014), and identified candidate innate immune genes involved in synaptic plasticity (Ma et al., 2015).
We also observed the regional heterogeneity of microglia and its potential importance for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders (Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020; Xuan et al., 2019). <span class="citation">(<strong>paiirainen_2021?</strong>)</span></p>

Thus, to determine further whether microglia specifically control synaptic transmission in the BLA, we injected Saporin toxin conjugated to macrophage antigen complex-1 (Mac-1, integrin CD11b/ CD18 receptor localized to microglia) directly into the BLA of 8-week-old C57BL/6N females to transiently deplete microglia.

<p>At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA<!--, especially its lateral part,--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS (e.g., terminals from the auditory thalamus and cortex) and a strong input carrying US information (e.g., footshock).
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, <span class="citation">Nabavi <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>).
Accordingly, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), <span class="citation">Kim &amp; Won (2017)</span> found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In PPF (at multiple synapses), the second pair of stimuli separated by a few tens of milliseconds produces a larger synaptic response than the first, owing to the transient elevation of Ca2+in terminal boutons produced by the second stimulus summing with the residual Ca2+produced by the first stimulus, and increasing the probability of transmitter release. Since probability of transmitter release cannot exceed 1, the PPF ratio tends to decrease as probability of release increases (Bliss &amp; Collingridge, 2013). Therefore, in the LA the glutamate release in response to paired pulse stimulation seems to be reduced in TPH2− / −mice.

<p>Generally, the increase in sIPSC or sEPSC frequency enhanced the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Thus, the effect of minocycline on SG neurons is mainly of a presynaptic origin rather than a postsynaptic origin</p>
<p>Neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal is triggered by a Na+ channel-dependent action potential, a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the somatodendritic region, and presynaptic ligand- gated channel activation. For example, an endogenous peptide antisecretory factor reduced the frequency of sIPSCs, but not mIPSCs, in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Strandberg et al., 2014). Likewise, if an increase in sIPSC frequency is triggered by a Na+ channel- dependent action potential, then the Na+ channel blocker TTX should block the effect of minocycline. In contrast, the increase in mIPSC frequency induced by minocycline was not blocked by bath application of TTX. It has been demonstrated that Na+ channels, which account for action potential propagation expressed in lamina I/II of the spinal cord, are entirely TTX-sensitive (Hildebrand et al., 2011). Therefore, our results together with the published literature suggest that a Na+ channel-dependent action potential is not involved in the effect of minocycline on inhibitory transmission. It remains unclear whether a subthreshold depolarizing current spread from the somatodendritic region contributes to minocycline response. We next investigated whether glutamate receptor- mediated sEPSCs are involved in the increase in GABA and glycine release. Our data show that the effect of minocycline under the treatment with CNQX and APV was the same as with TTX. Therefore, it is possible that the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmitter release is due to presynaptic ligand-gated channel activation. The spontaneous synaptic neurotransmitter release of dorsal horn neurons relies critically on presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (Bourinet et al., 2014).- Peng2016</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1.1</span> GABA and chemokine</h4>
<p>Three types of GABA receptors, two ligand-gated channels, GABAA and GABAC, and one metabotropic, GABAB, have been described to date (Chebib and Johnston 1999). The selective GABAA antagonist bicuculline fully abolished the GABA response in our system, indicating that it was mediated through GABA<sub>A</sub> ionotropic receptors. As expected from an ionotropic response, the effect of GABA was fast-triggered (100 ms) in our model. Interestingly, MCP1/CCL2 inhibition of the GABA response was observed following concomitant application of the chemokine and the neurotransmitter, indicating that it took less than 100 ms for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. Such a fast event suggests that the classical G protein-mediated signalling cascades associated with GPCR activation were not operated by MCP1/CCL2. This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that GTP was not required in the intracellular medium for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. One possible explanation that might account for such a fast GTP-independent MCP1/CCL2 effect, as observed here, might be that CCR2 activation by its agonist ligand resulted in an inhibition of GABAAreceptor activity through direct receptor–receptor interactions. There are some examples in the literature of such interactions between GPCRs and ionotropic receptors (Liu et al . 2000; Lee et al . 2002; Fiorentini et al . 2003). Further studies that combine biochemical, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches are needed to test this intriguing hypothesis. GABA plays a major role in spinal cord physiology as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). One classical function exerted by GABA is its participation in the inhibitory modulation of somatosensory transmission, including nociception (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). In particular, the blockade of spinal GABAAreceptors has been shown to cause hyperalgesia and lead to tactile allodynia in the rat (Malan et al . 2002). This consideration might shed some light on the physiological relevance of the present findings. Indeed, a sizeable number of studies reporting the facilitation of either inflammatory or neuropathic pain by chemokines is now available (Boddeke 2001). Thus, numerous chemokines, including MCP-1/CCL2, have been shown to elicit transient Ca2+currents in dorsal root ganglion neurones (Oh et al . 2001). Moreover, MCP-1/ CCL2 and other chemokines have been shown to crossdesensitize opioid receptors in both dorsal root ganglion and periaqueducal grey matter neurones (Szabo et al . 2002; Zhang et al . 2004). More to the point, MCP-1/CCL2 has been shown to induce mechanical allodynia after intrathecal administration (Tanaka et al . 2004), acting in this regard like a GABAAreceptor antagonist (Malan et al . 2002). Finally, the involvement of MCP-1/CCL2 in pain is strongly supported by the recent observation that mice lacking the CCR2 receptor were markedly less sensitive to noxious stimuli in models of neuropathic pain (Abbadie et al . 2003). It is therefore tempting to propose that the potent inhibition of GABA-induced activation of GABAAreceptors by MCP1/ CCL2, as reported here, might be one of the mechanisms by which the chemokine and its receptor, CCR2, facilitate nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level. In accordance with this hypothesis, our autoradiographic results showed a high density of [125I]MCP-1/CCL2 binding sites in areas I–IV of the dorsal horn and in the central cervical nucleus in the cervical cord, two regions known to receive somatosensory input from sensory neurones. As mentioned above, GABA is a wide-spectrum inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and, consequently, its actions spread well beyond the control of pain. It is also implicated in the modulation of other somatosensory spinal inputs and in the membrane excitability of ventral horn motoneurones (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). Our immunolabelling data indicate that CCR2 is constitutively expressed by a majority of spinal neurones. It is therefore likely that MCP-1/CCL2 could act on other neuronal spinal networks to attenuate GABA inhibitory actions in both physiological and pathological situations.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1.2</span> NMDA</h4>
<p>NMDARs are versatile receptors modulating physiological and pathological activities in the nervous system. They are involved in development, synapse maturation, synaptic transmission and plasticity processes, and their dysfunction has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Hardingham and Bading, 2010; Zhou and Sheng, 2013; Ghasemi et al., 2014). NMDAR stimulation may induce neuronal death (Choi, 1987; Choi et al., 1988; Tymianski et al., 1993) or protection, also through preconditioning (Grabb and Choi, 1999; Navon et al., 2012). <span class="citation">Lauro <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span></p>

<p>These features are concordant with an increased number of synapses, an interpretation supported by our Golgi stains where we found a greater density of dendritic spines in EAE mice. A parallel increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and change in AMPAR dynamics is also consistent with an increase in the number of mature functional synapses and dendritic spines in response to EAE induction (Danglot et al., 2012; Hanse et al., 2013). It is thought that new spines are associated with more AMPARs compared with NMDA receptors (Zito et al., 2009). The AMPAR activation can lead to spine maturation (Fischer et al., 2000; Hoshiko et al., 2012).- Acharjee2018b</p>
<p>Although DA release and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (cultures vs. slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CXCL12 in both systems. <!-- analogous to CX3CL1 dendritic spines and electrophysiology --></p>

<p>Based on these observations, we speculate that … microglia may have begun to intervene in the NTS …</p>
<p>This suggests that CX3CR1-microglia in the NTS participates in NO and systemic blood pressure regulation</p>
<p>This notion was further supported by the observed reduction of sIPSC frequency after CX3CL1 treatment.
Usually, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, while a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of transmitter release and/or changes in the number of active synapses (De Koninck and Mody, 1994; Otis et al , 1994).
The reduction in average amplitude after NF knockdown may result from a decreased frequency of larger events, probably due to a reduction of number of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>receptors (Otis et al , 1994). However, the lack of observed alterations in the frequency could be explained by the fact that relative to the overall GABAergic input, only a very small number of synapses were completely removed at the AIS, while smaller events remained. Nevertheless, our results provide direct evidence that NF knockdown impairs GABAergic transmission within the BLA by reducing functional GABAAreceptors at the postsynaptic site.</p>
<p>Whereas PPF in TPH2− / −mice was significantly increased in the LA with presumably lower probability of transmitter release, no changes were found in the</p>
<p>The behavior of TPH2− / −mice in the sucrose preference test, tail suspension and forced swim tests and their responses to the unpredictable chronic mild stress and learned helplessness paradigms are in general similar to the TPH2+/+mice, although in some studies mild alterations were observed in these paradigms (Angoa-Perez et al., 2014; Gutknecht et al., 2015; Mosienko et al., 2012). These behavioral tests are stress-dependent and correlate with our results.</p>
<p>These results demonstrated that both GluN2A and GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors are functionally expressed at thalamo-amygdala synapses, and can be at least partially isolated using these two drugs.</p>
<p>Therefore, we tested the effects of these NMDA subunit antagonists on the formation of LTP/LTD in LA neurons.</p>
