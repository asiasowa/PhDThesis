<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>Chemokines are a class of small immune proteins emerging as neuromodulators and coordinators of neuron-glial communication.
Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are particularly important in this regard, as they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they were shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, as well as the behavioral level <span class="citation">(Trettel <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Sowa &amp; Tokarski, 2021)</span>.
Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors <span class="citation">(Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Schubert <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
As their receptors, CXCR4 and CX3CR1, are relatively densely present in the amygdala <span class="citation">(Harrison <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Banisadr <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Stumm <em>et al.</em>, 2002, 2003; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>, the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders <span class="citation">(Mahan &amp; Ressler, 2012; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014; Gilpin <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored.
Moreover, since distinct nuclei of the amygdala play different roles in fear processing<!--lepiej napisać-->, it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 affect electrophysiological properties and synaptic transmission in those regions.
To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA).
Moreover, considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication, the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of chemokine-modulated effects.
Performing all electrophysiological experiments using acute brain slices pretreated with microglial inhibitor and astrocytic toxin allowed for dissecting local neuro-glial cross-talk in these regions.</p>
<div id="discusscx3cl1bla" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala</h2>
<p>The findings of this study provide evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing their threshold current, significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA synapses.
These effects were specific for CX3CR1 receptor activation and probably mediated by microglia.</p>
<p>Principal cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are well-known to converge information about both conditional and unconditional stimuli.
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, <span class="citation">Nabavi <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>).
Moreover, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), <span class="citation">Kim &amp; Won (2017)</span> found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.
Accordingly, plasticity at synapses onto principal cells in this region is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and storage of new fear memories <span class="citation">(Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Hence, their activity is tightly regulated by a broad array of factors, including a GABAergic system or different types of neuromodulators (<span class="citation">Prager <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> and references therein).</p>
<p>Here, the reduced excitability was demonstrated after the CX3CL1 application, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting action potentials.
Thus, the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the principal cells’ firing may have significant consequences on BLA physiology.
To block this receptor, two approaches were used.
Although pre-incubating slices with an antibody against CX3CL1 abolished the observed effect, a small portion of neurons still remained responsive to CX3CL1.
This may be due to the limited tissue penetration of antibodies, estimated around 50μm, while slices used for this study were 300μm thick.
Thus another approach was used by employing the pharmacological inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797.
The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures <span class="citation">(Lannes <em>et al.</em>, 2019)</span> as well as <em>in vivo</em> administered both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) <span class="citation">(Ho <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span> and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model <span class="citation">(Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10μ <span class="citation">(Ridderstad Wollberg <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Baxter <em>et al.</em>, 2021)</span>, was also effective in experiments presented here.
Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not affect any measured electrophysiological parameters.
Thus, in the remaining experiments, the concentration of 10μM was applied.</p>
<p>The presented CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP is consistent with many previous studies showing CX3CL1-induced inhibition of LTP or mimicking long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus <span class="citation">(Bertollini <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Maggi <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>, without affecting paired-pulse ratio <span class="citation">(Bertollini <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Consistently, in this study, a CX3CL1-mediated increase in the threshold current was observed, leading to a reduction of principal cells’ firing.</p>
<p>Many lines of evidence show neuroprotective and beneficial actions of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.
For instance, the expression of CX3CL1 is upregulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission, such as after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus or ischemia, where it is consistently shown to reduce neurotoxicity <span class="citation">(Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Cipriani <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Yeo <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Its beneficial actions were also reported in neurodegenerative models, where it was shown to rescue motor coordination <span class="citation">(Morganti <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span> or reduce Tau-pathology <span class="citation">(Finneran &amp; Nash, 2019)</span>.
Moreover, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents with a mechanism that involves increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Lauro <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>, a hallmark of the LTD.
Thus, this predominantly inhibitory role is suggested to be a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes <span class="citation">(Bertollini <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Piccinin <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Importantly, in the BLA, many disorders are linked with the increased excitability of pyramidal-like cells along with the elevated magnitude of LTP.
Indeed, blocking LTP with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to facilitate extinction <span class="citation">(Falls <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Walker &amp; Davis, 2002; Yang &amp; Lu, 2005; Sotres-Bayon <em>et al.</em>, 2007)</span>.<!--nowsze cytowania--><!-- więcej zaburzeń -->
Therefore, considering its well-documented neuroprotective role in other brain structures, the reduced activity of PCs along with impaired LTP in the BLA may suggest the anxiolytic actions of CX3CL1.</p>
<p>Unlike what is observed in the hippocampus, this study did not find any effects of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.<!--jakoś lepiej to napisać?-->
These regional differences between hippocampus and amygdala may be linked to the fact that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, but rather its action is mediated by adenosine, released from microglia upon CX3CR1 receptor activation <span class="citation">(Lauro <em>et al.</em>, 2008, 2010; Piccinin <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
As mentioned in the Introduction (see <a href="intro.html#chemointheCNS">1.1.3</a>) depending on the adenosinergic receptor activation, adenosine exerts opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus <span class="citation">(Piccinin <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Specifically, further evidence indicated that CX3CL1-induced adenosine action <em>via</em> A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>3</sub>R receptor led to decreased glutamatergic transmission <span class="citation">Lauro <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>, whereas A<sub>2A</sub>R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-triggered increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC), observed when the A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors are blocked <span class="citation">(Piccinin <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, <span class="citation">Scianni <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span> demonstrated that the CX3CL1-modulated NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs) elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum by releasing D-serine from glial cells and adenosine, which in turn modulate NMDAR and the A<sub>2A</sub>R subtype.<!-- NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs)  elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum-->
Thus, these findings raise the possibility that CX3CL1 also induces the release of adenosine in the BLA, which in turn, is a downstream molecule of the observed electrophysiological effects.
Consistent with this idea, both A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R receptors were documented to modulate the excitatory AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission and LTP <span class="citation">(Rau <em>et al.</em>, 2014, 2015; Simões <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, as it was observed in the hippocampus <span class="citation">(Mendonça &amp; Ribeiro, 1994; Maggi <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Costenla <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.<!-- These findings are suggestive of the possible mediation of CX3CL1-induced effects by adenosine. // A1R activation inhibits spontaneous and evoked AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission,13 while A2AR increase the firing rate of BLA pyramidal neurons14 and facilitate long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) of LA population spikes, evoked by stimulating external mainly cortical afferents.15-->
Importantly, while the study documented the activation of A<sub>2A</sub>R elevated the amplitude of NMDA currents in the hippocampus <span class="citation">(Dias <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>, decreased NMDA-EPSCs were observed following the bath-application of A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists in the amygdala <span class="citation">(Pliássova <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
This opposing action of adenosine between these two regions on the excitatory synaptic transmission might account for the differences in glutamatergic currents observed in the present study after CX3CL1 treatment.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on excitatory synaptic transmission possibly depends upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons.<!--trochę bardziej zmienić?-->
As mentioned in the Introduction (see <a href="intro.html#chemointheCNS">1.1.3</a>), distal dendrites of principal neurons receive high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from both within the BLA and outside this structure <span class="citation">(Brinley-Reed <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Farb &amp; LeDoux, 1997; Farb &amp; Ledoux, 1999)</span>.
This subcellular domain is also the target of local somatostatin-positive interneurons <span class="citation">(Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2007)</span>.
Thus, SOM-expressing neurons may influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
As whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study were made from the soma, and the potassium-based intrapipette solution was used, excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites needed to travel more distance, and therefore, could be decreased by GABAergic synapses.
Hence, they might not be detected from baseline noise.
Noting that cesium blocks potassium currents, additional experiments using cesium-based intrapipette solution might resolve whether CX3CL1 mediate changes contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites <span class="citation">(Williams &amp; Mitchell, 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of changes in the paired-pulse ratio of field EPSP, together with inconclusive changes in the frequency of sEPSC, implies postsynaptic actions of CX3CL1.
Intriguingly, the suppression of principal cells’ firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance.<!-- However, the input resistance and other passive membrane properties remained unchanged following CX3CL1 treatment, suggesting that this effect was rather presynaptic.-->
The action potentials result from a dynamic interplay between not only the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron but also their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduction of pyramidal-like neurons’ firing is the regulation by a GABAergic inhibitory system.
Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the CNS is mediated by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, a heteropentameric chloride permeable, GABA-gated member of ligand-gated ion channels, whereas slow inhibitory synaptic transmission is associated with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor.<!--więcej o nich-->
Indeed, in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432, CX3CL1 failed to depolarize threshold current, illustrating that those receptors were involved in this effect.
However, one would expect that reduced principal cells’ firing is a consequence of increased inhibition onto those cells.<!--lepiej napisać // -->
In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA, reflected as decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs.
Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) <span class="citation">(Doze <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Bellingham &amp; Berger, 1996)</span>, sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity.<!--zmienić!!!!!!/// klenowski_2015 , and both factors are limited by the number of inhibitory synapses-->
Moreover, a change in the amplitude of <!--m-->IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas a change in the frequency of <!--m-->IPSCs implicates an altered probability of GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses <span class="citation">(De Koninck &amp; Mody, 1994; Otis <em>et al.</em>, 1994)</span>.<!--bardziej zmienić?-->
Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 treatment, which was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggests a CX3CL1-mediated inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking and/or a decreased reactivity or number of GABA<sub>A</sub> postsynaptic receptors.
Nevertheless, these results provide direct evidence that CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission within the BLA, probably by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.<!-- może silniej? direct evidence?-->
These data are consistent with findings in other brain regions such as the DRN, where CX3CL1 enhanced postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor number or sensitivity on serotonergic neurons <span class="citation">(Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009)</span>.
Similar action was reported in another electrophysiological study using human tissue from epileptic patients.
The epileptic tissue is characterized by more pronounced desensitization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors than healthy tissue, manifested as a decrease in GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated currents following repetitive GABA applications.
However, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce this rundown in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients <span class="citation">(Roseti <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>, illustrating that this chemokine might stabilize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor currents.
Hence, both studies reported CX3CL1-triggered modulation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, leading to increased sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to GABA inputs.
Importantly, one study also documented that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were involved in the CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP in the dentate gyrus <span class="citation">(Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
While CX3CL1 reduced the magnitude of LTP in the DG, this phenomenon was abolished in the presence of a GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker.
All these findings, including those presented in this dissertation, highlight that the actions of the chemokine CX3CL1 may vary depending on the balance between excitation and inhibition in the neuronal network.
Thus, at least in the hippocampus, the CX3CL1 neuroprotective inhibition of glutamatergic drive is thought to be present during periods of enhanced excitatory transmission and intact GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity <span class="citation">(Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.</p>

<!-- composition of GABA subunit in the amygdal...
The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
 The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).-->
<!-- development
In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). 
Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.
Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

<p>Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment (AIS) of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, triggered by, for example, changing the action potential threshold (<span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>, <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> and references within).<!--citations?--><!-- The activity of principal cells is well-documented to be tightly regulated by a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. // plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability.--><!-- Importantly, GABAergic inputs were reported to be able to control spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially when formed at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment, a region critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. ///Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AACs can control action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold, or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014).

Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin (PV).<!--Anatomically, PV-INs with this characteristic feedback excitation are chandelier INs ( Woodruff et al., 2006 ; Spampanato et al., 2016 ; Szabadics et al., 2006 ).-->

Importantly, one elegant study conducted by <span class="citation">Saha <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> has shown that specific reduction of a pool of GABAergic synapses innervating the AIS of BLA projection neurons resulted in similar effects observed after acute CX3CL1 application.
Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as well as impaired LTP.
What is more, the decreased excitability of principal cells was associated with increased threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered <span class="citation">(Zonta <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Saha <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, through changing the action potential threshold <span class="citation">(Somogyi <em>et al.</em>, 1982; Douglas &amp; Martin, 1990; Veres <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Wefelmeyer <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.<!--zmienić bardziej!!!--><!-- Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after acute CX3CL1 treatment arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005).-->

In support of this supposition, microglia, the main cell type expressing CX3CR1 receptors in the CNS, were reported to displace the inhibitory synapses at AIS in the cortex <span class="citation">(Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.</p>
<!-- Accordingly, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). -->
<p>At the network level, while impaired LTP in the external capsule–BLA pathway after CX3CL1 application in the BLA is consistent with CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells’ excitability, its relation to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first sight.
However, mounting evidence indicates that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons <span class="citation">(McDonald <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Unal <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>, thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the induction of LTP in this structure.
Similar to the cellular level, the chandelier PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation is a good candidate for observed CX3CL1-mediated actions in the BLA.
For instance, it may be related to previous studies suggesting rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA <span class="citation">(Woodruff <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.<!--However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010)// zmienić bardziej -->
Following this idea, CX3CL1 could inhibit those cells, leading to an observed reduction in the BLA network.
In line with this hypothesis, TNFα and IL-1β, other immune proteins displaying neuromodulatory activity, downstream molecules of CX3CL1 actions in the hippocampus <span class="citation">(Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, were demonstrated to affect specifically PV-expressing neurons in the striatum <span class="citation">(Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
It led to disturbance of network homeostasis manifested as a reduction in GABAergic transmission and abnormal neuronal firing.
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1, probably acting <em>via</em> TNFα- and/or IL-1β-dependent mechanisms, might regulate the activity of PV-expressing interneurons, and thus affecting the excitability of PCs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the external capsule contains mainly cortical fibers <span class="citation">(Mahanty &amp; Sah, 1999)</span>.<!-- inputs from cortex-->

In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits <span class="citation">(Veres <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Accordingly, both types of network mechanisms might be involved when stimulating the external capsule.<!-- this form of synaptic plasticity in the BLA may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar local inhibitory networks.--></p>

Hence, considering the hypothesis that CX3CL1 specifically acts on chandelier cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition of the activity of PV subpopulation in the BLA could prevent this disinhibition, leading to the observed impaired long-term potentiation.<!--poprawić-->

It should be noted that CeL neurons are densely interconnected and they form more synapses between different neuronal subtypes (RS↔︎LF) than those between the same subpopulation (RS↔︎RS and LF↔︎LF) <span class="citation">(Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.

This connectivity pattern supports the presented data.
It can be hypothesized that reducing the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons would lead to the downregulated GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing cells.
Hence, Regular-Spiking neurons form more dense and potent synapses onto local, different subpopulations of neurons, e.i., Late-Firing.
Consistently, the CX3CL1-modulated reduction of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons should be more prominent than onto Regular-Spiking cells.</p>
<p>Altogether, this study illustrated that CX3CL1 led to decreased activity in both pyramidal-like cells in the BLA as well as Regular-Spiking neurons in the CeL.
However, while principal cells displayed CX3CL1-mediated elevated threshold current, the lowered gain was observed in Regular-Spiking neurons.
<!-- these effects were a result of different parameters (decreased threshold current in the BLA vs. decreased number of spikes induced by increasing current injections.-->
Thus, probably different downstream events were involved.
In line with this, altered membrane properties of Regular-Spiking cells were observed following CX3CL1 treatment.
It might, therefore, be conceivable that these membrane changes are associated with the direct activation of CX3CR1 expressed in Regular-Spiking neurons.
The possible candidate is the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of HCN channels in Regular-Spiking cells.
On the contrary, in the BLA, no membrane changes were observed following the CX3CL1 application.
Considering the increased threshold current in BLA PCs, the impaired LTP, and concomitantly decreased frequency of sIPSCs, the CX3CL1 effects on the PV subpopulation of interneurons is speculated.
However, those hypotheses need to be further verified.<!--PLA, single cell -->

<p>When discussing potential mechanisms of neuromodulatory actions of the CX3CL1, the controversy regarding the localization of its receptor, CX3CR1, should be acknowledged.
While some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 on microglia <span class="citation">(Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Cardona <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>, several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and DRN neurons <span class="citation">(Maciejewski-Lenoir <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Hatori <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Verge <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Zhuang <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya <em>et al.</em>, 2012, 2014; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018)</span>.<!--+ nowsze-->
Here, our immunohistological data from both brain slices and cultured neurons also suggest that CX3CR1 is present on neurons in the amygdala.
Notably, the data presented here do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons, and the possibility that these electrophysiological effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>In the past decade, new research has emerged providing evidence and insight into the functions of microglia.
Briefly, those cells are crucial in refining the neuronal network both under physiological and pathological conditions either directly through physical contacts with neurons, by releasing signaling molecules <span class="citation">(Wake <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Tremblay <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span><!--jeszcze wydzielanie--> or indirectly <em>via</em> interactions with astrocytes <span class="citation">(Liddelow <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.

Given that only microglial cells were identified to express GFP in these mice, all studies using this strain strengthen the notion of a microglial-specific CX3CR1 expression.

<p>Therefore, to identify the involvement of microglia in CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulatory effects observed in this study, a subset of slices was pre-applied with minocycline, which is commonly used to inhibit microglial activation, including in electrophysiological studies (for example: <span class="citation">Scianni <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>).</p>
<p>The CX3CL1-mediated downregulation of GABAergic transmission and elevated threshold current in principal cells in the BLA were not observed when minocycline was pre-applied, suggesting that microglia may be involved in this process.<!-- However, regardless of the presence of minocycline, the same proportion of neurons were responsive to CX3CL1(2nM), suggesting that microglia might not be involved in this process (see Fig \@ref(fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall) in Appendix \@ref(CX3CL1sEPSCappendix)).-->
Interestingly, minocycline applied alone was shown to facilitate principal cells’ firing and affect the kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.
A similar situation was observed in CeL, where Late-Firing neurons were more excitable following minocycline incubation.

Moreover, when both minocycline and CX3CL1 were present, neither the CX3CL1- nor the minocycline-mediated effects were observed, suggesting opposing actions of those molecules in the amygdala.<!--raises the interesting possibility. /// there is a possibility that the mechanisms underlying CX3CL1-mediated increase in threshold current and minocycline-induced actions on glutamatergic transmission and principal-cells activity are independent. // Regardless of the cellular site of this minocycline-induced glutamatergic enhancement, -->
This idea is further supported by a recent study by <span class="citation">Yuan <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span>, in which they inhibited or activated microglia by infusion into CeA either minocycline or CX3CL1, respectively, and exerted opposite effects on visceral hypersensitivity.<!-- WAS-induced changes in microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in the CeA, and visceral hypersensitivity were reversed by minocycline whereas in stress-naïve rats, fractalkine induced microglial deramification and visceral hypersensitivity.--><!--dodatkowo : PKCdelta - enkefalin - pain -->
However, it should be mentioned that minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that has powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties, which has some other unrelated effects, including direct action on neurons.
Thus, the findings presented in this study do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons or complete inhibition of microglial activity by minocycline.
Therefore, the possibility that the observed effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia or/and direct minocycline actions on neurons cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that CX3CL1 was bath-applied onto BLA neurons after the minocycline-induced upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity.
Hence, CX3CL1 might eliminate this minocycline-induced enhancement of glutamatergic drive, supporting the hypothesis that CX3CL1 action depends on the initial state of the network and restoring the disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance <span class="citation">(Bertollini <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.<!-- there is a possibility that the CX3CL1 treatment abolished prior minocycline-mediated elevated excitability of pyramidal-like neurons independently on CX3CR1 activation instead of elimination of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on neuronal firing by minocycline.-->
This idea is consistent with the observed complex actions of CX3CL1 on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA: CX3CL1 was shown to decrease the frequency of sEPSC mainly onto BLA neurons with higher frequency during baseline, especially at the concentration of 5nM.
In accordance with our data, studies from another group demonstrated the TTX-sensitive modulation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synaptic transmission by CX3CL1, supporting their actions at the network level <span class="citation">(Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009)</span>.
Finally, the potential role in maintaining the E/I balance, along with a TTX-sensitive modulation of synaptic transmission, was also proposed to other chemokines and cytokines, including IL-1β and TNFα <span class="citation">(Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, suggesting a similar action of immune proteins in the brain physiology.<!-- (citations) --><!--In line with the hypothesis - homeostasis synaptic scaling - there is possibility that, regardless of the mechanism of minocycline-induced increase in PCs' excitability, the lack of observed effects when CX3CL1 is added to pre-applied minocycline is its "normalizing" action.CX3CL1 could decreased the previously elevated PCs' firing as well as kinetics of sEPSCThese issues findings are hard to interpret, especially when ....inspecific many explanations--></p>

<!-- zmienić
Interestingly, by modulating the expression levels and surface diffusion of glutamate transporters, astrocytes influence synaptic transmission by controlling the glutamate spillover beyond the synapse. 
Such glutamate spillover can activate extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (Huang et al., 2004), which shape the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Murphy-Royal et al., 2015). 
Hence, changes in EPSCs have important effects on the local and temporal integration of synaptic inputs by neuronal networks, and consequently on synaptic plasticity. 
Therefore, glutamate transporters not only support synaptic homeostasis, but also contribute, at least in part, to plasticity processes at the synaptic levels (reviewed by Rose et al., 2017). <!-- analogous - microglia? we have changes in RT and DT after minocycline application-->
<!--glial impact?
By releasing glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, among others, astrocytes control the basal tone of synaptic activity and the threshold for synaptic plasticity
Astrocytes may also indirectly participate in inducing LTP by microglia by cognition by releasing CCR5 ligands that act on and recruit CCR5-expressing microglia to neighboring neurons, after which the microglia engage in functions related to synaptic remodeling and modulation. 
Although the exact mechanism of CCR5-regulated microglial pruning remains unknown, microglial CCR5 is well-positioned to contribute to synaptic plasticity and resultant regulation of cognitive function.-->

Activation of microglia is associated with  increased release of IL-1  β  and TNF-  α  ,both of which promote hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony via transcriptional or post-transcription  al mechanisms [33, 46].

For instance, minocycline inhibited Na+ currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells ( Kim et al., 2011 ), suppressed Na+ and Ca2+ currents in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ), and reduced evoked synaptic currents ( Cho et al., 2006 ) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents ( Liu et al., 2015 ) in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons.

We found that minocycline largely enhances the frequency,  but  not  the  amplitude,  of  inhibitory postsynaptic   currents   (IPSCs), 


For example, minocycline (50 nM) had no effect on basal excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 ( Pascual et al., 2012 )  or SG neurons ( Berta et al., 2014 ); however, 100 l M minocycline  may  inhibit  dorsal  root  entry  zone stimulation-elicited EPSCs in SG neurons ( Cho et al., 2006 ) or may decrease sEPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons ( Gonzalez et al., 2007 ). At a concentration of 200 l M, minocycline may decrease C-fiber evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). In addition, minocycline at 500 l M abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons ( Itoh et al., 2011 ).-->
<p>To sum up, although the underlying cellular mechanisms and the possible regulation of local neuron-glia communication in the amygdala is still largely unknown, this study has shown that both CX3CL1 and minocycline modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala.<!-- ładniej.... --->
Yet, the presented findings do not exclude the CX3CL1 modulation on neurons and their action in an autocrine manner or direct minocycline action on neuronal cells.
However, considering the reported abundance of CX3CR1 expression in microglial cells, along with growing recognition of microglial cells, especially microglia-neuron crosstalk, in the regulation of brain functions under physiological conditions, this scenario is unlikely.
Hence, considering all these issues, the microglial contribution to the observed CX3CL1-mediated effect strongly warrants further investigation.<!--Thus, these findings warrant further investigation, for example by using opto- or chemogenetic activation of those cells.lepiej napisać-->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala</h2>
<p>Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect principal cells’ excitability, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were observed.
In particular, presented results indicated that following CXCL12 nonsignificantly increased excitability of principal cells (especially at a higher concentration), modulated the excitatory synaptic transmission, and induced opposing changes in the frequency of sIPSCs depending on the chemokine concentration.
<!-- The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is in line with a previous report demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus of the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a], at least considering sensitivity and the detection level needed for *in situ* hybridization 20 years ago. nienajlepsze zdanie--></p>
<p>CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation <span class="citation">(Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Nevertheless, it demonstrated neuronal expression of the CXCR4 receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA under physiological conditions.
The authors further suggested that the latter effect might lead to the increased excitability of pyramidal-like neurons.<!-- However, these results are in contrast with studies conducted by , revealing that CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.-->
Their hypothesis is supported by the results presented in this PhD dissertation.
However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward.
In particular, the study by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> revealed that the application of CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.
In contrast, results presented here showed that CXCL12(2nM) enhanced sEPSC frequency in 2 out of 12 neurons, while reducing this parameter in 5 out of 12 cells.
Thus, grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs.
These neuronal proportions were also similar when a higher concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied.
Different experimental settings may explain this discrepancy between studies.
First, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using slices obtained from male Wistar rats.
The difference between those animals was reported in many contexts <span class="citation">(Asan <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Northcutt <em>et al.</em>, 2007)</span>.<!-- lepiej napisać--></p>
<p>Moreover, while the present study was performed on the coronal slices, transverse slices containing the amygdala were used in the study by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>.
Accordingly, the entorhinal, perirhinal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala are heavily interconnected and implicated in memory; most of the connections known from <em>in vivo</em> studies were preserved in the horizontal slices <span class="citation">(Halbach &amp; Albrecht, 2002)</span>.
Given that those connections are excitatory, it raises the possibility that the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices might be, at least in part, due to more preserved and dense connections between those crucial structures, which were absent from coronal slices.<!-- The present study increases our understanding of which hippocampal pathways are best preserved in the three most common brain slice preparations, and will help investigators determine the appropriate slices to use for physiological studies depending on the subregion of interest.-->
<!--The temperature, which is the critical factor for recording the synaptic transmission, also differs between these two studies.
Here, brain slices were submerged with the ACSF at the temperature of 31–33°C, whereas the excitatory synaptic transmission in experiments by @yang_2016 was recorded at room temperature.potwierdzenie--></p>
<p>Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF, <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a blocker of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, picrotoxin.
Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> study was distorted by the modulation of the GABAergic heterogeneous group of local interneurons.
Given the well-known tight regulation of principal cell activity by local interneurons (for a review: <span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>), along with documented CXCL12 mediation of GABAergic transmission (for a review: <span class="citation">Guyon (2014)</span>), this explanation is possible.
<!-- jeszcze coś o excitability?-->
Nevertheless, whether blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors will result in a significant CXCL12-mediated increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the BLA and/or enhancing their firing in rat coronal acute slices needs further studies.</p>
<p>In line with this hypothesis, there is a trend in the CXCL12-triggered changes in the frequency of sIPSC, although not statistically significant.<!--lepiej napisać-->
Specifically, bath administration of CXCL12 produced two distinct responses: while exogenous CXCL12 at the concentration of 2nM was shown to reduce the frequency of sIPSC, the increased number of these events were observed following treatment with a higher concentration of this chemokine (5nM).<!--bath administration of serotonin (0.3–100 μM) produced two distinct responses which could be differentiated physiologically and pharmacologically--></p>
<p>These observations are in good agreement with what happens in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA), where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects depending on the concentration used <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.<!-- nie wiem czy bardziej nie zmienić...

This can be paralleled to what happens in MCH neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, where SDF-1α also exerts opposite effects on the action potential discharge depending on the concentration (Guyon et al. 2005b). Moreover, this can also be observed in other contexts, for example, low levels of SDF-1 (<100 ng/ml) are attractive, whereas higher levels (>1 μg/ml) are repulsive for T cells (Zlatopolskiy & Laurence 2001).

Specifically, CXCL12 at 0.1-1 nM decreased peak and discharge frequency of action potential evoked by current pulses, whereas at the concentration of 10nM, CXCL12 induced the opposite actions.

<p>In addition, CXCL12 was shown to be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment.

Notably, considering that no CXCR4-expressing astrocytes were observed in the BLA <span class="citation">(Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, together with the known expression of CXCR4 in microglial cells <span class="citation">(Tanabe <em>et al.</em>, 1997)</span>, it might be conceivable that the concentration needed to activate CXCR4 on microglial might be different from neuronal cells.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to CXCR4, CXCL12 is known to act through another atypical receptor, ACKR3 <span class="citation">(Levoye <em>et al.</em>, 2009)</span>.
Recently, increasing evidence has shown the ACKR3-modulated action of CXCL12 in many brain structures <span class="citation">(Puchert <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Fumagalli <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Meyrath <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.<!--rozwinąć ? including? -->
Nevertheless, to date, no ACKR3 has been detected in the amygdala <span class="citation">(Schönemeier <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>, suggesting that this explanation is unlikely.</p>

Nevertheless, this study raises the possibility that CXCL12 might modulate the local inhibitory synaptic transmission in the BLA in an opposing manner depending on the concentration used.

First, CXCL12 was shown to modulate the excitability of CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably without the astrocytic involvement.
Moreover, the frequency of excitatory synaptic currents was increased at the higher concentration (5nM) only in the Regular-Spiking cells.

This phenomenon was previously reported in granule neurons precursors in the DG by using pharmacological, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological approaches <span class="citation">(Stumm <em>et al.</em>, 2002, 2003; Bhattacharyya <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Kolodziej <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.<!--by @kolodziej_2008, where intraventricular infusion of AMD3100 dramatically increased CXCR4 protein expression in subgranular neurons in the DG, suggesting that CXCR4 is tonically activated and downregulated by endogenous CXCL12./// While Cxcr4 is silenced in most differentiated cells, its expression persists in the SGZ. 
CXCL12 is postnatally upregulated in mature granule neurons and pharmacological, immunohistochemical as well as electrophysiological approaches suggest that CXCR4 is tonically activated in granule neuron precursors by local CXCL12 (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Berger et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008; Kolodziej et al., 2008; Choe and Pleasure, 2012).-->
The own effects of AMD3100 when applied alone were also observed in MCH neurons in the LHA <span class="citation">(Eggermann <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>, where the CXCR4 was suggested to be tonically inhibited, resulting in the hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions<!--, as compared to CXCR4-derived orexin neurons in the LHA--> <span class="citation">(Eggermann <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.<!-- Low concentrations of CXCL12 exert a tonic inhibition on MCH neurons, which are known to have a hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions, as compared to orexin neurons of the LHA which are in intrinsic state of membrane depolarization and lack CXCR4 expression (Eggermann et al., 2003). In addition, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 has its own effects when applied alone which suggests that a tonic activation of CXCR4 occurs, at least in slices preparations, and that low levels of CXCL12 are secreted under basal conditions (although the slice preparation could also be considered as an inflammatory state).[@guyon_2014]--><!--Given that tonic activation of CXCR4 by SDF1 leads to internalization of both chemokine and receptor (Burger and Kipps, 2006), it is entirely possible that the constitutive release of neuronal SDF1 and subsequent neuronal signaling via CXCR4 may result in diminished evidence of CXCR4-IR in the sensory ganglia of morphine treated rats (Fig. 6C). This event would not be unlike previous reports in the dentate gyrus (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008, Kolodziej et al., 2008).--></p>
<!--However, increased excitability is documented to results either from increasing amplitude of N-type calcium channel or inducing inward rectifier (GIRK) potassium currents, the action mediated by CXC12/CXCR4 axis. zmienić, citation-->
<!--GIRK or N-type calcium channel in CeA neurons?-->
<!--The activation of the GIRK current could have been mediated directly through CXCR4 activation or through the activation of metabotropic glutamate and ⁄ or GABAB receptors, as SDF-1 a increases glutamate and GABA release in the slice. GIRK current in the amygdala? GABA B in the amygdala?? 
Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.
In conclusion, the SDF-1 a -induced hyperpolarization is likely linked to the activation of a GIRK current via stimulation of CXCR4

<p>Moreover, the pre-incubation slices with an astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, did not abolish the CXCL12-triggered increase in neuronal excitability, suggesting that astrocytes did not mediate this effect.
This raises the possibility that similar to the BLA and the SN <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, astrocytes in the CeA might also lack the CXCR4 receptors.
However, further studies employing immunostaining methods are necessary to verify this hypothesis.
<!--This is in line with presented immunofluorescence data demonstrating the absence of CXCR4 in astrocytes. pokazuje? ;/ --></p>
<p>Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, a complex trend was observed.
<!-- może tutaj zdanie o tym że działa na transmisję w innych strukturach? patrz niżej ale nie wiem jakie efekty -->
At 2nM, CXCL12 was shown to reduce the frequency of sEPSC onto more than 50% of Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the elevated frequency of sEPSC was observed during 5nM CXCL12 treatment.<!--POPRAWIĆ-->
Moreover, this effect was prominent in Regular-Spiking neurons, while no relevant differences in the excitatory synaptic transmission were observed onto Late-Firing cells.
<!-- As documented previously, CXCL12 was revealed to increase glutamate release in the cerebellum and hypothalamus [@guyon_2005; @ragozzino_1998].-->
This is in line with a study showing that PVT neurons preferentially innervated SOM-positive neurons in CeL <span class="citation">(Penzo <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, which is in good agreement with the observed enhancement of excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons.<!--poprawić i cytowanie // PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM+ neurons in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM+ neuron activity and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear learning and expression5,6-->
Since the higher concentration of CXCL12 showed a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that their elevated activity is reflected by upregulated excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons.
Although BLA direct glutamatergic projections to CeL have been well-established <span class="citation">(Krettek &amp; Price, 1978; Pitkänen <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>, differences in the type of their target neurons remain unclear.<!-- może nie unclear..... prefer Regular-Spiking or SOM-expressing neurons -->
However, given the anxiolytic effect of optogenetic stimulation of the BLA→CeL pathway <span class="citation">(Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, the cell type-specific differences have been speculated <span class="citation">(Fadok <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.<!--Because optogenetic stimulation of the pathway between the BLA and CEl can also have anxiolytic effects [ 12 ], it could be that glutamatergic BLA inputs to the CEl target different cell types, and that depending on stimulation parameters, different behavioral responses could be induced-->
Of note, principal cells were reported to preferentially innervate Late-Firing neurons in the baseline condition, whereas following fear-conditioning, this pattern changes <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Given that intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 impaired the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear response <span class="citation">(Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, we speculate that CXCL12 might be involved in this process.</p>
<!--relevance fear
BLA can influence CEm via direct glutamatergic projections9,10,11,16 and through indirect di-synaptic routes involving the glutamatergic excitation of GABAergic intercalated (ITC)16 or central lateral (CEl) neurons9,10,11 that project to CEm10,11,16,17.///
Specifically, fear conditioning strengthens excitatory synapses onto neurons expressing the peptide hormone somatostatin(SOM+)/PKCd  neurons, which largely correspond to CeLONunits, while weakening those synapsing onto SOM  /PKC d + neurons in the CeL, which largely correspond to CeLOFFunits.-->
<!--It has been suggested that in the context of fear conditioning, CeL~ON~ cells (mostly Regular-Firing cells), like CeM neurons, receives direct excitatory inputs from auditory cortex [@ciocchi_2010].(+ linke_2000) // The short onset latency of CS-evoked excitation in CElon neurons (<15ms) indicates that they may, like CEm neurons22,23, receive direct input from sensory thalamus24.-->
<!-- Guyon_2006
Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12. However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12. 
It is therefore likely that CXCL12 induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). 
Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. 
The mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.-->
<p>Since CeL neurons are highly interconnected, one could speculate that the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Spiking cells and elevated excitability would lead to more increased GABAergic transmission within CeL.<!--lepiej napisać, ale tak -->
In contrast, at the concentration of 5nM, the median frequency of sIPSCs is increased in the Regular-Spiking cells, whereas Late-Firing cells were shown to display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs.
All of these effects were mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in the presence of AMD3100.
In addition, these observations were also absent in the presence of TTX and an astrocytic toxin.
A similar dual effect on GABAergic transmission in the CeL was described for another immune protein, IL-1β <span class="citation">(Bajo <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
These observations suggest that the CXCL12-mediated actions on GABAergic transmission are multifaceted, which might be a common characteristic among immune proteins.<!--lepiej napisać -->
The elimination of these effects in the presence of astrocytic toxin or TTX strongly suggests that they are modulated by both the GABAergic and astrocytic networks.
The mechanisms of astrocytic modulation of the CeL microcircuit have recently attracted much attention <span class="citation">(Martin-Fernandez <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Fan <em>et al.</em>, 2021; Wahis <em>et al.</em>, 2021)</span>.<!--rozwinąć -->
It would, then, be interesting to test whether the CXCL12 application led to opposing effects in those two subpopulations in the CeL by using dual patch-clamp experiments.
It is especially of high importance as the impairment of fear acquisition and extinction induced by intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 was reported to be eliminated in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors <span class="citation">(Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, highlighting the link between GABAergic system and CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in mediating fear-conditioning.</p>
<!-- It would, then, be interesting to test if astrocytes are important to OT  signaling in other brain regions, and, if they are, if the same mechanisms of astrocyte-to-neuron communication are at stake.-->
<!-- Maybe only neuronal CXCR4 activity is tonic.
However, it is important to note that if only astrocytes were involved in this effect.
Noting that this effect was sensitive to TTX, it -->
<!--As mentioned previously, CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->
<!-- Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity [@murphyroyal_2015].

In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity [@perea_2016], or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength [@covelo_2018]. -->
<!-- Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells *via* ATP signaling [@chever_2014]. 
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium [@meunier_2017].

It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 [@meyrath_2020].
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis. -->
<!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.-->
<!-- analogous // Moreover, although the results of the present study add another piece to the growing body of evidence that ACKR3 is unable to trigger G protein signaling, it cannot be excluded that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 could induce G protein-dependent or -independent signaling [@heuninck_2019]. // oreover, although several studies did not detect ACKR3 receptor in the amygdala, it cannot be excluded that, in certain cell types or cellular contexts, ACKR3 could, at least partially, mediate observed here effects of CXCL12.-->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Limitations</h2>
<p>A few limitations in the presented study should be acknowledged. <!-- This  approach  was  preferred in this instance to more approximate recording conditions.-->
<!-- First, using immunofluorescence to localize receptors is pretty difficult and thus sometimes leads to inconclusive data. 
Therefore, results from these studies should be treated as preliminary results, and more sensitive methods should be used, such as RNA-scope [@kharchenko_2021] or RNA-sequencing transcriptome [@zhang_2014].due to technical/methodological implication of difficulties regarding immunofluorescent stainings of receptors and imperfections of many antibodies, the results concerning co-localization needs to be verified by using more sensitive methods, such as RNA-scope or .... -->
The presented results reveal that both chemokines mainly modulated the amygdala’s neuronal firing and/or GABAergic transmission.
It should be noted that during whole-cell patch-clamp recording, the cytoplasm of recorded neurons is dialyzing with an intrapipette solution.
Thus, it might affect intracellular signaling machinery, and thereby, affect cellular excitability.<!-- Soluble components that influence cellular excitability and contribute to signaling pathways are dialyzed from the cell. One frequently encountered consequence is that receptor-mediated responses and/or ionic currents that require soluble second messengers are absent or rapidly “run down” during conventional whole-cell recordings (3, 4). Furthermore, intracellular ion concentrations are disrupted, hampering efforts to determine physiologically relevant responses or properties of channels and receptors (5, 6).-->
A gramicidin perforated patch technique would be a better option to avoid this issue, as it maintains a relatively intact intracellular milieu <span class="citation">(Akaike &amp; Harata, 1994; Akaike, 1996)</span>.
Nevertheless, this should not affect presented results, as the reported effects are eliminated in the pre-incubation with blockers of receptors, suggesting that they are specific.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the lack of prominent effects on excitatory synaptic transmission by chosen chemokines despite observed tendencies might be related to the use of coronal slices instead of horizontal sections.<!-- plane-->
Thus, the hippocampal and cortex connections, which are essential inputs to the amygdala, are absent in the coronal slices used in this study.<!--citations--></p>
<p>Finally, although widely used, the pharmacological inhibition of either microglia or astrocytes might not be highly specific.
Further dissection of local communication between astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the context of chemokines’ modulation will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions.
The optogenetic technique allows for precise temporal (e.g., milliseconds) and spatial (e.g., specific cell types) light activation, thereby modulating cellular excitability, highlighting specificity and bidirectionally.<!-- Light activation of these proteins modulates cellular excitability with millisecond precision. //  Comparison of electrical and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, highlighting cellular specificity and bidirectionality of optogenetic techniques// The exact dissection of these parallel actions will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions.
