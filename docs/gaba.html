<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> GABA</h1>
<p>Three types of GABA receptors, two ligand-gated channels, GABAAand GABAC, and one metabotropic, GABAB, have been described to date (Chebib and Johnston 1999). The selective GABAAantagonist bicuculline fully abolished the GABA response in our system, indicating that it was mediated through GABAAionotropic receptors. As expected from an ionotropic response, the effect of GABA was fasttriggered (100 ms) in our model. Interestingly, MCP1/CCL2 inhibition of the GABA response was observed following concomitant application of the chemokine and the neurotransmitter, indicating that it took less than 100 ms for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. Such a fast event suggests that the classical G protein-mediated signalling cascades associated with GPCR activation were not operated by MCP1/CCL2. This hypothesis is further supported by our observation that GTP was not required in the intracellular medium for MCP1/CCL2 to produce its effect. One possible explanation that might account for such a fast GTPindependent MCP1/CCL2 effect, as observed here, might be that CCR2 activation by its agonist ligand resulted in an inhibition of GABAAreceptor activity through direct receptor–receptor interactions. There are some examples in the literature of such interactions between GPCRs and ionotropic receptors (Liu et al . 2000; Lee et al . 2002; Fiorentini et al . 2003). Further studies that combine biochemical, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches are needed to test this intriguing hypothesis. GABA plays a major role in spinal cord physiology as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). One classical function exerted by GABA is its participation in the inhibitory modulation of somatosensory transmission, including nociception (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). In particular, the blockade of spinal GABAAreceptors has been shown to cause hyperalgesia and lead to tactile allodynia in the rat (Malan et al . 2002). This consideration might shed some light on the physiological relevance of the present findings. Indeed, a sizeable number of studies reporting the facilitation of either inflammatory or neuropathic pain by chemokines is now available (Boddeke 2001). Thus, numerous chemokines, including MCP-1/CCL2, have been shown to elicit transient Ca2+currents in dorsal root ganglion neurones (Oh et al . 2001). Moreover, MCP-1/ CCL2 and other chemokines have been shown to crossdesensitize opioid receptors in both dorsal root ganglion and periaqueducal grey matter neurones (Szabo et al . 2002; Zhang et al . 2004). More to the point, MCP-1/CCL2 has been shown to induce mechanical allodynia after intrathecal administration (Tanaka et al . 2004), acting in this regard like a GABAAreceptor antagonist (Malan et al . 2002). Finally, the involvement of MCP-1/CCL2 in pain is strongly supported by the recent observation that mice lacking the CCR2 receptor were markedly less sensitive to noxious stimuli in models of neuropathic pain (Abbadie et al . 2003). It is therefore tempting to propose that the potent inhibition of GABA-induced activation of GABAAreceptors by MCP1/ CCL2, as reported here, might be one of the mechanisms by which the chemokine and its receptor, CCR2, facilitate nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level. In accordance with this hypothesis, our autoradiographic results showed a high density of [125I]MCP-1/CCL2 binding sites in areas I–IV of the dorsal horn and in the central cervical nucleus in the cervical cord, two regions known to receive somatosensory input from sensory neurones. As mentioned above, GABA is a wide-spectrum inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and, consequently, its actions spread well beyond the control of pain. It is also implicated in the modulation of other somatosensory spinal inputs and in the membrane excitability of ventral horn motoneurones (Malcangio and Bowery 1996). Our immunolabelling data indicate that CCR2 is constitutively expressed by a majority of spinal neurones. It is therefore likely that MCP-1/CCL2 could act on other neuronal spinal networks to attenuate GABA inhibitory actions in both physiological and pathological situations.</p>
<p>Although DA release and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (cultures vs. slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CXCL12 in both systems.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.0.0.1</span> NMDA</h4>
<p>NMDARs are versatile receptors modulating physiological and pathological activities in the nervous system. They are involved in development, synapse maturation, synaptic transmission and plasticity processes, and their dysfunction has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Hardingham and Bading, 2010; Zhou and Sheng, 2013; Ghasemi et al., 2014). NMDAR stimulation may induce neuronal death (Choi, 1987; Choi et al., 1988; Tymianski et al., 1993) or protection, also through preconditioning (Grabb and Choi, 1999; Navon et al., 2012). <span class="citation">Lauro <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span></p>

<div id="adenosine" class="section level4" number="6.0.0.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.0.0.2</span> adenosine</h4>
<p>Adenosine is a metabolite that acts through different receptor subtypes (Jacobson and Gao, 2006); among them A 1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014) are involved in CX3CL1 neuroprotection against Glu-induced toxicity. Moreover we previously demonstrated that CX3CL1 triggers the release of adenosine from neuronal and microglial cells (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010).
Adenosine (ADO) is a cellular metabolite that is formed by the breakdown of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotides that are physiologically present at nanomolar concentration inside and outside the cells (Fredholm, 2007). It represents an endogenous modulator of brain functions acting to fine-tune inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (Ribeiro et al., 2010), glial function (Boison et al., 2010), and blood flow (Kusano et al., 2010); moreover, in the nervous system, the level of extracellular ADO rises upon brain damage which follows stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures (Ribeiro et al., 2003). Acting through four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), extracellular ADO determines the outcome of different brain injuries, mediating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this regard, we have recently shown that ADO plays a significant role in mediating CX3CL1, BDNF, and erythropoietin-mediated neuroprotection through the activation of A1receptors (Lauro et al., 2008; 2010), and other reports de scribe that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and oncostatin M (OSM) require A1R functions to exert their neuroprotective effects (Biber et al., 2008; Moidunny et al., 2010). <span class="citation">(Rosito <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span></p>
<p>In the brain, astrocytes represent the main cellular source of extracellular ADO and express all the four known types of adenosine receptors (ARs): A1R, A2AR, A2BR, A3R (Verkhratsky et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Adenosine exerts two parallel modulatory roles in the CNS, acting as a homeostatic modulator and also as a neuromodulator at the synaptic level. <span class="citation">(Cunha, 2001)</span></p>

<p>LTP in amygdala is predominantly regulated by glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors, and is considered to be a form of synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory in the hippocampus.8 <!-- trochę bardziej zmienić --> Activation of CX3CR1 on microglia within the CA1 region of the hippocampus triggers the release of adenosine that in turn, via the activation of type A2 adenosine recep-tors, increases the release of D- serine as a coagonist for NMDA receptors from the glia, leading to a potentiation of NMDA function, suggesting that fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling may enhance LTP as well as learning and memory processes.37
On the other hand, CX3CR1- deficient mice exhibit impaired LTP in the hippocampus.20 <!-- These findings suggest that the cognitive impairment observed in DIO mice may be due to decreased fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the hippocampus.--></p>
<!-- CX3CL1 and NMDA, AMPA, PSD etc.

A recent study demonstrated that the detrimental effects of HFD consumption on learning and memory may be mediated in part by the alterations of glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors.3 4 40–42 HFD feeding decreases hippocampal NR2B of NMDA receptor subunits and GluR-1 of AMPA receptor subunits.43 44 The present study also demonstrated a significant decrease in NR1, NR2A and GluR1 in the hippocampus of DIO mice. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that CX3CR1 antagonist- treated mice also exhibited a significant decrease in NR2A and GluR1 in the hippocampus coincident with significant cognitive deficits, similar to DIO mice. Presynaptic and postsynaptic machinery asso-ciated with synapse formation and activity is involved in learning and memory processes. Compared with control mice, DIO mice exhibit abnormal expression of factors involved in the synaptic plasticity, such as synaptosomal- associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and synaptophysin I in the presynaptic site and PSD-95 in the postsynaptic site.5 6 9 10 14 43 HFD- fed animals exhibit cognitive decline in a water maze test and step- through task, and a decrease in synapsin 1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus and cere-bral cortex.3 14 Further, HFD- fed mice display impaired hippocampal- dependent memory in the Y- maze test, and reduced SNAP-25, PSD-95 and syntaxin-4, but not synap-tophysin, in the hippocampus.6 In the present study, DIO mice exhibited a significant decrease in synaptophysin and PSD-95 levels in the hippocampus compared with CD mice. Synaptophysin is presynaptic vesicle marker, and PSD-95 interacts with ion channels, membrane receptors, cytoskeletal components, and intracellular signaling molecules,45 46 and increases AMPA receptor currents by selectively delivering GluR1- containing receptors to synapses, thus mimicking LTP.47 These findings suggest that the synaptic dysfunction might be an important contributor to the hippocampal- dependent spatial memory impairment in DIO mice.6 Furthermore, in the present study, the administration of a CX3CR1 antagonist induced a significant decrease in PSD-95 in the hippocampus of normal mice compared with vehicle- treated mice, the same changes observed in the hippo-campus of DIO mice. Moreover, the same changes in the NMDA receptor subunits, AMPA receptor subunits, and synaptic markers were observed in both DIO mice and CX3CR1 antagonist- treated mice, indicating that HFD feeding induced impaired fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the hippocampus, leading to synaptic deterioration and resulting in impaired cognition

<!-- CX3CL1 and inflammation and microglia 

There is convincing evidence that enhanced inflamma-tion in both the brain and peripheral organs is strongly involved in several dysfunctions associated with HFD feeding for a long time.48 In this regard, fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling is demonstrated to regulate the inflam-matory responses of macrophage and microglia.20 49 50 Especially, enhanced inflammation in both the brain and peripheral organs induced by HFD feeding has been reported to influence cognitive function.20 31 49 50 Therefore, enhanced inflammation may be an another pivotal event to regulate processing of learning and memory in obesity.

-->
<p>The present study revealed that long- term HFD feeding in mice may induce impaired fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling in the corticolimbic system, leading to defec-tive synaptic plasticity and subsequently to cognitive impairment in DIO mice. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that neuron–microglia interactions, especially those underpinned by fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling, play crucial roles in brain dysfunction associated with obesity.</p>
<p>Therefore, fractalkine- CX3CR1 signaling is postulated to represent a primary neuron–glia inter- regulatory system that is important for brain function.18</p>
<p>We have previously shown that another transmembrane chemokine, CX3CL1, in duces protection of hippocampal neurons from Glu-induced excitotoxicity with a mechanism mediated by microglia (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). <!-- opposite -->
the inhibition of microglia activation selectively prevented CX3CL1-induced neuroprotection, while CXCL16 was still able to rescue neurons from cell death (Fig. 4 A , n 4–5; p 0.05) indicating that microglia activation is not required for CXCL16-mediated neuroprotection.</p>
<p>In this study, the identity (that is, ON or OFF cell, PKCδ+ or PKCδ−) of the CeL neurons activated by BLA terminal optical stimulation was not determined.</p>
<p>Further work is required to determine whether the spiny and aspiny interneurons characterized in this study correspond to BLA interneurons expressing specific markers, such as PV, CB, or somatostatin, or have different innervation targets. <!-- analogous --></p>
<p>Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and synaptic currents caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) (Bellingham and Berger 1996; Doze et al. 1991), sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity, and both factors are permissively limited by the number of inhibitory synapses. <!--klenowski_2015--></p>
<p>We believe that our technique is well suited to investigate changes in BLA morphology and activity, which have been implicated in a number of disease states, including posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction (Koob et al. 2014; Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). Posttraumatic stress disorder and other forms of chronic stress are often associated with increases in amygdala activity, resulting in the dysregulation of fear responses and causing sensitization to stressful stimuli (Mahan and Ressler 2012; Roozendaal et al. 2009). Previous studies have shown that emotional responses generated by the BLA may result from increased excitatory input and changes in glutamate receptor ratios (Christian et al. 2012; Hubert et al. 2014; LeDoux 2003) and repeated restraint stress can cause changes in BLA spine localization (Padival et al. 2013). It would be interesting to investigate whether these changes result from altered levels of not only excitatory input but also inhibitory synapses within the BLA and other nuclei within the amygdala. <!-- klenowski_2015--></p>
<p>Because a large majority of the inhibitory signaling within the BLA is provided by locally projecting interneurons, one would expect reductions in interneuron synaptic number and/or activity to have a profound effect on the excitatory output of this region. Inhibitory synaptic plasticity has previously been demonstrated within the BLA (Szinyei et al. 2007), and reduced GABAergic activity facilitates long-term potentiation of thalamic input to the lateral amygdala (Bissiere et al. 2003). The use of the methodology described here combined with rodent models of fear conditioning, chronic stress, and drug addiction will allow further investigations to uncover whether such phenomena are accompanied by changes in morphology and inhibitory synaptic connectivity.</p>
<p>Finally, in comparison to other reasonably well-understood brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, the amygdaloid nuclei do not show a rigid organization of its neuronal elements. Cells are not organized into layers nor do they have the striking preferred orientation of their major output neurons as described in these other brain regions. Thus it is not surprising that input-output mechanisms in the LA are regulated by the various ionic conductances in the membranes of their major output neurons rather than through mechanisms that rely on architectonics and differences in cell morphology. <span class="citation">(Faber <em>et al.</em>, 2001)</span></p>
<p>Feng et al. found another potential therapy for regulate stress is motilin which can weaken anxiety-like behavior in rats after they have been subjected to forced swimming. Whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices revealed that motilin depolarized the interneurons and promoted GABAergic transmission in the BLA (Feng et al., 2013).</p>
<p>In rats subjected to restraint stress, acute application of corticotropin releasing factor significantly increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the CeA (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the HPA axis can mediate the stress response because it is a neuroendocrine system. Some researchers looked at the effects of rapid glucocorticoid-induced acute stress in the rat BLA. Glucocorticoid administrated to amygdala slices produced a rapid, non-reversible suppression of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents (Di et al., 2016). The acute administration of glucocorticoid receptor agonist DEX also upregulated GABA release and GABAergic neuronal spiking (Wang et al., 2016).</p>

<p>Rats subjected to repeated corticosterone administration showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior, examined using the open field test. The behavioral effects caused by corticosterone injections may because of increased expression of c-Fos in the LA and CeA nuclei of the amygdala and decreased GABAA a -2 subunit density in the CeA of these rats (Skórzewska et al., 2015). These findings are consistent with those of another study (Lussier et al., 2013). Liu et al. (2014) suggested that a lasting loss of tonic but not phasic GABAA receptor currents severely contributes to the prolonged amygdala disinhibition observed after chronic stress.</p>

<p>In fact, GABAergic control of the amygdala is mostly relevant to anxiety. Some animal researches have shown that administration of corticosterone into the CeA can induce anxiety-like behavior. This animal model imitate the depressed effect of chronic stress on GABAergic tonic inhibition in LA (Myers et al., 2005).

<p>Usually, a change in the amplitude of mIPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABAAreceptors while a change in the frequency of mIPSCs implicates an altered probability of transmitter release and/or changes in the number of active synapses (De Koninck and Mody, 1994; Otis et al , 1994). The reduction in average amplitude after NF knockdown may result from a decreased frequency of larger events, probably due to a reduction of number of postsynaptic GABAAreceptors (Otis et al , 1994). <span class="citation">(Saha <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span></p>
<p>Moreover, due to its restriction to the AIS, knockdown of NF and the associated reduction in inhibitory inputs may also affect the properties of evoked action potentials. After NF knockdown, the firing rate was significantly reduced and the action potential half-width was increased, while the input resistance was unaltered. The reduced firing rate of neurons could be explained by their hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a depolarized threshold potential, in accordance with Zonta et al (2011). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that AACs can control action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons via their GABAergic inputs, either through changing the action potential threshold, or by shifting the site of origin (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Somogyi et al , 1982; Wefelmeyer et al , 2015; Veres et al , 2014). Accordingly, similar differences in action potential properties as seen after NF knockdown arise by shifting the action potential initiation site to the first node of Ranvier (Clark et al , 2005). Moreover, the reduced firing rate of projection neurons could also contribute to the observed LTP impairment (Cohen et al , 1999). <span class="citation">(Saha <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span> <!-- this paragraph is very analogous --></p>
<p>To investigate BLA-LTP in vivo, we chose the vSub – BLA pathway, which represents the major connection between hippocampus and BLA (Horovitz and Richter-Levin, 2015; Kim et al , 2013; Maren et al , 1995) and is known to be part of the fear conditioning and extinction circuitry (Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2009; Hobin et al, 2006). <span class="citation">(Saha <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span> <!-- analogous - to investigate LTP in the BLA, we chose the stimulation of external pathway, which represents .... --->
While impaired LTP in the vSub – BLA pathway after NF knockdown in the BLA may result from reduced neural excitability, its relation to reduced GABAergic inhibition by NF knockdown appears counterintuitive on first sight. However, it may be related to the fact that previous studies suggested rather excitatory net effects of AACs onto BLA projection neurons (Woodruff et al , 2010).
Monosynaptic vSub – BLA projections exist (Mello et al , 1992), and can recruit projection neurons, but also local interneurons via feed-forward circuits, but the role of AACs remains unclear (Bazelot et al , 2015; Hübner et al , 2014).</p>
<p>However, vSub afferents represent only a minor part of BLA afferents (for example, Canteras et al , 1992) and AACs are also reciprocally connected to projections neurons, suggesting they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al , 2014). Accordingly, vSub – BLA plasticity may be also shaped by intra-amygdalar local inhibitory networks.</p>
<p>Cumulative evidence suggests that different BLA afferents target specific subpopulations of interneurons (Leitermann et al , 2016; McDonald et al , 2011; Unal et al , 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA local networks, which in turn may affect induction of LTP in this structure.
Notably, the input – output curve revealed a trend for increased BLA excitability in the NF1707 knockdown group, which could reflect local network changes that may affect further potentiation. <!-- sprawdzić czy w LTP input output jest jakaś tendencja .... --></p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, only one study addressed the role of such specific changes, demonstrating remodeling of perisomatic synapses in contextual fear extinction (Trouche et al , 2013). <!-- chodzi o konstrukcję zdania ... --></p>
<p>The only interneuron subtype presently described that innervates the AIS are AACs or chandelier cells (Bazelot et al , 2015), and their inputs to the AIS were selectively targeted by NF knockdown in our study.</p>
<p>The brain comprises an excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network that maintains a finely tuned balance of activity critical for normal functioning. Excitatory activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region that plays a central role in emotion and motivational processing, is tightly regulated by a relatively small population of g -aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurons. Disruption in GABAergic inhibition in the BLA can occur when there is a loss of local GABAergic interneurons, an alteration in GABAAreceptor activation, or a dysregulation of mechanisms that modulate BLA GABAergic inhibition. <!-- from review @prager_2016-->
BLA hyperexcitability manifests behaviorally as an increase in anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or development of seizure activity.</p>
<p>A more complete understanding of the intrinsic excitatory/inhibitory circuit balance of the amygdala and how imbalances in inhibitory control contribute to excessive BLA excitability will guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric diseases <!-- ładne conclusion --></p>
<p>The GABAergic inhibitory system is one target of therapeutic treatments to reduce anxiety and maintain homeostasis. For example, benzodiazepines, which allosterically enhance postsynaptic actions of GABA at the inhibitory type A GABA receptor (GABAAreceptor), are one first-line treatment for anxiety (Farb and Ratner, 2014) and seizure disorders. <span class="citation">(Prager <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span></p>
<p>GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission plays a central role in the regulation of amygdala excitability. Pathological disruption of GABAAreceptors causes a disruption of the E/I balance and has been increasingly implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (Deidda et al., 2014).
Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the central nervous system is mediated by the GABAAreceptor, a heteropentameric chloridepermeable, GABA-gated member of the cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. GABAAreceptors are formed from limited combinations of subunits that have diverse structural and functional properties ( a 1–6, ß1–3, g 1–3, d , E , u , and p ; Olsen and Sieghart, 2009).</p>
<p>The composition of GABAAreceptors has been found to be quite diverse because their subunit assembly makes their roles significantly different, depending on the timing of activation and subcellular localization (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Marowsky et al., 2004).
The BLA of mature animals contains a 1 and a 2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor; a 1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are expressed primarily at the somal level of PV GABAergic interneurons but also exhibit coimmunoreactivity with the ß2/3 subunits (McDonald and Mascagni, 2004). Alternatively, GABAAreceptors on principal neurons contain primarily the a 2 subunit, which is predominantly responsible for the benzodiazepine allosteric potentiation of inhibitory currents (Marowsky et al., 2004). In addition, principal neurons in the BLA contain g 2 subunits, which likely contribute to the formation of a 2ßx g 2 pentameric GABAAreceptors, which contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Extrasynaptically, the GABAAreceptor in the BLA is made up primarily of the a 3 subunit, which strongly mediates tonic GABAergic currents (Marowsky et al., 2012). However, the a 5 subunit, which is diazepam sensitive and shapes the decay phase of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Marowsky et al., 2004), and the d subunit, both of which are hallmark subunits that contribute to tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005), are also expressed in the BLA, though not as strongly as the a 3 subunit (Marowsky et al., 2012).</p>

 In rat, the development of the mature GABAergic system in the BLA takes place between postnatal day (P) 14 and P30 with the emergence of PV interneurons (Berdel and Morys, 2000; Davila et al., 2008), an increase in the density of GABAergic fibers, and a decrease in the density of GABAergic cell bodies (Brummelte et al., 2007). Concurrently, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) reach maturity between P21 and P28.Simultaneously, the reversal potential of GABAAreceptors expressed in principal neurons shifts from –55 mV at P7 to –70 mV by P21.

These effects could overcome the CXCR4 effects. Further experiments using specific MPP inhibitors should clarify this point.<span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span></p>
<p>Multiple mechanisms may terminate CXCR4 signaling: desensitization, internalization, and degradation, each of which act to guard against inappropriately sustained signaling.Desensitization of CXCR4 and other GPCRs can be either acute or sustained: short-term desensitization spans minutes and results from β-arrestin-mediated steric hinderance of G-protein engagement. Longer term desensitization occurs over hours to days and results from persistent internalization, degradation, and transcriptional downregulation. Following ligand binding, CXCR4 phosphorylation, and G protein recruitment, β-arrestin is recruited to sterically hinder G-protein engagement with the receptor (desensitization).
<!-- raczej nieważne -->
Control over receptor internalization is exerted at the level of ligand binding. Recent studies demonstrate that inverse agonists (TAK779) of CXCR4 stimulate a higher rate of receptor internalization compared to partial agonists (Met-CCL5), suggesting an actively driven internalization process.39 Following internalization, CXCR4 signaling can continue. For example, CXCL12 mediates human neural progenitor cell survival by binding CXCR4 localized to the endosome.40 CXCR4 also localizes to the endosome for degradation which is controlled at several levels
Cytoskeletal activity can link CXCR4 internalization to endosomal degradation. Rho and Gα13 mediate the actin polymerization necessary for trafficking CXCR4 into the endosomal compartment.41 Furthermore, adaptor proteins are necessary for endocytosis: a complex interplay between CXCR4, β-arrestin, and adaptor protein, AP2, is necessary to mediate CXCR4 endocytosis—mechanistic insight is lacking.42 Adaptor proteins are also necessary for CXCR4 recycling, for example, IQGAP1 regulates endosome interactions with microtubules during CXCR4 trafficking back to the cell membrane.43
Whether a receptor is recycled or degraded is largely a function of the overall number of receptors internalized,42 competing cargo for CXCR4-binding motifs42 and the cytoskeleton.43 A network of CXCR4-binding proteins and cytoskeletal processes control CXCR4 signal termination—finer mechanistic insight will provide potential for therapeutic modulation.</p>

Thus, these data suggest that CXCL14 is a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4 that enhances the potency of CXCR4 ligands.</p>
<!-- Complicating these levels of regulation is the fact that overall protein synthesis rates are high in the young brain, decline through adulthood, and fall sharply with old age [13], [56]. Protein turnover in the brain appears to follow a similar pattern [13]; however, little is known about the effects of age on other protein modifications. In addition, proteins such as GFAP show increased metabolic turnover with age, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. Our results are consistent with independent regulation of chemokine expression at the mRNA and post-translational levels.-->
