<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Brief history of chemokines</h3>
<p>Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities.
They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 <span class="citation">(Yoshimura <em>et al.</em>, 1987)</span>.
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 1998)</span>.
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS?
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system <span class="citation">(Williams <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation <em>via</em> their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions, suggesting their brain-specific functions.
Indeed, mounting evidence illustrates that chemokine can act on cellular (e.g., inducing neuroprotective signaling pathways), synaptic (e.g., modulating synaptic transmission), network (e.g., regulating synaptic potentiation), and behavioral levels (e.g., impairing memory; for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)</span>).
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis <span class="citation">(Trettel <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CR1 and CXCR4, as they are widely distributed in the CNS under non-inflammatory, physiological conditions and involved in an increasing array of functions, such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavior <span class="citation">(Réaux-Le Goazigo <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Trettel <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Sowa &amp; Tokarski, 2021)</span>.</p>

<div id="classification" class="section level3" number="1.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Classification, structure, and signaling of the chemokine system</h3>
<p>Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized <span class="citation">(Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018)</span>.
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet on which a C-terminal α-helix is folded (for review: <span class="citation">Miller &amp; Mayo (2017)</span>).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: <span class="citation">Kleist <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs.</p>
<p>Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting “ligand”), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (<span class="citation">Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie (2000)</span>, see Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as α, see Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part a).
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as β, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part b).
C chemokines (also known as γ, see Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part c) are characterized by the presence of only two cysteine residues.
The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part d).</p>

<p>Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs).
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains.
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding.
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R,” which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:family">1.1</a>).
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR <span class="citation">(Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to the G<sub>αi</sub> subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels or G<sub>αq</sub> that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G<sub>11</sub> or G<sub>α12/13</sub>), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)½, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (for reviews: <span class="citation">Allen <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span>, <span class="citation">Rostène, Guyon, <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>).</p>
<p>ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives <span class="citation">(Bachelerie <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Salvi <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>, structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through β-arrestins <span class="citation">(Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018)</span>.
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation <span class="citation">(Nibbs &amp; Graham, 2013; Bachelerie <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Bonecchi &amp; Graham, 2016)</span>.
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: <span class="citation">Salvi <em>et al.</em> (2017)</span>).
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.</p>
<div id="chemokinessignal" class="section level4" number="1.1.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.1</span> Chemokine system expression and signaling</h4>
<p>As chemokines constitute one of the most tightly regulated systems, their signaling is modulated <em>via</em> a broad array of factors, which we are now beginning to appreciate (see for reviews: <span class="citation">Eiger <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span>; <span class="citation">Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018)</span>; <span class="citation">Zweemer <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>).
Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a> illustrates most of these mechanisms, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.
These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications, dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors, dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and biased signaling.</p>
<p>Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (<span class="citation">Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018)</span>, see: Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist <span class="citation">(Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: <span class="citation">Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie (2000)</span>, <span class="citation">Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018)</span>, Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part b).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this section.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules <span class="citation">(Zweemer <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding properties or activating different signaling pathways <span class="citation">(Salanga &amp; Handel, 2011)</span>.
Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs <span class="citation">(Kleist <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Moreover, increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).</p>
<p>GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them.
It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors.
Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression <span class="citation">(Lortat-Jacob, 2009)</span>, along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication.</p>
<p>Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors (<span class="citation">Zweemer <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>, <span class="citation">Kleist <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>, see: Fig <a href="intro.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part d).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished.
Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or β-arrestin, and their downstream elements, according to cell-specific differences.
Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts.
This type of bias is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and β-arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK½ or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.
Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal context.</p>
<p>In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to list a few.
A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms enabling quick response to the dynamic microenvironment with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.</p>

<p>The two members of the chemokine family, i.e., CX3CL1 and CXCL12, have attracted much researchers’ attention due to their wide distribution in the CNS under physiological conditions and involvement in an increasing array of functions.
In addition to their broad expression in the periphery, which is beyond the scope of this dissertation, chemokines and CKRs are also expressed by healthy neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells (for a comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)</span>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.2</span> CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair structure, expression, and signaling</h4>
<p>CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine δ family <span class="citation">(Pan <em>et al.</em>, 1997)</span>.
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids <span class="citation">(Bazan <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Pan <em>et al.</em>, 1997)</span>.
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids <span class="citation">(Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie, 2012)</span>.
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) <em>via</em> the action of several proteases (<span class="citation">Bajetto <em>et al.</em> (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Schulte <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span>, see Section <a href="intro.html#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>).
These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS), acting both in the periphery and the CNS <span class="citation">(Garton <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Hundhausen <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Clark <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Cook <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Jones <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration <span class="citation">(Ransohoff, 2009)</span>.
Some important molecular pathways implicated in CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are summarized in Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:cx3cr1signal">1.3</a>.</p>
<p>Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a G<sub>i</sub>-protein-coupled receptor <span class="citation">(Imai <em>et al.</em>, 1997)</span>.
The subunit G<sub>i</sub> inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a variety of intracellular second messengers, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NFκB) <span class="citation">(Al-Aoukaty <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Chandrasekar <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.

<p>In the brain, CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, are widely distributed in the CNS, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus <span class="citation">(Harrison <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Besides the well-documented neuronal expression of CX3CL1, a handful of studies also revealed its presence in astrocytes, albeit at lower levels (for instance: <span class="citation">Sunnemark <em>et al.</em> (2005)</span>).
However, the expression pattern of CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, in the CNS, remains controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia <span class="citation">(Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Cardona <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>, whereas several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 1998, 2000; Maciejewski-Lenoir <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Hatori <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Hughes <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Verge <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Zhuang <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya <em>et al.</em>, 2012, 2014)</span>.
Thus, although predominantly expressed by microglia, CX3CR1 is also documented to be present on neuronal membranes, at least in pathological conditions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1α, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily.
In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (α, β, γ, δ, ε, φ), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa <span class="citation">(Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
The α product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one <span class="citation">(Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
Hence, as used here, the term “CXCL12” refers to the α isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation.
It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein.
However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological processes (for a review: <span class="citation">Britton <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span>).
CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded β-sheet held in close apposition to an α-helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation <span class="citation">(Murphy <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7.
All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species <span class="citation">(Nomiyama <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Nomiyama &amp; Yoshie, 2015)</span>.
Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Balabanian <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>CXCL12, along with their receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, is constitutively expressed and widely distributed in the CNS, both during neurodevelopment and adulthood <span class="citation">(Banisadr <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Stumm <em>et al.</em>, 2002, 2003; Schönemeier <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Moreover, these molecules are present in nearly all CNS cell types, including endothelial, glial, and notably neuronal cells.
Specifically, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-localized with many neuropeptides, for example, in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA)<span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
Furthermore, ACKR3 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in the same neuronal <span class="citation">(Shimizu <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span> and astrocytic populations <span class="citation">(Odemis <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
In neurons, prominent cytoplasmic expression of ACKR3 was demonstrated, whereas CXCR4 was found on the cell membrane <span class="citation">(Shimizu <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, suggesting that ACKR3 may affect CXCR4 trafficking and/or coupling to other proteins <span class="citation">(Shimizu <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Consistently, ACKR3 up-regulation was shown to enhance heterodimer formation with CXCR4, which further resulted in its internalization and degeneration <span class="citation">(Uto-Konomi <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Moreover, as described in detail in Section Biased signaling (see Section: <a href="intro.html#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>), there is a possibility that CXCL12 might trigger different ACKR3- or CXCR4- signaling in certain cellular contexts, which could lead to either G protein-dependent or -independent biased response.</p>
<p>Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, in addition to the enhancement of receptor-ligand binding, there is a subsequent GDP exchange for GTP, and the trimeric G<sub>i</sub>-protein dissociates into its constituent parts, G<sub>αi</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> (<span class="citation">Ganju <em>et al.</em> (1998)</span>; see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:cxcl12sig">1.4</a>).
These molecules activate several intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review: <span class="citation">Britton <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span>, <span class="citation">Ward (2006)</span>).
PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).
IP3 production leads to increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC).
Both intracellular free calcium and PKC promote the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and proliferation.
In parallel, the α<sub>i</sub> subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase and a consequent cAMP production and activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in cell cycle entry and proliferation <span class="citation">(Cheng <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
In addition to the well-characterized coupling to G<sub>αi</sub>, convincing evidence illustrates that CXCR4 can also bind to other G<sub>α</sub> proteins such as G<sub>αq</sub>, G<sub>αo</sub>, and G<sub>αs</sub> (for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Pozzobon <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:cxcl12sig">1.4</a>).
For example, by binding to G<sub>α12/13</sub>, CXCR4 leads to Rho activation, whereas G<sub>αq</sub> signal through Rac activation.
Moreover, it is well documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal pathway.
Following CXCR4 activation, G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are also activated, inducing the intracellular C-terminal domain phosphorylation, which, in turn, results in β-arrestins recruitment.
These molecules lead to the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and subsequent receptor internalization.
Moreover, β-arrestins were reported to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CXCR4, leading to receptor downregulation and trafficking to endosomal compartments <span class="citation">(DeNies <em>et al.</em>, 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>CXCL12 second receptor, ACKR3, like other ACKR receptors, contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs <span class="citation">(Thelen &amp; Thelen, 2008)</span>.
The modification of this motif is believed to disable the activation of G proteins and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced chemotaxis <span class="citation">(Burns <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Levoye <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Rajagopal <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Thus, for a long time, as a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 was thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration <span class="citation">(Naumann <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 could also signal <em>via</em> the β-arrestin pathway <span class="citation">(Rajagopal <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Moreover, although the same ligand activates CXCR4 and ACKR3, they signal through different pathways (β-arrestin vs. G-coupled).
Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a β-arrestin biased receptor (see Section <a href="intro.html#chemokinessignal">1.1.2.1</a>).
Nonetheless, more recently, it was shown that ACKR3 has functionality independent of the β-arrestins.
Specifically, <span class="citation">Montpas <em>et al.</em> (2018)</span> demonstrated that both small interfering RNA knockdown of β-arrestin1 and or β-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells do not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of ACKR3’s ligands (i.e., CXCL11 and CXCL12).
In addition, the following studies further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels following the activation of Pertussis Toxin-sensitive G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins, leading to proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes <span class="citation">(Odemis <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: <span class="citation">Bajetto <em>et al.</em> (2001)</span>), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor <span class="citation">(Odemis <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>.
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells.
Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist <span class="citation">(Burns <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>, resulted in activation of β-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting <span class="citation">(Odemis <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>.
Therefore, it is speculated that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Connexin-43 (Cx43) internalization in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner <span class="citation">(Fumagalli <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
In contrast, CXCR4 leads to NF-κβ activation with consequent Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) and glutamate release from these cells <span class="citation">(Bezzi <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Calì <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Calì &amp; Bezzi, 2010)</span>.
Therefore, these data suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions <em>via</em> different signaling pathways in astrocytes, indicating that, in particular cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling <span class="citation">(Heuninck <em>et al.</em>, 2019)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Chemokines actions in the CNS</h3>
<p>Over the past two decades, mounting evidence has illustrated that chemokines are also essential players in the CNS during neurodevelopment and in the adult brain beyond their well-known immunological role.
Accordingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors, including the described above CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes, overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS, suggesting their involvement in local communication, especially crosstalk between neurons and glia.</p>
<p>Recently, in the light of the “glial revolution,” our long-held views of the functions of these cells have been completely challenged.
Astrocytes, previously considered supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, network oscillations, and behavior <span class="citation">(Perea <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Mederos &amp; Perea, 2019)</span>.
Being organized into microdomains and coupled into multicellular astrocytic networks <em>via</em> gap junctions, they are highly specialized cells (for a review: <span class="citation">Khakh &amp; Sofroniew (2015)</span>).
Furthermore, astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites, and synapses.
For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte makes contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans <span class="citation">(Oberheim <em>et al.</em>, 2009)</span>, suggesting bidirectional communication.
Indeed, they are endowed with a great variety of ion channels and receptors <span class="citation">(Olsen <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Seifert <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Kofuji &amp; Araque, 2021)</span> to react to a changing microenvironment, while they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters <span class="citation">(Araque <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Covelo &amp; Araque, 2018; Savtchouk &amp; Volterra, 2018)</span>.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission.
Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews <span class="citation">(Araque <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Bazargani &amp; Attwell, 2016; Guerra-Gomes <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about 5–12% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord <span class="citation">(Szepesi <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
They are derived from the myeloid precursor cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development (for a review, see: <span class="citation">Prinz &amp; Mildner (2011)</span>).
These glial cells are also broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a review, see: <span class="citation">Szepesi <em>et al.</em> (2018)</span>).
Although microglia have long been recognized as “guardians of the brain,” regulating inflammatory responses in the CNS, it is becoming increasingly evident that their functions are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain during both development and adulthood.
Being equipped by highly motile processes, microglia are dynamic and plastic cells that constantly monitor the microenvironment to sense local perturbation.
Moreover, similar to astrocytes, microglia also express numerous cell surface ion channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, as well as signaling molecules.</p>
<p>Hence, both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamic and heterogeneous cells.
Notably, those rich repertoires of expressed surface and signaling molecules include a set of chemokines and their receptors.
Thus, glial cells can both react to and release chemokines (for example: <span class="citation">Dorf <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, <span class="citation">McKimmie &amp; Graham (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Sowa <em>et al.</em> (2017)</span>).
Given constant glial monitoring of brain parenchyma, these immune molecules might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the influence of the environment to brain function, from cellular to synaptic, network, and finally behavioral levels.</p>
<p>The first discoveries regarding CX3CL1 and CXCL12 non-inflammatory roles were studies showing their influence on the reduction of neurotoxicity, mainly by activating neuroprotective pathways, such as Akt phosphorylation or activation of MAP kinases (p-38, ERK½) <span class="citation">(Maciejewski-Lenoir <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 2000)</span>.
Specifically, CXCL12 <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 1998)</span> and then CX3CL1 <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 2000)</span> were reported to reduce the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons induced by gp120 or glia deprivation.
Later, more studies further documented that both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced and N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cultures from either rodents or humans <span class="citation">(Deiva <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Nicolai <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the binding of CX3CL1 to microglial CX3CR1 was shown to restrain LPS-induced microglia activation (<span class="citation">Mizuno <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>; <span class="citation">Zujovic <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, for a review: <span class="citation">Biber <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span>), leading to the initial presumption that CX3CL1 maintains microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state.
However, further studies illustrated that microglia activation is not an all or none event, but rather a continuum of progressive stages depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cues in the local environment, which, in turn, change their phenotype and functional activity (<span class="citation">Crain <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>; <span class="citation">Lively &amp; Schlichter (2013)</span>; for a review: <span class="citation">Masuda <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span> and <span class="citation">Tan <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, following the CX3CL1 application, microglia was reported to release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection, including adenosine <span class="citation">(Lauro <em>et al.</em>, 2008, 2010)</span>.
It is an endogenous modulator of brain functions, binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes (adenosine A1 receptor, adenosine A2A receptor, adenosine A<sub>2C</sub> receptor, and adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor - A<sub>1</sub>R, A<sub>2A</sub>R, A<sub>2C</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub>R, respectively).
It was shown that adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection <em>via</em> A<sub>1</sub>R <span class="citation">(Lauro <em>et al.</em>, 2008, 2010)</span>.
This receptor, expressed on microglia, was also reported to be required for CX3CL1 increase in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) activity in astrocytes, resulting in higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and thereby neuroprotective action <span class="citation">(Catalano <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Thus, these data nicely illustrate the CX3CL1-regulated local communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to neuroprotection.</p>
<p>The next milestone in neuroimmunology was observations that CX3CL1 and CXCL12 with their corresponding receptors exhibit the highest expression during neurodevelopment, indicating their crucial functions during this period.
Indeed, it has become increasingly evident that both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes are crucial players in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival in this period.
For instance, during hippocampal development, CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> deficient microglia showed impaired migration <span class="citation">(Paolicelli <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Pagani <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
This observation was associated with their delayed synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient reduction of synaptic density and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties <span class="citation">(Paolicelli <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Precisely, these changes were observed during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline.
Importantly, these mice were also tested in similar experimental settings in their adulthood (P40) <span class="citation">(Zhan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Although dendritic spine density remained unchanged, neurons from CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> mice still displayed a lower frequency of miniature and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and sEPSCs, respectively) than their wild-type littermates, illustrating that a transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic transmission despite unchanged the number of excitatory synapses <span class="citation">(Zhan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those neurodevelopmental processes regulated by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 (i.e., proliferation, migration, and survival) are also present in the adult brain.
Accordingly, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are associated not only with developmental neurogenesis <span class="citation">(Tran <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Pujol <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Lysko <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>, but also adult neurogenesis, which is restricted to two neurogenic regions, i.e., the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) near the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus.
For example, both CXCR4 and CX3CR1 receptors are expressed on neural stem cells <span class="citation">(Ji <em>et al.</em>, 2004)</span>.
In addition, it is well established that CXCL12 is responsible for the generation and positioning of new neurons within these niches, as well as their axonal and dendritic outgrowth and branching <span class="citation">(Abe <em>et al.</em>, 2015, 2018; Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.
Moreover, similar to what was observed during the neurodevelopment, in CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice, adult-born granule neurons in the DG also displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with additionally observed morphological changes, such as enlargement and shortening <span class="citation">(Bolós <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
Besides being ultrastructurally enlarged, synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality.</p>
<p>Given their previously mentioned inhibition of both glutamate and NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity, together with their influence on neuronal processes outgrowth, branching, and synaptic pruning, one could speculate that CXCL12 and CX3CL1 could modulate electrophysiological properties in the CNS.
Indeed, accumulating data reveals that these chemokines modulate neuronal electrical activity through both postsynaptic (e.g., changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients or intrinsic membrane properties by activation/inactivation of particular channels/receptors following CKRs activation) and presynaptic (i.e., including presence in synaptic vesicle and (co-)release of neuropeptides/neurotransmitters/gliotransmitters) mechanisms (for a review: <span class="citation">Rostène <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span> and <span class="citation">Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)</span>).
For example, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents <span class="citation">(Meucci <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Limatola <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Lauro <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Importantly, further investigations revealed that CX3CL1 might not exclusively act on postsynaptic neurons but also activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine <span class="citation">(Piccinin <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Similarly, one of the adenosinergic receptors, the A<sub>2A</sub>R, together with D-serine release from glial cells, is also required for CX3CL1 regulation of NMDA receptor function <span class="citation">(Scianni <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 influence adult neurogenesis along with synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, which are believed to affect synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning.
Accordingly, both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 axes were reported to be upregulated following learning <span class="citation">(Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Su <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>.
In addition, several lines of evidence illustrated that CX3CL1 modulates synaptic plasticity in this region <span class="citation">(Bertollini <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Maggi <em>et al.</em>, 2009, 2011; Paolicelli <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span> and regulates learning and memory <span class="citation">(Maggi <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Serchov <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Reshef <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Chemokines’ regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus.
Briefly, both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 molecules were shown to affect synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum <span class="citation">(Giovannelli <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>, and mice with CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> receptor deletion were characterized by the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the spinal cord <span class="citation">(Bian <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
These findings may be associated with CX3CL1-mediated behavioral consequences regarding motor coordination and pain <span class="citation">(Verge <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
It also should be noted that another form of synaptic plasticity, i.e., synaptic scaling, is widely accepted to be mediated by TNFα <span class="citation">(Bezzi <em>et al.</em>, 2001)</span>, which is mainly expressed by astrocytes, for example, <em>via</em> CXCR4 activation <span class="citation">(Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006)</span>.
Therefore, by modulating TNFα levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity <span class="citation">(Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, mounting evidence shows interactions between the chemokine system and “classical” neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.
For instance, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the SN, the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN <span class="citation">(Ragozzino <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010)</span>.
By acting on the presynaptic site, CXCL12 affects the activity of serotoninergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA), and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons, thereby modulating the release of neuroactive molecules <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, CXCL12 is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: <span class="citation">Bhattacharyya <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span>).
However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin, MCH, and DA), postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved in this phenomenon.
For example, in MCH neurons, CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels of the action potential <span class="citation">(Guyon, Banisadr, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>, or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents <span class="citation">(Guyon, Rovère, <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.
These results suggest that CXCL12 signaling may be involved in neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and stress.
In line with this notion, CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia.
Not only a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH), but also an intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus <span class="citation">(Poon <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior.</p>
<p>Similarly, the dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of both pre- and postsynaptic actions of CXCL12.
CXCL12 was reported to enhance the frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) in this region, indicating presynaptic mechanisms, which is in line with the documented presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
In addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 could act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of high voltage-activated calcium currents <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Consistent with this data, by using unilateral intranigral or intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12, a further study has illustrated that this chemokine triggered contralateral turns in circling behavior <span class="citation">(Skrzydelski <em>et al.</em>, 2007)</span>.
Of note, considering that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in dopamine neurons, this chemokine is speculated to act in an autocrine manner <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span>.
Importantly, some CXCL12-induced increase in an inward current is suggested to be induced from glutamate release from astrocytes <span class="citation">(Guyon <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, over the last decade, the notion that dysfunctions in the chemokine system lead to neuropsychiatric diseases has attracted much attention (for a review <span class="citation">Stuart <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>).
Broadly, dysfunctions in the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pairs are similar to “sickness behavior.”
It is a physiological and psychological state characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines <span class="citation">(Dantzer, 2001; Dantzer &amp; Kelley, 2007)</span>.
Given the described above, modulation of the release of serotonin in the DRN as well as involvement in feeding behavior and learning by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 may affect mood and lead to depression <span class="citation">(Maes <em>et al.</em>, 1998)</span>.
Accordingly, the link between those chemokines and chronic stress is well-documented <span class="citation">(Zhan <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Sowa <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Piirainen <em>et al.</em>, 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, initial behavioral evidence is starting to elucidate the possible mediation of those chemokines in anxiety-related behavior <span class="citation">(Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Bolós <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Schubert <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
Those types of behavior are widely accepted to be due to dysfunctions in the functioning of the amygdala.
Consistently, this region was reported to display relatively high expression of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Nishiyori <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Tarozzo <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala.</p>
<p>Moreover, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages the amygdala <span class="citation">(Frenois <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Harrison <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Engler <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
In addition, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).
Mounting evidence also illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part.
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders <span class="citation">(Tovote <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Girgenti <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>, epilepsy <span class="citation">(Fabene <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Roseti <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Tian <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Suleymanova, 2021)</span>, obesity <span class="citation">(Guillemot-Legris &amp; Muccioli, 2017; Kawamura <em>et al.</em>, 2021)</span>, pain <span class="citation">(Old &amp; Malcangio, 2012; Mélik Parsadaniantz <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019; Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>, drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; <span class="citation">Coller &amp; Hutchinson (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Freeman <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Jacobsen <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Wang <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.</p>
<p>Finally, recent studies demonstrated glial mediation in behavior, including in the amygdala <span class="citation">(Martin-Fernandez <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Althammer <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors.</p>
<p>Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit.</p>

<!-- ####  CXCL12- and CX3CL1-induced regulation of neuron-astrocyte-microglia communication {#example}

Here, I will introduce a simplified model of coordinated actions of neuron-glia interactions fine-tuned by chosen chemokines and gliotransmitters. 

As mentioned above, CX3CL1 is the most widely studied chemokines in relation to neuron–microglia crosstalk and regulation of microglial activity. 
Accumulating evidence illustrates that many environmental triggers can up-regulate CX3CL1 expression, including an insult [@hughes_2002], learning [@sheridan_2014], or the presence of another chemokine, CXCL12, *via* its action on neuronal ADAM17 [@cook_2010] (Fig....).

CX3CL1 was shown to exert neuroprotective actions against  Glu-induced  excitotoxicity, with  mechanisms  fully  dependent  on  A~1~R  [@lauro_2008; @lauro_2010] and at least partially dependent on  A~3~R  [@rosito_2012; @rosito_2014].
In contrast, NMDA-induced toxicity, mainly mediated by NR2B-containing extrasynaptic  NMDARs, was reported to require A~2A~R and the presence  of D-serine [@scianni_2013; @lauro_2014].
These results highlight that modulation of glial function by adenosine is essential in the context of neuroprotection, as both microglia and astrocytes release it as a gliotransmitter.

Additionally, it is well-established that astrocytes might also exert a neuroprotective role upon brain insult by buffering extracellular Glu [@blanger_2009]. 
Evidence illustrated that CX3CL1, acting on microglia, induced the production and release of adenosine that exerted their effects on astrocytes by binding to A~1~R (Fig. 3D), and consequently inducing the up-regulation of the astrocytic GLT-1 transporter (Fig. 3E, @catalano_2013).
Microglia can also release CXCL12, which then acts, for example, *via* astrocytic CXCR4 and, in turn, produces TNFα, leading to remyelination (see Fig...; @bezzi_2001, @cunha_2020).

To sum up, the  mentioned above findings strongly support the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines are key communicating molecules between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserving brain functions.
Please note that this is a simplification of neuron-microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in the context of neuroprotection, and many other factors and connections are omitted for the sake of clarity. -->
<!--### Chemokines modulates behavior {#behavior}

Since mounting evidence supports the notion that chemokines coordinate several brain circuits of behavioral relevance, including hippocampus, DRN, SN, hypothalamus, it may indicate their contribution to these behaviors.
Consistent with this idea, disturbances of several chemokines/chemokine receptor axes were implicated in the pathophysiology of neurobiological disorders [@paolicelli_2014; @poon_2016; @stuart_2015].
Moreover, despite increasing evidence about the chemokine system's role in mediating homeostatic brain functions, the mechanisms underlying chemokines regulation of behavior under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. 
Hence, here I discuss a handful of studies on the regulation of chemokines on various types of behavior, such as learning and memory, social interactions, locomotor activity, anxiety. 
Results from those studies are summarized in Table 3. 

To sum up, these findings reinforce the idea that chemokines and their receptors are involved in higher brain functions regulating many types of behavior, including cognitive, motor, and emotional behavioral effects.
However, to date, very little is known about their cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological profile with regard to potential interaction with glia to put these results in a broader context. // and glial-mediated mechanisms to put these results in a broader context.///

// dobre połączenie z AMYGDALA///
Although many brain regions have been found to participate in anxiety regulation it is commonly accepted that among them the amygdala plays a prominent role (Canteras et al., 2010; Davis and Whalen, 2001; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Engin and Treit, 2008; Everitt et al., 2003; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000, 2007; McNally et al., 2011; Pape and Paré, 2010; Paré et al., 2004; Pérez de la Mora et al., 2008, 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2009).

Several behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, commonly occur in mice with CX3CR1 deletion. -->
<!-- 
All neuronal circuits of higher animals comprise excitatory and inhibitory neurons forming intense feed-forward and feedback connections [@mohler_1990, @ferrante_2009, @roth_2012].
However, the precise control of network operations would not be possible without interneurons.
Although they constitute only 20-30% of all cells in cortical circuits, this small, diverse group of inhibitory neurons enables higher brain functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, or social interaction (for a review: @mederos_2019). 
Through inhibition, GABAergic interneurons can shape the circuit activity controlling (1) frequency of surrounding pyramidal neurons, (2) network excitation level by feed-forward mechanism, and (3) synchronized oscillation events [@mederos_2019]. 
The importance of interneurons in relation to network functioning illustrates the highly controlled manner by which interneurons connect with other neurons [@tremblay_2016]. 

##### Synaptic scaling {#scal}

In order to prevent the destabilizing component of Hebbian plasticity in network function, neurons are able to sense their excitability and trigger negative-feedback homeostatic mechanisms to counteract perturbations in synaptic activity and restrain it within a dynamical but physiological range [@field_2020]. 
Recent accumulating data also highlight the essential role of glial cells, as they are equipped with, for instance, glutamate transporters to control the concentration of glutamate and other neurotransmitters in the microenvironment. 
Importantly, stable but flexible neural activity is fundamental for proper brain function and support of animal behavior, depending on a dynamic interface between homeostatic synaptic  plasticity  mechanisms  and  Hebbian  forms  of plasticity [@field_2020; @tremblay_2016].-->

<div id="amygdala" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Amygdala</h2>
<p>The amygdala is a brain structure located in the medial temporal lobe associated with a broad array of behaviors, such as learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction <span class="citation">(LeDoux, 2000; Ehrlich <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Roozendaal <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Herry <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Surprisingly, despite this variety of functions, the amygdala is well-conserved throughout evolution.
Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and fishes have counterparts with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals (for a review: <span class="citation">Janak &amp; Tye (2015)</span>).
It is speculated that this may be due to the adaptive context of those phenomena.
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can mobilize adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future.
For example, during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, for example, a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, including freezing behavior <span class="citation">(LeDoux, 2000; Janak &amp; Tye, 2015)</span>.
Analogously, reward-induced conditioning responses lead to a cue-triggered behavior <span class="citation">(Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Thus, both learning about danger and potential rewards are adaptive and engage the amygdala <span class="citation">(Janak &amp; Tye, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>These distinct behaviors are believed to be reflected by widespread amygdala connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape &amp; Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>) as well as is complex inner structure.
This limbic region is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of nuclei, which can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>).
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) <span class="citation">(McDonald, 1998; Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Here, the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA), and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers (<span class="citation">Bocchio <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Ehrlich <em>et al.</em> (2009)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape &amp; Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Spampanato <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere <span class="citation">(Pitkänen <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.</p>

<p>Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, have been dissecting how genetically targeted cellular activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for example, <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>).
Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the amygdala’s role, anatomy, and physiology.
The physiological and morphological properties of neurons in relation to specific nuclei are shown in Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>, whereas simplified illustrations of their main inputs, outputs, and intra-connectivity are depicted in Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>.</p>
<div id="BLA" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA)</h3>
<p>The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
All these nuclei are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter this term will be used.
The BLA is considered the main input nuclei of the amygdala (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah &amp; Lopez De Armentia (2003)</span>).
Briefly, multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA.
It is carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory, associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala <em>via</em> the external or internal capsules (for reviews: <span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>).
A large body of evidence highlights the role of these terminals in the acquisition of fear and appetitive conditioning, which is associated with synaptic potentiation in the BLA <span class="citation">(Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
In addition, this nucleus is strongly innervated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a).
Specifically, this region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2) serotonergic projections originating from the DRN, (3) dense dopaminergic innervation from the VTA and the SN, and (4) projections from the basal forebrain (<span class="citation">Prager <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> and references therein).</p>
<p>This complex of the amygdala displays cortical-like characteristics based on its developmental origin and structural organization <span class="citation">(Waclaw <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>, although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization <span class="citation">(Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014)</span>.
Accordingly, both principal cells (PCs) and interneurons show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal counterparts.</p>
<p>Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections (<span class="citation">Faber <em>et al.</em> (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Paré <em>et al.</em> (1995)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
The degree of this adaptation forms a continuum: at one end, cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation <span class="citation">(Funahashi <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Faber <em>et al.</em>, 2001)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of parameters, which is a subject of many excellent reviews <span class="citation">(Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Prager <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Hájos, 2021)</span>.
Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population, and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons <span class="citation">(Kemppainen &amp; Pitkänen, 2000; McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously <em>in vivo</em> at high frequencies (10-15 Hz) <span class="citation">(Paré <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons <span class="citation">(Group <em>et al.</em>, 2008)</span> but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004)</span>.
Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns <span class="citation">(Spampanato <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.
Some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells (<span class="citation">Rainnie <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>), whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation <span class="citation">(Jasnow <em>et al.</em>, 2009)</span>.
However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear.
Nevertheless, it is speculated that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: <span class="citation">Spampanato <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>, <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Also, contrary to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004)</span>.
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and chandelier cells (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology <span class="citation">(Klenowski <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons.</p>

</div>
<p>Principal cells are densely interconnected between subdivisions of the BLA complex by sending long-distance collaterals (<span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>; <span class="citation">Smith <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
PCs from the lateral part send many projections onto their counterparts in the basal nuclei (B) <span class="citation">(Krettek &amp; Price, 1978; Pitkänen <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014)</span>, displaying preferential lateromedial directionality of those connections.
In addition, principal cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons (<span class="citation">Szinyei <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).</p>
<p>BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their primary source of GABAergic inputs (<span class="citation">Bienvenu <em>et al.</em> (2012)</span>; <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Rainnie <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).</p>
<p>Principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA <span class="citation">(Brinley-Reed <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Farb &amp; LeDoux, 1997; Farb &amp; Ledoux, 1999)</span> and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses <span class="citation">(Klenowski <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
However, further ultrastructural analyses revealed that distinct subtypes of interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target of PCs.
Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; <span class="citation">McDonald &amp; Betette (2001)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2005)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2006)</span>).
Given that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs’ spiking output and timing <span class="citation">(Woodruff <em>et al.</em>, 2006)</span>.
In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons (<span class="citation">Muller <em>et al.</em> (2007)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Like excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines.
Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA.
The regulation of the BLA network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by <span class="citation">Prager <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>, as it is beyond the topic of this dissertation.</p>
<p>In addition to their strong regulation of PCs’ activity, BLA interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron contacts.
Electron microscopy analyses revealed that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being mediated by gap junctions <span class="citation">(Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.
While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among BLA interneurons remains high, but mainly within the same subtype <span class="citation">(Muller <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Woodruff &amp; Sah, 2007b)</span>.
This notion was further supported by a study using a conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical synapses (<span class="citation">Andrási <em>et al.</em> (2017)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).</p>
<p>Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors.
In general, activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-dependent, and slow, GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor-dependent components <span class="citation">(Washburn &amp; Moises, 1992a)</span>.
Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory components originate from distinct subpopulations of interneurons <span class="citation">(Sugita <em>et al.</em>, 1992)</span>.</p>
<p>The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations and flow of information.
These are often thought to be comprised of feedback inhibition <span class="citation">(Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Unal <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>, feedforward inhibition <span class="citation">(Lang &amp; Paré, 1997; Popescu &amp; Paré, 2011; Bazelot <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, and disinhibition <span class="citation">(Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span> (for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Tremblay <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a)</span>).
Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA.
Indeed, accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of emotional learning in the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004; Pelletier &amp; Paré, 2004; Bauer <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Klenowski <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections, thereby modulating several behavioral responses <span class="citation">(Bauer <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Courtin <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Davis <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Zheng <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that despite being the main input of the amygdaloid complex, the BLA sends a few projections.
Despite its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NA), indicated as crucial in reward-seeking behavior <span class="citation">(Stuber <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Namburi <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Beyeler <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Nevertheless, the BLA predominantly projects to the extended amygdala (see Section <a href="intro.html#CeA">1.2.3</a>), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the CeA (see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, parts b and c).
Those connections are associated with anxiety and social interactions <span class="citation">(Tye <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Felix-Ortiz <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Felix-Ortiz &amp; Tye, 2014; Felix-Ortiz <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Notably, the CeA can be innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto CeA neurons (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span>, <span class="citation">Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah (2004)</span> or indirectly <em>via</em> GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward inhibition (<span class="citation">Jüngling <em>et al.</em> (2008)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer <em>et al.</em> (1999)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).</p>
</div>
<div id="ITCs" class="section level3" number="1.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Intercalated cell masses</h3>
<p>Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the BLA.
Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into (1) lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITC<sub>L</sub>), bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITC<sub>MP</sub>, localized within the intermediate capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA, and (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITC<sub>VM</sub>) (<span class="citation">Mańko <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Millhouse (1986)</span>, <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).</p>
<p>Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (10–15 µm) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle <span class="citation">(Nitecka &amp; Ben-Ari, 1987; McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993)</span>, and larger (&gt;50 µm) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices (<span class="citation">Bienvenu <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>,<a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Moreover, ITCs express the highest density of µ-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala <span class="citation">(Marowsky <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Jacobsen <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Pape &amp; Pare, 2010; Palomares-Castillo <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span>, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.
Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1α (mGluR1α), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors α1 subunit, and PV <span class="citation">(Bienvenu <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.
Electrophysiologically, both types of cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance, higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA interneurons <span class="citation">(Royer <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Geracitano <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Busti <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Mańko <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each cluster but also between clusters.
For example, ITC<sub>L</sub> interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs <span class="citation">(Strobel <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, thereby providing feedforward inhibition to BLA principal neurons <span class="citation">(Marowsky <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>.
On the other hand, the BLA mainly targets more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an inhibitory interface between the BLA and CeA (<span class="citation">Busti <em>et al.</em> (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Marowsky <em>et al.</em> (2005)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer <em>et al.</em> (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
Hence, intercalated cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially by gating CeA output.</p>
</div>
<div id="CeA" class="section level3" number="1.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> The central amygdala</h3>
<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions <span class="citation">(McDonald, 1982b; Jolkkonen &amp; Pitkänen, 1998; Sah <em>et al.</em>, 2003)</span>.
Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL <span class="citation">(Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014)</span>.
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the BNST and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense intra-connectivity (<span class="citation">Krettek &amp; Price (1978)</span> and for a review: <span class="citation">Fox <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Gilpin <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Sah <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>).
However, here we focus mainly on the CeA.</p>
<p>Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
However, similar to the BLA, there are also exceptions from this oversimplified model, and both CeM and CeL receive direct projections outside the amygdala (see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a)).
Among others, neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT, <span class="citation">Do-Monte <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Penzo <em>et al.</em> (2015)</span>), the BNST <span class="citation">(Gungor <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>, parabrachial nucleus (PBN; <span class="citation">Carter <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>) or oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus <span class="citation">(Knobloch <em>et al.</em>, 2012)</span> sends projections to this region, influencing a diverse set of behaviors.</p>
<p>Neurons within this nucleus are a diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and <em>in vivo</em> patterns of activity.
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons <span class="citation">(McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Sun &amp; Cassell, 1993)</span>, further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA <span class="citation">(Medina <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Waclaw <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (i.e., a small soma and numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low density of dendritic spines (<span class="citation">Cassell &amp; Gray (1989)</span>; <span class="citation">McDonald (1982b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections <span class="citation">(Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive firing spikes <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004)</span>.
Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells <span class="citation">(Martina <em>et al.</em>, 1999)</span>.
The latter is characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency (&gt;40 Hz) with no accommodation <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>, as their counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA.
Moreover, their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with &gt; 1 ms in other cell types in CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>.
The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed with T-type calcium channels, which are thought to contribute to characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to depolarizing current pulses as well as rebound spikes when hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied <span class="citation">(Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including SOM, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin (ENK), and others <span class="citation">(Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Generally, the CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features <span class="citation">(Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Martina <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004; Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
PKCδ-expressing neurons form a relatively homogeneous group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (∼85%; <span class="citation">Haubensak <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>).
The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons <span class="citation">(Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Functionally, following fear-conditioning, these neurons display a reduced firing and thus are often referred to as CeL<sub>OFF</sub> cells <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, almost half of the PKCδ neurons co-express ENK or OR, which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM <span class="citation">(Huber <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Viviani <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKCδ marker express SOM <span class="citation">(Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Those cells display heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining 40% are classified as LF <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Moreover, during fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear memory <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Haubensak <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Importantly, sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
Therefore, they have often been termed CeL<sub>ON</sub> neurons.
Many findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF <span class="citation">(Pomrenze <em>et al.</em>, 2015; McCullough <em>et al.</em>, 2018)</span>.
Accordingly, as PKCδ and CRF- or SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional roles.</p>
<p>CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes (Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
For example, synapses formed between LF→RS and RS→LF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class <span class="citation">(Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal activity of the CeL is required for the fear acquisition, whereas activity in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Moreover, CeM activation alone is well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing <span class="citation">(LeDoux <em>et al.</em>, 1988)</span>, whereas CeL neurons were revealed to tonically inhibit CeM output <span class="citation">(Ciocchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Gozzi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>.
Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PKCδ-expressing cells than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable projections to the CeM <span class="citation">(Li <em>et al.</em>, 2013)</span>.
In contrast, the PKCδ-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons (<span class="citation">Haubensak <em>et al.</em> (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Li <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>, Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
Hence, during the presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically inhibited by CeL<sub>ON</sub>, SOM-immunopositive neurons <span class="citation">(Gozzi <em>et al.</em>, 2010)</span>, leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction of freezing.
However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced, PKCδ-expressing CeL<sub>OFF</sub> projection neurons become active, inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output.
Therefore, the balance between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly impacts the behavioral output of this region.</p>
<p>CeA projections are illustrated in Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b.
Broadly, both CeM and CeL neurons send substantial projections, especially to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), but also the BNST and LC, affecting fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing <span class="citation">(Asok <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2018)</span>.
Moreover, in addition to its well-known role in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the pain pathway <span class="citation">(Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019)</span>.
Reward-related behaviors are modulated not only by CeA projections to the SN, the VTA, and the LH <span class="citation">(Tsumori <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Reyes <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Pomrenze <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span> but also CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC <span class="citation">(Seo <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, which stimulation was shown to mediate brain reward function.
CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) are also implicated in autonomic regulation <span class="citation">(Viviani <em>et al.</em>, 2011)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Summary</h3>
<p>Taken together, each nucleus receives a unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
These combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enable increasing or decreasing the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence.
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and origin.
All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and homeostatic control.
Considering this diversity, it is not surprising that the disruption of the amygdala functioning is associated with many disorders, including alcoholism and other reward-related disorders, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and stress-related disorders, autism, obesity, epilepsy, pain, just to list a few.
Thus, the amygdala functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant sensory information about the external and internal environment into behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in homeostasis.
Finally, as amygdala circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution <span class="citation">(Jarvis <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</span>, better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.</p>
