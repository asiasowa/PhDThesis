<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.1</span> History of chemokines</h4>
<p>Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of small (7-11 kDa) secreted proteins with chemoattractant and regulatory activities. <!--( Baggiolini, 1998 )-->
They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 <span class="citation">(Yoshimura et al., 1987)</span>.
However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) <span class="citation">(Meucci et al., 1998)</span>.
Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS?
The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system <span class="citation">(Williams et al., 2014)</span>.
However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions.
It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation <em>via</em> their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions.
These results suggest their brain-specific functions. <!--involved in many physiological brain functions, both in development (cell migration and differentiation, neuronal circuits maturation etc.) and adulthood (regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions). // such as the modulation of synaptic transmission [@rostne_2007]. -->
Indeed, mounting evidence illustrates that chemokine can act on cellular (e.g., inducing neuroprotective signaling pathways), synaptic (e.g., modulating synaptic transmission), network (e.g., regulating synaptic potentiation), and behavioral levels (e.g., impairing memory; for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Sowa and Tokarski (2021)</span>).
Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications.
Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis <span class="citation">(Trettel et al., 2020)</span>.<!--Several chemokines are widely expressed throughout the CNS during development and throughout life where they have been shown to play diverse roles in cell migration and differentiation (Lu et al., 2002), regulation of cellular communication in the adult brain (Tran and Miller, 2003) and neuroprotection (Araujo and Cotman, 1993; Meucci et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 1998; Bruno et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2000; Hatori et al., 2002; Deiva et al., 2004; Krathwohl and Kaiser, 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Catalano et al., 2013; Shepherd et al., 2013). - Sheridan2014--><!-- In physiological conditions, CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling is involved in different neural functions both in development (participation in functional maturation of neuronal circuits driving cell positioning) and adulthood (regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions) [@lauro_2015][@adler_2005]. zmienić --></p>
<p>This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CL1 and CXCR4 or ACKR3, respectively, as they are expressed in the brain under non-inflammatory, basal conditions.</p>

<div id="classification" class="section level4" number="1.1.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.2</span> Classification and structure of chemokines and their receptors</h4>
<p>Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences.
Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa.
To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized <span class="citation">(Hughes and Nibbs, 2018)</span>.
All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet on which a C-terminal α-helix is folded (for review: <span class="citation">Miller and Mayo (2017)</span>).
Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard.
Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop<!--chemokine or chemokine receptor???-->, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: <span class="citation">Kleist et al. (2016)</span>).
Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. <!-- There are several regions of the chemokine that are critical for receptor binding and signal transduction --></p>
<p>Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them.
However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the N‐terminus.
It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter “L” (denoting “ligand”), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (<span class="citation">Zlotnik and Yoshie (2000)</span>, see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>).
Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as α, see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part a). <!-- (cysteine–X amino acid–cysteine, or CXC).// CXC chemokines have two cysteines separated by one amino acid, -->
Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as β, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part b). <!-- CC chemokines have two adjacent cysteines, -->
C chemokines (also known as γ, see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part c) are characterized by the presence of only two <!-- of the four-->cysteine residues.<br />
The CX3C (also known as δ) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine).
It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>, part d).</p>

<p>Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs).
Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains.
The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. <!-- zmienić bo całe zdanie zerżnięte z Paolicelli 2014 i MOŻE JESZCZE FIGURA, albo druga część figury 1?? -->
Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing “L” with “R,” which denotes “receptor” (see: Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:family">1.1</a>).
Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR <span class="citation">(Hughes and Nibbs, 2018)</span>.<!-- bardzo zerżnięte zdanie i może wyrzucić... --></p>
<p>Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to (1) the G<sub>αi</sub> subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cAMP levels or (2) G<sub>αq</sub> that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.
However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G<sub>11</sub> or G<sub>α12/13</sub>), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)½, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (for reviews: <span class="citation">Allen et al. (2007)</span>, <span class="citation">Rostène et al. (2011)</span>). <!-- The binding of the ligand on the appropriate chemokine receptor promotes structural changes on its cytoplasmic loops and tail, which catalyze the exchange of GDP with GTP on the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein   [10]  . The  and    betagamma subunits then dissociate and bind to cellular effector enzymes that generate second messengers as cAMP or IP3, which, in turn, activate distinct signaling pathways, leading to different cellular responses.  --></p>
<p>ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives <span class="citation">(Bachelerie et al., 2014; Salvi et al., 2017)</span>, structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)).
They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through β-arrestins <span class="citation">(Hughes and Nibbs, 2018)</span>.<br />
Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation <span class="citation">(Bachelerie et al., 2014; Bonecchi and Graham, 2016; Nibbs and Graham, 2013)</span>.
However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: <span class="citation">Salvi et al. (2017)</span>).
Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate.
Pioneer experiments demonstrated the expression of two ACKRs members, ACKR1 and ACKR3, in the CNS <!--citations-->(see Table <a href="#tab:chemoexpression"><strong>??</strong></a>), along with their behavioral relevance (see Chapter <a href="introduction.html#behavior">1.1.2.5.3</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, the classical, formulated in the mid-1900s classification, divided chemokines into inflammatory (or inducible) chemokines, whose expression is upregulated upon inflammation, and homeostatic chemokines, which display constitutive expression.
Several chemokines share both properties and have been called dual-function chemokines <span class="citation">(Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012)</span>.
On the other hand, considering that the same chemokine may exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on its concentration, cell type, tissue, and time, this view seems oversimplistic.
Nevertheless, given the advances in genomic methodology, chemokine receptors that bind homeostatic chemokines were shown to be located singly or in mini-clusters in different chromosomes and are well-conserved across species <span class="citation">(Nomiyama et al., 2013)</span>, highlighting their translational relevance in human diseases.</p>
<p>As chemokines constitute one of the most tightly regulated systems, their signaling is modulated <em>via</em> a broad array of factors, which are discussed below.
The figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a> illustrates most of these mechanisms, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes.</p>
</div>
<div id="chemosignal" class="section level4" number="1.1.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.3</span> Chemokine signaling</h4>
<p>After two decades of research on this topic, we are now beginning to appreciate the extent and complexity of the mechanisms responsible for chemokine signaling (see for reviews: <span class="citation">Eiger et al. (2021)</span>; <span class="citation">Hughes and Nibbs (2018)</span>; <span class="citation">Zweemer et al. (2014)</span>).
They enable tight and rapid control of chemokine signaling and quick response by the chemokine system to the dynamic microenvironment.
These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications, dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors, dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and biased-signaling (see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>). <!-- ominięte (4)  diversity in signaling pathways after chemokine activation, --></p>
<p>Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (<span class="citation">Hughes and Nibbs (2018)</span>, see: Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part a).
These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist <span class="citation">(Hughes and Nibbs, 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: <span class="citation">Zlotnik and Yoshie (2000)</span>, <span class="citation">Hughes and Nibbs (2018)</span>, Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:chemmechanisms">1.2</a>, part b).
It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands.
However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this section.
Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules <span class="citation">(Zweemer et al., 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding properties or activating different signaling pathways <span class="citation">(Salanga and Handel, 2011)</span>.
Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs <span class="citation">(Kleist et al., 2016)</span>.
Moreover, increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).</p>
<p>GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them.
It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors.
Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression <span class="citation">(Lortat-Jacob, 2009)</span>, along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication.</p>
<p>Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors (<span class="citation">Zweemer et al. (2014)</span>, <span class="citation">Kleist et al. (2016)</span>, see: Fig 2D).
Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished.<!-- based on??? --><br />
Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or β-arrestin, and their downstream elements, accordingly to cell-specific differences.
Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine.
Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokine–receptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts.
This type of bias is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and β-arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK½ or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages.</p>
<p>Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal context.</p>
<p>In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to list a few.
A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes.</p>

<p>Chemokines and CKRs are expressed by healthy neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells (for a comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Sowa and Tokarski (2021)</span>).</p>
<p>The neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS.
This suggests <!-- Constitutive brain expression of chemokines and their receptors on endothelial cells, neurons and glia, suggests a role for such molecules in mediating homeostatic cross-talk between cells of the brain parenchyma ( Williams et al., 2014 ). The cross-talk among neurons and glia is determinant to establish and maintain a normal brain function./// In addition, chemokines often co-localize with their corresponding receptors within the same cells, raising the possibility of autocrine signaling and complex cross-talks between different types of cells.-->
<!-- Interestingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of a chemokine and its receptor ///(see below and FIG. 1)inne odwołania do figur i nie wiem czy uznawać// overlap in many regions in the normal adult brain.

Chemokines are important regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, which largely explains how they contribute to controlling inflammatory processes in the brain.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.5</span> Neuro-glial cross-talk</h4>
<p>Having a diverse cellular distribution in the CNS, chemokines and their receptors plays a key role as mediators of homeostatic crosstalk between neurons and glia. <!-- Chemokines are key molecules in neuron-microglia communication in the developing and mature brain under both physiological and pathological conditions (de Jong et al., 2005). --><!--Efficient communication between cells is a key element in establishing and maintaining a healthy microenvironment essential for proper brain functioning. /// Figure 4 presents many different mechanisms regulating such communication, exemplified by CX3CL1, as their actions are the most studied. /// Depending on the context, chemokines by acting on glial cells can trigger different mechanisms of neuroprotection or neurotoxicity (for example: @lauro_2015). -->
Recently, in the light of the “glial revolution,” our long-held views of the functions of these cells were completely challenged.
Both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamics and heterogeneous cells, expressing a rich repertoire of ion channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, including CKRs.
Considering that glial cells constantly monitor brain parenchyma, these molecules might enable glial cells to sense not only local perturbation, but also neuronal activity, integrating it within glial networks. <!-- wcześniejsza trochę bardziej rozbudowana wersja z glia--><!-- Functional and molecular analysis of glial voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels underwent tremendous boost over the last 15 years. The traditional image of the glial cell as a passive, structural element of the nervous system was transformed into the concept of a plastic cell,  capable  of  expressing  a  large  variety  of  ion  channels  and  neurotransmitter receptors.  These  molecules  might  enable  glial  cells  to sense neuronal activity and to integrate it within glial networks, e.g., by means of spreading-->
Thus, it can be speculated that chemokines might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the influence of the environment to brain function and behavior.
Therefore, dissecting mechanisms of neuron-glial communications in the brain is of high importance, as identifying molecular targets may be used to counteract brain damage and preserve brain homeostasis. <!--This section will briefly introduce glial functions underlying their capacity to maintain homeostasis and an example of a chemokine-modulated cellular circuit. --><!--Among the many strategies used by cells to communicate one with another, the repertoire of chemokines constitutes one of the most tightly regulated systems. Often, a particular cell type is uniquely expressing the ligand for a receptor that is selectively found on another cell type, thereby conferring a high degree of specificity to the ensuing signaling [@allen_2007; @rossi_2000; @zlotnik_2000; @zlotnik_2012].  --><!-- Under those conditions, many chemokines are synthesized in activated astrocytes and microglial cells, suggesting their involvement in CNS defense mechanisms (Biber et al. 2007, Harrison and Lukacs 2007, Meucci 2010, Ransohoff et al. 1993) as well as in monocyte recruitment and migration into the CNS (Ransohoff 2009), (Semple et al. 2010)//// Chemokines are involved in virtually all pathologies that present an inflammatory component including nervous system disorders, such as neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory diseases. ///Under such conditions, a large number of chemokines and chemokine receptors are induced in activated astrocytes and microglia, suggesting their involvement in the activation of the CNS defense mechanisms [23,60,84,109]. --><!--Since, as reported in this review, all the cited chemokines can trigger different mechanisms o f neuroprotection, limiting apoptotic and excitotoxic cell death as well as inflammatory conditions, it can be speculated that upon noxious insult endogenous protective programs, such as the chemokine induced-chemokine release, might orchestrate neurons-microglia-astrocytes action to preserve and limit brain damage.--><!--Accordingly, another layer of complexity to neuronal information processing is added by astrocyte and microglia actions at synapses. // Recently, there was substantial "glial revolution" which completely challenged our view on both of these cells. --></p>

<!-- glia and synaptic plasticity 
A fundamental property of the mammalian brain is its ability to modify its function based on experience, and thereby to alter subsequent behavior. By changing the strength of transmission at preexisting synapses, transient experiences can be incorporated into the neuronal circuits as persistent memory traces during both development and adulthood. As such, synaptic plasticity is a fundamental mechanism that supports brain function (Buzsáki and Chrobak, 2005). Among the different factors that regulate synaptic plasticity, glial cells have been found to be key players in maintenance of synapse homeostasis (Eroglu and Barres, 2010). The biggest challenge when studying the effects of glial cells on brain activity is isolating the different cell-type components, i.e., neurons vs. glia. Recent research advances using various strategies, such as pharmacological or genetic manipulation and gene expression from viral vectors (Nimmerjahn and Bergles, 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Ben Haim and Rowitch, 2017), have allowed researchers to elucidate the role of glial cells in several aspects of brain function, and such knowledge may lead to the development of new therapies and biomarkers for many types of neurological dysfunction (Almad and Maragakis, 2018).

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.1</span> CX3CL1 structure</h4>
<p>CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels.
First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine δ family <span class="citation">(Pan et al., 1997)</span>. <!--((Pan et al., 1997))??.--><!-- Fractalkine is the only member of the CX3C chemokine family and, unlike many other chemokines, shares a one-to-one  relationship  with  its  cognate  receptor, CX3CR1 [@bazan_1997; @pan_1997]. -->
In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids <span class="citation">(Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)</span>.<!-- (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997)--><!-- (Rossi et al., 1998). -->
Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 70–80 amino acids <span class="citation">(Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012)</span>.
CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.
Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) <em>via</em> the action of several proteases (<span class="citation">Bajetto et al. (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Schulte et al. (2007)</span>, see Section <a href="introduction.html#chemosignal">1.1.1.3</a>). <!--(for example: @schulte_2007)(Garton et al., 2001).--><!-- The full-length molecule is also larger than most other chemokines, containing approximately 373 amino acid residues compared to the more common 70–80 amino acid size. // The 95 kDa full-length protein is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of  N-terminal chemokine domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane region and an intracellular C- terminal domain. It is converted to a soluble form on cleavage from the plasma membrane, through the action of metalloproteinases  (ADAM 10 and ADAM17 on leukocytes) (Hundhausen et al., 2003) or  cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) which is expressed and released by microglial cells in the spinal cord (Clark et al., 2007; Meucci et al., 2000; Ransohoff, 2002).The approximately 70 kDa soluble N-terminal chemokine domain can be released from the full-length protein via the action of several metalloproteinases such as cathepsin S, ADAM10, and ADAM17 (TACE: TNF-α-converting enzyme) in both the periphery and CNS (Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2013).  --><!-- FKN is a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal chemokine domain attached to a long, highly glycosylated mucin-like stalk with a short membrane-spanning domain and intracellular domain. 
FKN can be cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10, ADAM 17, and cathepsin S to generate a soluble fragment [2–4] (Fig.1).  Both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of FKN are capable of signaling through CX3CR1, although there may be differences in affinity and biological activity between these two ligands [1]. In the periphery, membrane-bound FKN can promote adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells, and the soluble ligand can cause chemotaxis of monocytes, T cells, and natural killer cells [51,52]. 
Genetic ablation of FKN causes reduced monocyte survival and reduced ability of CX3CR1+macrophages to sense the gut lumen [53]. Expression of the chemokine domain of FKN was sufficient to rescue survival of certain populations of monocytes @finneran_2019-->

While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration <span class="citation">(Ransohoff, 2009)</span>. <!-- it is believed that the binding of soluble CX3CL1 to its receptor CX3CR1 maintains microglia in a ‘‘resting” or ‘‘off” state (Bachstetter et al., 2011; Valero et al., 2016), although chemoattractant properties have been demonstrated for the membrane-bound form of CX3CL1 (Lauro et al., 2006; Song et al., 2013). /// In cx3cl1 − / − mice, the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-mediated gene insertion of either soluble or membrane bound synthetic variant of CX3CL1 demonstrated that, in a MPTP- model of PD, only the soluble form rescued motor coordination, reduced neurodegeneration and microglia activation ( Morganti et al., 2012 ). /// The unique transmembrane structure of CX3CL1 raises the possibility of additional functional regulation by altering its abundance at the cell surface. This could be accomplished in principle by changes in traffic between subcellular compartments. To analyze this possibility we examined the subcellular distribution of CX3CL1 in human ECV-304 cells stably expressing  untagged  or  green  fluorescent  protein tagged forms of the chemokine. CX3CL1 was present in two distinct compartments, diffusely on the plasma membrane and in a punctate juxtanuclear compartment. The latter shared some features with, yet was distinct from the conventional endocytic pathway and may represent a specialized recycling subcompartment. Accordingly, surface CX3CL1 was found to be in dynamic equilibrium with the juxtanuclear vesicular compartment. Intracellular CX3CL1 co-localized with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptor) proteins syntaxin-13 and VAMP-3. Cleavage of VAMP-3 by tetanus toxin or impairment of syntaxin-13 function by expression of a dominant-negative allele inhibited the ability of internalized CX3CL1 to traffic back to the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate the existence of a dynamic, SNARE-mediated recycling of CX3CL1 from the cell surface to and from an endomembrane storage compartment. The intracellular storage depot may serve as a source of the chemokine that could be rapidly mobilized by stimuli. [@liu_2005] Importantly, neither of these phenotypes was altered by transgenic expression of the soluble CX3CL1 isoform, suggesting that it is the membrane-anchored version of CX3CL1 that regulates microglial phagocytosis of A and neuronal MAPT phosphorylation. Analysis of transcript levels in purified microglia isolated from APPPS1 mice with the various CX3CL1/CX3CR1 genotypes revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic markers, which was associated with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and A internalization within microglia. Together, these studies challenge the “frustrated phagocytosis” concept and suggest that neuronal–microglial communication link the two central AD pathologies. [Lee_2014] --></p>

In addition, synaptic stripping, which is the physical separation of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements by intervening microglial processes, is well documented upon injury (Kettenmann et al., 2013). - Acharjee2018b---><!-- Given the role of microglia in regulating synapse number (Tremblay et al., 2011; Stephan et al., 2012; Schafer et al., 2013; Wuet al.,2013, 2015), ...--><!--Among their numerous functions, microglia is emerging as extremely dynamic in their once presumed “resting” state, continuously sampling the extracellular space and contacting pre- and post-synaptic elements with their highly motile processes (Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010).

<!-- neuroprotection and soluble vs membrane- anchored-->
<p>In animal models, knocking down CX3CR1 signaling exacerbated microglia over-activation, increasing the release of IL-1 β and apoptotic neuronal cell death in mice injected with LPS, and increased neuronal cell loss in PD and ALS mouse models ( Cardona et al., 2006 ).
In cx3cl1 − / − mice, the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-mediated gene insertion of either soluble or membrane bound synthetic variant of CX3CL1 demonstrated that, in a MPTP- model of PD, only the soluble form rescued motor coordination, reduced neurodegeneration and microglia activation ( Morganti et al., 2012 ).
A role for endogenous CX3CL1 in the attenuation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype was also reported in a mouse model of Tauopathy ( Lastres-Becker et al., 2014 ).
Recent data show that only the over-expression of a specific cleavage variant of the soluble CX3CL1 reduced Tau-pathology ( Finneran and Nash, 2019 ).</p>
<!-- neuroprotective - neurodegenerative models-->
<p>Disruption of FKN signaling has also been studied in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.
In a seminal paper, Cardona et al. <span class="citation">(Cardona et al., 2006)</span> described the impact of CX3CR1 knock out in several models of neurodegeneration. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Broadly, they found that microglia lacking CX3CR1 are cytotoxic in models of systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Mice lacking CX3CR1 were more susceptible to neuron loss upon systemic injection of LPS.
Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Cx3cr1−/−microglia from LPS-challenged mice into wild-type mice also produced neurotoxicity in the area of the injection site. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Interestingly, microglia lacking CX3CR1 did not migrate away from the injection site whereas microglia with intact CX3CR1 signaling migrated from the injection site. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Inhibition of IL-1β signaling blocked the neurotoxic effects of and restored the migratory capacity of Cx3cr1−/− microglia. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
Similarly, in the SODG93Amouse model of ALS, disruption of FKN signaling caused greater neuron loss, reduced hindlimb strength, and shortened lifespan. <!-- Finneran 2019-->
In a toxic model of PD, loss of FKN signaling by knocking out either the receptor or the ligand resulted in significantly greater neurotoxicity <span class="citation">(Cardona et al., 2006)</span>. <!-- Finneran 2019--></p>

<p>The high basal level of CX3CL1 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus is suggestive of a physiological, non-inflammatory function. <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 -->
Indeed, there is mounting evidence which implicates both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Piccinin et al., 2010; Maggi et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011; Roseti et al.,2013; Scianni et al.,2013). <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 --></p>
<p>Specifically,
In hippocampal cultures, CX3CL1 reduced neuronal cell death due to gp120- or glutamate overexposure ( Meucci et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2005 ). <!-- zmienić -->
Microglial cells treated with CX3CL1 release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection in mixed hippocampal neuron – glia cultures. <!-- zmienić -->
Among them, adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection through the activation of adenosine A1 receptor subtype (A1R) ( Lauro et al., 2008, 2010 ). <!-- zmienić -->
Acting on microglia, CX3CL1 indirectly modulates the activity of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) on astrocytes, with higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and this effect requires the function of A1R ( Catalano et al., 2013 ). <!-- zmienić -->
In a pMCAO rat model, i.c.v. injection of soluble CX3CL1, 30 min after ischemia, has long lasting protective effects, reducing lesion volume and neurological deficits, again with the involvement of active A1Rs ( Cipriani et al., 2011).<!-- zmienić -->&lt;
CX3CL1 is neuroprotective against Glu-induced excitotoxicity, with mechanisms fully dependent on A1 R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010) and in part dependent on A 3 R (Rosito et al., 2014).
CX3CL1 also protects neurons against NMDA-induced death (Deiva et al., 2004), but no evidence of ARs involvement are reported so far. <span class="citation">Lauro et al. (2014)</span></p>
<p>For example, CX3CL1 has been shown to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and post-synaptic glutamate currents (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005). <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 -->
The latter effect has been linked to increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit (Ragozzino et al., 2006).<!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 -->
These synaptic effects are consistent with a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons most likely exerted through the CX3CR1 receptor, which is reportedly expressed on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Meucci et al., 2000; Limatola et al., 2005). <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 -->
Overall, previous studies indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, perhaps as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006; Turrigiano, 2008; Piccinin et al., 2010). <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 -->
Consistent with this hypothesis, neuroprotective ADAM17-mediated increase in soluble CX3CL1 is observed in multiple settings of glutamatergic neurotransmission where the chemokine is suggested to perform a neuroprotective function (Chapman et al., 2000; Tsou et al., 2001; Erichsen et al., 2003; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2010; Pabon et al., 2011). <!-- zmienić -Sheridan2014 --></p>
<p>CX3CL1-mediated neuroprotection and neuromodulation may also require the activity of adenosine-type 2 a receptors (A2ARs). <!-- zmienić -->
Scianni et al. (2013) demonstrated that CX3CL1 modulates the NMDA glutamate receptor function and that this effect involves the release of D-serine from glial cells, and the activity of A2AR subtype. <!-- zmienić --></p>
<p>Altogether these data describe a mechanism by which CX3CL1, via A2AR and D-serine, and likely modulating synaptic NR2A/NMDARs, induced CREB phosphorylation, upregulation and release of BDNF, resulting in neuroprotection and neuromodulation ( Lauro et al., 2015). <!-- zmienić --></p>
<p>In the hippocampus, a region crucial for cognition, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce the amplitude of both synaptic <span class="citation">(Ragozzino et al., 2006)</span> and AMPA-evoked currents <!--with a mechanism that involves inhibition of forskolin-induced Ser-845 GluR1 phosphorylation--><span class="citation">(Lauro et al., 2008; Ragozzino et al., 2006)</span>, suggesting a postsynaptic mechanism.

In the same area it has been reported that: i) CCL2 exerts pre-synaptic effects increasing the release of glutamate onto CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Zhou et al., 2011 ); ii) CXCL16 enhances both the release of glutamate and GABA, requiring adenosine type 3 receptor (A3R) and microglia activation ( Di Castro et al., 2016 ).  /// zmienić Trettel 2020--></p>

Further evidence indicates that the activation of A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>3</sub>R results in a decrease in synaptic transmission, whereas A<sub>2A</sub>R exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-induced increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC) in the blockade of A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>3</sub>R receptors <span class="citation">(Piccinin et al., 2010)</span>.</p>

Therefore, the CX3CL1-induced adenosine release may affect glutamatergic neurotransmission by a mechanism involving a combination of three different AR subtypes and both glutamatergic receptors.
Nevertheless, the opposite effects of CX3CL1 on AMPAR and NMDAR functions are nicely correlated with the difference between A<sub>3</sub>R/A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R receptors.
Moreover, the depressed glutamatergic transmission following CX3CL1 and adenosine application corresponds with results from studies of synaptic plasticity (see: Section <a href="#LTP"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<p>As described in the section on synaptic plasticity (see: <a href="#LTP"><strong>??</strong></a>), several chemokines were documented to modulate LTP in the hippocampus, a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory <span class="citation">(Bolós et al., 2018; Necula et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2016)</span>. <!-- pewnie jeszcze zmienić -->
Of these chemokines, CX3CL1 is the best characterized in this context.
Nevertheless, behavioral studies on the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in the regulation of learning and memory were giving contradictory results (see: Table 3).<!-- poprawna nazwa tabeli  // Of note, there is great controversy regarding the behavioral phenotype of *CX3CR1-/-* mice in the literature (Paolicelli et al., 2014).-->

It should be noted that findings from studies of synaptic plasticity correlate with behavioral output (see Table 1 and 2). <!-- tabeleeee -->
Those discrepancies may result from differences in housing conditions, animal gender, and age, or behavioral test protocols between laboratories. <!-- In each study involving behavioral studies with these animals, the relevance of housing conditions, animal gender and age, feeding and behavioral test protocols is brought to light (Gemma and Bachstetter, 2013). -->
However, this issue warrant further clarifications.</p>
<p>Moreover, dysfunctions in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CX3CR1 KO mice were further confirmed in CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices <span class="citation">(Basilico et al., 2019)</span>. <!-- ale during development ? -->
Recordings from slices of transgenic mice displayed an immature AMPA/NMDA ratio with defective AMPA components and decreased release probability when compared to wild-type mice.
These results illustrate that neuron–microglia interactions profoundly influence the functional maturation of excitatory presynaptic function. <!-- zmienić --></p>
<p>Importantly, Sheridan et al. <span class="citation">(Sheridan et al., 2014)</span> reported that the CX3CL1 application in the hippocampus has opposing effects on glutamate-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients depending on whether it was applied alone or simultaneously with a GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker, picrotoxin.
These results highlight the possible modulation of CX3CL1 in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition on the network level.
However, whether the chemokine system participates in feed-forward inhibition signaling remains an open question for future research.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in the section on synaptic transmission (see: <a href="#Glu"><strong>??</strong></a>), in the CA1 hippocampus, CX3CL1 induced phosphorylation of AMPA subunit GluR1 at postsynaptic sites <span class="citation">(Ragozzino et al., 2006)</span>, which is one of the hallmarks of the LTD.
Moreover, one group reported no difference in LTD in the hippocampus between adult wild-type and knockout mice.<!--cytowanie-->
In contrast, LTD is enhanced in CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> mice at P13 <span class="citation">(Paolicelli et al., 2011)</span>, suggesting that CX3CL1 has the highest relevance during early postnatal age.</p>
<p>However, similar electrophysiological studies indicated either a complete lack of LTP in knockout mice <span class="citation">(Rogers et al., 2011)</span> or a more pronounced LTP than in wild-type counterparts when LTP was induced by a weak stimulation protocol <span class="citation">(Maggi et al., 2011)</span>.
Interestingly, when mice were housed in an enriched environment compared to wild-type mice, they had enhanced plasticity <span class="citation">(Maggi et al., 2009)</span>.
These results suggest that the absence of microglia-driven CX3CR1 signaling impedes enrichment effects, possibly due to some shared mechanisms that warrant further investigation. <!-- coś nie w porządku z tym zdaniem -->
It is speculative that this lack of beneficial response to environmental stimulation might be explained by altered microglia–neurons cross-talk, affecting the circuitry underlying synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Regarding the DG, CX3CL1 decreased the LTP at those synapses; however, when GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were blocked, the magnitude of the LTP was enhanced <span class="citation">(Sheridan et al., 2014)</span>, indicating that the CX3CL1-exerted actions may differ based on inhibitory/excitatory balance (see: Table 2).
Alternatively, noting the CX3CL1-induced potentiation of NMDA function and thereby the increase in calcium transients <span class="citation">(Scianni et al., 2013)</span> together with the inhibition of the LTP induction following NMDAR activation, it is also possible that CX3CL1-induced elevated level of intracellular calcium could interfere with the LTP induction <span class="citation">(Scianni et al., 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>These inconsistent findings between laboratories might result from differences in age, gender, diet, housing conditions, or electrophysiological protocols.
Especially age and gender could be relevant, as the same laboratories cannot replicate their results when those variables had differed.
Hence, effects on synaptic plasticity and behavioral outcomes resulted from the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis may be transient and quickly compensated in knockout mice.</p>
<p>Chemokine regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus.
CX3CL1 was shown to induce synaptic depression of evoked parallel fibers inputs onto Purkinje neurons <span class="citation">(Giovannelli et al., 1998)</span>, and mice with CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> receptor deletion were characterized by the LTP in the spinal cord <span class="citation">(Bian et al., 2015)</span>.
Future research should clarify whether mechanisms underlying CX3CL1-induced synaptic plasticity are general.<br />
However, it would be implausible, considering that (i) microglia displays many region-specific features, especially when compared in cerebellum and cortex <span class="citation">(Stowell et al., 2018)</span>, (ii) CX3CR1-induced microglial during development are region-specific <span class="citation">(Lowery et al., 2017)</span>, as well as (iii) mechanisms governing LTP may differ between structures, for instance, between the hippocampus and spinal cord <span class="citation">(Liu et al., 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>In particular, by measuring connections between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, mice with deletion of CX3CR1 revealed a decrease in the coherence between those two structures, compared to their wild-type littermates (<span class="citation">Zhan et al. (2014)</span>, see Fig 4D).<!-- !-->
Thus, this finding suggests that the depletion of CX3CR1 leads to a decrease in hippocampal–prefrontal connectivity, which may have behavioral consequences, such as anxiety or cognitive impairments <span class="citation">(Zhan et al., 2014)</span>.<br />
Moreover, knockout mice showed reduced frontal cortex oscillatory driving to the hippocampus than their wild-type littermates at baseline conditions <span class="citation">(Zhan, 2015)</span>.
It is speculative whether it is the consequence of morphological modifications of microglia depleted of CX3CR1 <span class="citation">(Piirainen et al., 2021)</span>, but scanty evidence is available so far. <!-- tutaj może poprawić tę drugą część zdania...-->
Nevertheless, these results highlight a fundamental role of CX3CL1 at the network level.
Hence, considering those findings and accumulating evidence of glial impact on the network, investigating chemokines’ role in neural networks may be an exciting direction in the future.</p>

The ability of CX3CL1 to inhibit glutamate function is thought to be responsible for some of its neuroprotective actions, and provides further support for the chemokine-neuromodulatory role in the CNS <span class="citation">Guyon and Nahon (2007)</span>. <!-- not sure if it is my sentence Overall, previous studies indicate a predominantly inhibitory role for CX3CL1, perhaps as a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006; Turrigiano, 2008; Piccinin et al., 2010).-->
Consistent with this hypothesis, neuroprotective ADAM17-mediated increase in in soluble CX3CL1 is observed in multiple settings of glutamatergic neurotransmission where the chemokine is suggested to performa neuroprotective function (Chapman et al., 2000; Tsou et al., 2001; Erichsen et al., 2003; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2010; Pabon et al., 2011). <!-- zmienić--></p>

<p>CX3CL1 has been reportedly up-regulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission where the chemokine is clearly protective against excitotoxic cell death (Tong et al., 2000; Tarozzo et al., 2002; Limatola et al., 2005; Cipriani et al., 2011; Briones et al., 2014). Moreover, both CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, have been shown to be up-regulated in hippocampal neurons after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Yeo et al., 2011), a condition characterized by excessive glutamatergic excitation. Overall, the abundance and expression pattern of CX3CL1 make the chemokine ideally suited for sensing hippocampal glutamate tone. Our data supports a possible role for CX3CL1 in homeostatic mechanisms of synaptic scaling during memory-associated synaptic plasticity.-Sheridan2014</p>

<!-- #### different fragment - different functions 
There is some evidence that different fragments of the FKN ligand may have different functional outcomes. 
Fractalkine signaling has been implicated in neuropathic pain in spinal injury models [77–79]. 
In these studies, neuropathic pain in injury models was alleviated by antibody antagonization of CX3CR1, and in non-injured rats neuropathic pain was induced by activation of CX3CR1 with intrathecal injections of exogenous fractalkine peptide comprising just the chemokine domain. 
Furthermore, Clark and Malcangio [15] show that infusion of this chemokine peptide of FKN (ckFKN, Fig.1) elicits mechanical allodynia, while infusion of sFKN (which contains the full mucin-like stalk, Fig.1) does not. 
They also demonstrate a difference in calcium mobilization upon binding between these two fragments. Interestingly, it has been identified that cathepsin S is necessary for the production of pain-inducing FKN in a spinal injury  model  [2,77].  
In  silico  analysis  of  substrate preference of cathepsin S indicates membrane-bound FKN as a potential substrate  (Biniossek et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2007; Jones et al. 2013; Ruckrich et al. 2006) and a recent study published that cathepsin S cleaves membrane bound FKN to generate a soluble fragment that migrates at  a  lower  apparent  molecular  weight  than  the ADAM10/17 cleavage product [83]. 
These data suggest that removal of the mucin-like stalk (either partially or in whole) may alter the microglial response to FKN, which can elicit different effects and/or microglial phenotypes depending on the identity of the soluble ligand.

These data may indicate that the form of the soluble fragment (with or without the mucin stalk) affects how the chemokine signals in these neurodegenerative models and that proteolytic cleavage could be a mechanism for regulation of fractalkine activity in vivo. 
More research is needed to determine if there are differential effects of these soluble FKN variants and how this could regulate neuroinflammation. finneran_2018-->
<!-- morphology and activation 
Microglial morphology reflects their functional activation state (Zanier et al., 2015). In the unchallenged state, surveillant microglia present a ramified morphology, highly motile processes that interact with synapses, whereas upon “activation,” their processes typically retract as the cell body becomes hypertrophied (Tremblay et al., 2010a). “Activated” microglia are also well known to display an increased expression of IBA-1 in various contexts of injury and disease (Norden et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). We have previously shown that electron microscopy (EM) can reveal the functional state of microglia in a highly sensitive manner (Tremblay et al., 2010a). // Microglia are extremely plastic and microglial activation has been associated with specific morphologic changes; during activation, microglia retract their processes, resulting in decreased occupied area and increased soma size.9 - Yuan2020 // Microglia can react rapidly to infection, trauma, and other danger signals, by retracting their processes and enlarging their cell body. However, microglial phenotypes vary depending on the type of stimulus and by brain region (Morrison and Filosa, 2013; Abiega et al., 2016). Genome-wide analyses of microglia of different CNS regions showed that cerebellar and hippocampal microglia exist in a more vigilant state than do microglia in other brain areas (Grabert et al., 2016). Even within the hippocampus, the microglia of area CA3 are more sensitive to LPS compared with those of CA1 or dentate gyrus (Madore et al., 2013). Thus, it is not surprising that we saw different effects in BLA compared with what another group reported in the striatum./// In damaged brain, microglial processes rapidly rearrange toward the site of injury (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008). To reach the site of activating stimuli, microglia retract their cellular processes and rearrange them in a directional manner toward the lesion. In addition, a marked change in ionic channel expression has been observed (Boucsein et al., 2000). Indeed, in acute brain slices non-activated microglia frequently display a small linear conductance, while following nerve lesion (Boucsein et al., 2000) or status epilepticus (Avignone et al., 2008) they transiently express inward and outward rectifier potassium (K+) currents (Menteyne et al., 2009; Kettenmann et al., 2011).

Significance
How and what kind of microglia modulate synapses in the adult brain are still poorly known, particularly in adult animals, although previous studies have revealed evidences on synaptic phagocytosis or nibbling by neonate and adolescent microglia (Paolicelli [@piirainen_2020] /// Understanding the mechanisms of microglia communication in the brain is important to identify molecular players that can be used as targets to counteract brain damage and preserve brain homeostasis.-->

Interestingly, although stress resilience has been described in CX3CR1-/- mice (Rimmerman et al., 2017; Yirmiya et al., 2015), other authors found that these animals show greater depressive- like behavior in response to inflammation compared to WT counterparts (Corona et al., 2013). -->
<!--###### Pharmacological blockade of microglia - minocycline

####### what it is 
Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, is well known for its antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive effects. 
minocycline has been recognized as playing two mainly independent roles: it is a microglial inhibitor as well as a second- generation tetracycline. 
Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, is well known for its functions, such as neuroprotection or antihypernociception, that have been identified in the last decade, and it typically acts by blocking microglial activation and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production (Yong et al., 2004). - Peng

Minocycline, a second-generation, broad spectrum, semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic is of particular interest as an analgesic, in addition to its anti-microbial effect. 

###### function

Minocycline effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier (Aronson, 1980) and has a proven safety record in humans (Thomas and Le, 2004).
Minocycline mediated inhibition of microglial activation has been reported to reduce nociception in inflammation-evoked pain (Hua et al., 2005), spinal cord contusion injury (Hains and Waxman, 2006) and spinal nerve ligation (Lin et al., 2007). 

Recent reports suggests that minocycline inhibits Na+ channels in the primary afferent neurons (Kim et al., 2011) and also inhibits phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) expression in the spinal cord (Cho et al., 2012), supporting a neuronal target for minocycline. 
Therefore, it is possible that the observed analgesic effect of minocycline in this study might not be exclusively through glial inhibition, but rather a combined effect on glial cells and neuronal targets. However, further experiments are warranted to identify these targets - Kannampalli2014

While the majority of these studies attribute the analgesic effect of minocycline to inhibition of microglial activation (Tikka et al., 2001; Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013), some studies have also reported on its action on other targets like astrocytes (Zhang et al., 2012) and neurons (González et al., 2007). 
While reports indicate that minocycline has no direct effect on the neurons, González et al. (2007) have reported that minocycline is associated with the mitigation of neuronal excitability, glutamate release, and Ca2+ overloading in hippocampal neurons. - Kannampalli2014

####### synaptic transmission 
Modulation of synaptic transmission is one of the analgesic mechanisms of minocycline. 
Although it has been reported that minocycline may suppress excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, it remains unclear whether it could affect inhibitory synaptic transmission, which also plays a key role in modulating pain signaling. - Peng2016

Minocycline affects dopamine (Hashimoto et al. 2007) and glutamate transmission and depresses Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal neurons (González et al. 2007). 
Furthermore, there is enough evidence that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells. 
Microglia secrete proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, proteases, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6) and excitatory amino acids, which can affect neural activity as well as neuronal circuit involved in drug addiction (Coull et al. 2005; Niwa et al. 2007b; Yirmiya & Goshen 2011). Minocycline can affect expression of these factors. 
It has been shown that minocycline is able to upregulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tumor necrosis factor-α (Chen et al. 2012b).
- Arezoomandan2018


Moreover, the effect of minocycline may differ on different types of neurons. 
For example, minocycline (50 nM) had no effect on basal excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 (Pascual et al., 2012) or SG neurons (Berta et al., 2014); however, 100 lM minocycline may inhibit dorsal root entry zone stimulation-elicited EPSCs in SG neurons (Cho et al., 2006) or may decrease sEPSC frequency and amplitude in hippocampal neurons (Gonzalez et al., 2007). 
At a concentration of 200 lM, minocycline may decrease C-fiber evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating an inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission (Zhong et al., 2010). 
In addition, minocycline at 500 lM abolished the mustard oil-induced glutamatergic-dependent central sensitization in medullary dorsal horn nociceptive neurons (Itoh et al., 2011). 
The above observations suggest that minocycline may decrease neuronal excitability in a concentration- and cell-type-dependent manner by decreasing glutamatergic transmission. 
In addition to excitatory input, neurons also receive inhibitory synaptic transmission. 
If minocycline could modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission, then IPSC frequency or amplitude must be influenced by minocycline. 


#### CX3CR1 expression? Przejście

However, its constitutive expression in different CNS cells ( Ludwig et al., 2005; Rosito et al., 2012 ) suggests additional roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication. 

Synaptic transmission is explicitly related to dendritic spines, as these tiny, actin-rich, postsynaptic protrusions from a dendrite, receive most of the excitatory synaptic input in the brain. 
Functional and structural changes in dendritic spines are also critical for synaptic plasticity (see Section: \@ref(network)), a cellular model of learning and memory. 

Moreover, the spine morphology is highly dynamic: it could vary within the same dendritic arbor and thus is  interdependently regulated. 

In agreement with glial contribution to synaptic functions, astrocytes [@perezalvarez_2014], microglia [@paolicelli_2011], and oligodendrocytes [@zemmar_2018] are implicated in interactions with dendritic spines in a highly active-dependent manner.

The finding that chemokines exert a neuromodulatory role in the brain is essential for a better understanding of the complex communication network between neurons and cells from their surrounding microenvironment. 
This section illustrates the emergent concept of chemokine coordination of neural networks, such as neuroendocrine functions, GABA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, and synchronized oscillatory activity.

Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of chemokines regulation of  proper neural network functioning by their effects on interneurons migration and maturation.

Synaptic plasticity is defined as a molecular form of learning, memory, and development in neural circuits.
It mainly comprises such mechanisms as Hebbian plasticity, synaptic scaling, and adult neurogenesis. 
Among different factors regulating synaptic plasticity, glial cells have been considered key players in maintaining synapse homeostasis [@deluca_2020; @field_2020; @kettenmann_2011; @mederos_2018]. 

Hebbian synaptic plasticity is the earliest and most widely accepted neurobiological theory of memory consolidation. 
According to this concept, a synapse will be strengthened if the presynaptic neuron is active while the postsynaptic neuron is firing, a process called Hebbian modification. 

Considering the relevance of chemokines' role in neurodevelopment (i.e., neuronal/axonal migration and synaptic pruning), it can be hypothesized that proper chemokine signaling during neurodevelopment is of high importance to provide functional connectivity between many cortical regions. 
However, to date, there is a scarcity of data on this topic.

<!--microglia and process - advanced microscopy
Microglial processes constantly survey the brain parenchyma,transiently contact neuronal elements, and can also engulf cellular debris and eliminate synapses. Using immunocytochemical EM against IBA-1, we found direct contacts between microglial process and neuronal perikarya, as well as presynaptic elements, postsynaptic elements, and synaptic clefts. Synaptic elements showing signs of autophagy were also frequently contacted by microglia in both CFA and EAE. Microglial inclusions, sometimes containing recognizable synaptic elements that probably resulted from phagocytosis, were occasionally encountered in both conditions. In addition, features associated with extracellular digestion or “exophagy” (Haka et al., 2016), such as microglial processes in association with extracellular space pockets that contained partially to completely disrupted cellular membranes, as well as synaptic elements, were observed. These features are suggestive of ongoing extracellular digestion, either mediated by microglial remodeling of the extracellular matrix or release of lysosomal proteins. The prevalence of extracellular digestion was significantly reduced in EAE. Accordingly, the expression of CD68 in IBA-1-labeled cells, a lysosome-associated protein often used as a marker of microglial “activation” or “phagocytosis” was significantly reduced in the BLA of EAE mice compared with CFA controls.// In contrast, a recent study with microglial gene profiling using microarray analysis revealed suppression of microglial genes during the early stages of EAE development; specifically, the genes related to their phagocytic functions and cytoskeleton organization were suppressed (Yamasaki et al., 2014). This suppression could have multiple effects, such as reduced phagocytosis, cytokine, chemokine, and metalloproteinase production (Shemer et al., 2015).//Reduced extracellular spaces between the neuron and microglia were also observed in the EAE amygdala. These spaces generally contained material undergoing digestion in the CFA controls (synaptic elements that could be identified or membranes in a more advanced state of digestion), suggesting a reduced pruning of synaptic materials in EAE (Haka et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2016).;;-->

<!-- subcellular
Confocal imaging of CXCR4 immunostaining as presented in this study clearly showed that in neurons of the caudate putamen the receptor is mostly located along the plasma membrane of perikarya and dendritic processes. Furthermore, CXCR4 in this region is also expressed in beaded Æbres that resemble varicosed axonal processes. A similar pattern of CXCR4 labelling was observed in the substantia innominata (not shown). This reinforces the hypothesis that CXCR4 activation could modulate synaptic transmission (Limatola et al ., 2000). Interestingly, a markedly different cellular localization of CXCR4 was observed in neurons from other brain regions such as the lateral hypothalamus. In these neurons, CXCR4 labelling was punctate and apparent throughout the cytoplasm of the perikaryon, and was barely visible in dendritic processes. This indicates that the cellular localization of CXCR4 may vary depending on the type of neurons that express the receptor. Although the functional consequences of this observation are unclear at present, it may suggest that speciÆc cellular mechanisms of CXCR4 addressing and trafÆcking could operate in different neuronal populations [@banisadr_2002a]-->

(1998)</span>; see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:cxcl12sig">1.4</a>).
These molecules activate several intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review: <span class="citation">Britton et al. (2021)</span>, <span class="citation">Ward (2006)</span>).<br />
PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). <!-- /// In parallel, CXCR4-oriented migration is mediated by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which can be activated by both Gβγ and G α subunits [45]. -->
IP3 production leads to increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC).

However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 was also able to signal <em>via</em> β-arrestin pathway <span class="citation">(Rajagopal et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011)</span>.
Moreover, although CXCR4 and ACKR3 are activated by the same chemokine, they signal through different pathways (β-arrestin vs. G-coupled).
Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a β-arrestin biased receptor (see: <a href="#biasedsignaling"><strong>??</strong></a>).
Nonetheless, more recently, it was shown that ACKR3 has functionality independent of the β-arrestins.
Specifically, <span class="citation">(Montpas et al., 2018)</span> demonstrated that both siRNA knockdown of β-arrestin 1 and or β-arrestin2 in HEK293 cells does not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of ACKR3’s ligands (e.i., CXC11 and CXCL12).
In addition, the following studies further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels following the activation of PTX-sensitive G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins, leading to proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes <span class="citation">(Odemis et al., 2010)</span>.<br />
Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: <span class="citation">Bajetto et al. (2001)</span>), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor <span class="citation">(Odemis et al., 2012)</span>.
These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells.
Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist <span class="citation">(Burns et al., 2006)</span>, resulted in activation of β-arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting <span class="citation">(Odemis et al., 2012)</span>.<br />
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR.<br />
However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Cx43 internalization in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner <span class="citation">(Fumagalli et al., 2020)</span>, whereas CXCR4 leads to NF-Kβ activation with consequent TNF-α and glutamate release from these cells <span class="citation">(Bezzi et al., 2001; Calì et al., 2008; Calì and Bezzi, 2010)</span>.
Therefore, these data suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions <em>via</em> different signaling pathways in astrocytes, indicating that, in particular cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling <span class="citation">(Heuninck et al., 2019)</span>.</p>

<p>Similar to CX3CL1, CXCL12 is also involved in neurodevelopment.
For example, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was demonstrated to guide interneurons (for example: <span class="citation">Casoni et al. (2012)</span>) and promote the maturation of GABAergic neurons during this period <span class="citation">(Luo et al., 2008)</span>.
Consistently, perturbations of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling lead to premature cortical plate invasion by cortical interneurons and, in the long term, disturbance in their laminar and regional distribution <span class="citation">(López-Bendito et al., 2008)</span>, leading to the dysfunctional neural network.</p>
<p>Interneurons are guided to the correct cortical layer via CXCL12 gradients while ACKR3 acts as a sink to collect excess CXCL12. <span class="citation">(Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2011)</span> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Similarly, Saaber et al. demonstrate that ACKR3 chemokine scavenging and endocytosis is dependent on receptor phosphorylation but independent of β-arrestins.

Neuronal growth and synapse formation can also be achieved by a phenomenon called giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs).
GDPs are spontaneous network-driven rhythmic-like large neuronal oscillations in the developing hippocampus, formed by GABA, exerting depolarizing and excitatory actions during postnatal development. 
CXCL12 was reported to tonically inhibit GDPs,  further highlighting the role of this chemokine in neuronal development [@benari_2002].Moreover, they are modulated by external factors, including chemokines, such as  CXCL12 and CX3CL1 [@meucci_1998; @liu_2003; @sheridan_2014].??? sprawdzić czy nie chodzi o calcium -->
<p>Again, analogous to CX3CL1, CXCL12 is also implicated in the regulation of neurogenesis.
It has been shown that the development of adult DG neural stem cells is regulated by the release of GABA from neurons of this type (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).
Release of CXCL12 within the DG neural stem cell niche is able to enhance GABAergic transmission to neural stem cells (Ge et al. 2007; Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).
<!--We observed that CXCL14 had essentially the opposite effect and could inhibit GABAergic inputs to these cells.-->
<!--The GABAergic input to DG neural stem cells takes the form of both tonic and phasic transmission.
Interestingly, both tonic and phasic effects of synaptically released GABA were inhibited by CXCL14. -->
We also observed that some cells responded to both CXCL12, which enhanced, and CXCL14, which decreased GABAergic transmission to nestin-expressing cells.
Hence, it seems likely that CXCL12 and CXCL14 represent ‘up’ and ‘down’ volume controls that can regulate GABA inputs to neural stem cells in a reciprocal fashion.
The fact that CXCL14 and CXCL12 are also both contained in DG GABAergic interneurons (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008) increases the probability of a meaningful connection between the effects of these three molecules in the control of DG neuron development in the adult.
By comparison neither CXCL14 nor CXCL12 altered GABAergic transmission to mature granule cells in the DG (Figure S3 and Bhattacharyya et al. 2008).</p>
<p>CXCL12/CXCR4 pair modulates cerebral cortex (Bagri et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2003; Stumm and Höllt, 2007) and cerebellar (Ma et al., 1998; Zou et al., 1998) development.
In adult brain, high expression of CXCR4 has been reported in neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular region and in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, the two major niches of neuronal stem cells in the adult brain (Stumm et al., 2002; Berger et al., 2007).
The expression of CXCL12 in the hippocampal granular layer regulates the generation and the positioning of new granule neurons (Abe et al., 2018), as well as axonal elongation and sprouting (Pujol et al., 2005; Lysko et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012).
According to its role in neurogenesis, the upregulation of CXCL12 upon stroke (Wang et al., 2012), or demyelination (Carbajal et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2014) contributes to generate new cells and to restore normal CNS functions <!-- tRETTEL2020--></p>

<p>Evidence indicates that CXCR4 can also affect NMDAR.
For instance, CXCR4 receptors were shown to be presynaptically located in hippocampal noradrenergic and glutamatergic nerve endings.
They were connected with presynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting that CXCR4-NMDAR interactions can regulate both noradrenaline and glutamate exocytosis <span class="citation">(Di Prisco et al., 2016)</span>.
Moreover, in the cerebellum, CXCR4 activation results in a decrease in NMDAR function, and thus, leads to synaptic depression <span class="citation">(Ragozzino et al., 2002)</span>, probably by CXCL12-induced reduction in NR2B expression subunit of NMDAR <span class="citation">(Nicolai et al., 2010)</span>.
CXCR4 is also widely expressed on microglia, and thus being able to react to astrocytic glutamate. <!-- najlepiej rozbudować --></p>
<p>Interestingly, by acting on presynaptic site, CXCL12 seems to affect neurons in the DRN, SN, hypothalamus, and in turn, modulate release of such neuromodulators as serotonin, dopamine, MCH, respectively. <!-- CXCL12 also induces a presynaptic increase of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission onto serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe, onto cortical immature neurons upon transient MCAO and onto dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra (SN) ( Guyon et al., 2006; Heinisch and Kirby, 2010; Ardelt et al., 2013 ). --></p>

<p>Like CX3CL1, CXCL12 was also found to modulate GABAergic synaptic transmission onto serotoninergic neurons.
CXCL12 was shown to increase sIPSC frequency, which may inhibit the excitability of serotoninergic cells and the release of its neurotransmitter.
In contrast CX3CL1 increases the amplitude of sIPSCs and eIPSC, without affecting PPR, increasing the sensitivity of serotoninergic neurons to GABA inputs and consequently inhibiting 5-HT neurotransmission <span class="citation">Heinisch et al. (2011)</span>.</p>

<p>Evidence from another electrophysiological study has illustrated that CXCL12 increases the release of GABA from hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, which affects the excitability of these cells in a dose-dependent manner <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2005a)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, CXCL12 was reported to co-localize with neurons releasing neuropeptides, such as vasopressin (AVP)<!-- also called arginine vasopressin--> and melanin-concentrating hormone (MHC) in posterior pituitary neurons, and substance P in DRG neurons (see Sections: <a href="#cell"><strong>??</strong></a>).<!-- nie wiem co się złego stało z , \@ref(autocrine) --><!-- cytowania? -->
These findings suggest that CXCL12 cognate receptor, CXCL12, is involved in the autocrine regulation of these neurons.
Consistent with this idea, CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels of the action potential in MCH neurons <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2005a)</span>, or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents in hypothalamic neurons <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2005b)</span>.
Moreover, this chemokine is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: ). <!-- cytowanie z CXCL12 --><!-- CXCL12 is stored in vesicle like structures within neurons which seem to be neurotransmitter storage vesicles (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008). --></p>
<p>Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings of supraoptic neurons have demonstrated that CXCL12 decreases the electrical activity of AVP neurons <em>via</em> CXCR4, resulting in modifications in AVP release.
In addition, intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12 were illustrated to significantly inhibit the release of AVP induced by high plasma osmolarity <span class="citation">(Callewaere et al., 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus, a brain region comprised of different nuclei and several neuronal populations producing neuropeptides, is critically involved in the regulation of major neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and also stress.</p>
<p>Depending on the concentration, CXCL12 is thought to exert opposite effects on the action potential discharge <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2005a)</span>, which may have functional consequences on the activity of neuroendocrine networks.
Specifically, CXCR4 is tonically active at low physiological concentrations, constantly exerting its action on MCH neurons.
Under basal conditions, those cells showed more hyperpolarized membrane potential than orexin neurons, which do not express CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Eggermann et al., 2003)</span>.
Moreover, CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia.
Consistently, a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides, such as enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH in the PVN and perifornical lateral hypothalamus <span class="citation">(Poon et al., 2016)</span>.
Importantly, intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic those effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus, suggesting a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior <span class="citation">(Poon et al., 2016)</span>.
<!-- Both SDF-1 and GABA have been shown to  regulate the rate of GnRH neuronal migration by accelerating and slowing migration, respectively.

GABA and SDF-1 were also found to act  synergistically to promote linear rather than random movement. The simultaneous activation of these signaling pathways, therefore,  results in tight control of cellular speed and improved directionality along the migratory pathway of GnRH neurons.  --></p>

<p>These data strongly suggest that the CXCL12 can act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of HVA currents.
Moreover, in the same neuronal population, CXCL12 application leads to an increase in an inward current resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX).
It was speculated that its source might be glutamate secreted from non-neural cells <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2006)</span>.
As CXCR4 was not present on astrocytic cells in the SN <span class="citation">(Alice Guyon et al., 2008)</span>, thus this inward current likely resulted from the activation of CXCR4 on microglia.

Consistently, immunohistological analyses revealed that astrocytes in this structure lacked CXCR4, further supporting the possibility of astrocytic mediation <span class="citation">(Guyon et al., 2006)</span>.
Considering abovementioned expression of another ACKR3 receptor in astrocytes, it is possible that this receptor is responsible for this CXCL12-induced increase in glutamate.
However, the exact mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release still warrants further investigation.<!-- CXCL12 a increased glutamate release in SN slices, as previously described in other brain structures such as cerebellum (Ragozzino et al . 1998) or hypothalamus (Guyon et al . 2005b). This current was not blocked by TTX, suggesting that it did not involve action potential-dependent release through the glutamate terminals. Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices. Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12 a . However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12 a . It is therefore likely that CXCL12 a induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice. It is well established that CXCL12 a mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 a effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. The mechanism of action of CXCL12 a on glutamate release thus needs further investigation. --></p>
<p>Unlike in the SN, astrocytes cultured from the cerebral cortex presented the high expression of CXCR4 <span class="citation">(Calì et al., 2008)</span>.
Moreover, CXCR4 activation was reported to trigger a burst of exocytosis, <!--on a millisecond time scale -->leading to the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores in those cells <span class="citation">(Calì et al., 2008)</span>.
These results further support the notion that astrocytes can respond to external stimuli and communicate <em>via</em> fast release of glutamate on a millisecond time scale <span class="citation">(Calì and Bezzi, 2010)</span>. <!-- Interestingly, astrocytic synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) express vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), and they can release glutamate by Ca^2+^-dependent regulated exocytosis [@cal_2008]. both in tissue and in cultured astrocytes-->

<p>Convincing evidence illustrates that opioid receptors and CKRs are often co-expressed in the same neuron and can directly interact, thus each influencing the function of the other (see Section: <a href="gaba.html#cxcl12">11.5.0.6</a>).
The most studied mechanism in this regard is the heterologous desensitization, where the activation of one type of GPCR receptor leads to the inactivation of another GPCR receptor present in the same cell.
Consistent with this idea, following CXCL12 exposure, the heterologous desensitization of opioid receptors has been linked to functional outcomes at cellular (e.g. reduced chemotaxis <span class="citation">(Szabo et al., 2002)</span>) and electrophysiological (e.g. decreased morphine-induced hyperpolarization in PAG neurons in the presence of CXCL12 <span class="citation">(Heinisch et al., 2011)</span>) levels. <!-- Phosphorylation is an   essential step for heterologous desensitization.

Thus, it is suggested that ACKR3 serves scavenger functions for many opioids, especially enkephalins and dynorphins, by reducing their availability for their classical opioid receptors <span class="citation">(Meyrath et al., 2020)</span>.
Accordingly, treatment with ACKR3 agonist LIH383, even at high concentration, did not produce any electrophysiological effect in PAG<!--or locus coruleus?--> neurons, confirming the scavenging function of ACKR3 in this brain region.
Interestingly, in the presence of the ACKR3 agonist, dynorphin A improved its potency towards its classical receptors, which resulted in more significant inhibition of neuronal firing than in the absence of ACKR3 activation <span class="citation">(Meyrath et al., 2020)</span>.
These findings suggest that ACKR3 regulates opioid peptide availability, and consequently its signaling through their classical receptors <span class="citation">(Meyrath et al., 2020)</span>, adding another level of complexity and fine-tuning to the opioid system but also opens additional therapeutic opportunities.</p>
<p>Consistent with this idea, ACKR3 was reported to bind intermediate opioid peptides, specifically BAM22 and peptide E, which results in enhancement of circadian glucocorticoid oscillation in the adrenal glands, and, therefore, anxiolytic-like behavior <span class="citation">(Ikeda et al., 2013)</span>. <!-- może poprawic albo wrocić do innej wersji? -->

<p>/////////////////
The first evidence that CXCL12 has effects on neurons and promotes neuroprotection were given by Meucci et al. (1998) when, for the first time, the authors demonstrated that CXCL12 reduced the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons induced by gp120 or by glia deprivation. Following glia deprivation, neuroprotection was promoted by administration of CXCL12 specifically to neurons highlighting a direct activity of the chemokine on these cells. Further, stimulation of hippocampal neurons with CXCL12 was able to induce Akt phosphorylation and p65NF-kB nuclear translocation, both signaling implicated in pro-survival cell fate ( Khan et al., 2004 ).
Accordingly, in primary cortical neurons, CXCL12 promotes Rb function increasing its expression, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity and reducing the excitotoxic cell death due to NMDA receptors over-activation ( Khan et al., 2008 ).</p>
<p>CXCL12 neuroprotection is also sustained by an increase in the pro-survival signaling of synaptic NMDA receptor, and in the down-regulation of the extrasynaptic NR2B-NMDA receptor subunit (whose activity is known to mediate neurotoxicity) ( Nicolai et al., 2010 ).
Since all the experiments presented in the above cited papers were performed using neuronal cultures with a separate astrocytes layer, it cannot be excluded that the neuroprotective effects might be also mediated by glial cells.
Indeed, CXCL12 stimulates astrocytes promoting Akt phosphorylation ( Khan et al., 2004 ), G-protein-PI-3Kinase-ERK1/2 signaling cascade leading to cell proliferation ( Bajetto et al., 2001b ), NF-Kb activation with consequent TNFα (Han, 2001) and glutamate</p>
<p>Recently it has been reported that gliptin (Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 DPP-4 inhibitor) improves motor functions and reduces tissue damage upon MCAO, increasing the cerebral level of CXCL12 ( Chiazza et al., 2018 ).
Since CXCR4 antagonist reduced gliptin induced functional recovery ( Chiazza et al., 2018 ), it was speculated that CXCL12 represents an endogenous modulator counteracting brain damage.
The upregulation and the release of CXCL12 from astrocytes was also observed in the ischemic penumbra ( Stumm et al., 2002; Hill et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2005 ).
In vitro, ischemia alters the expression of miRNAs associated with CXCL12 regulation, leading to increased CXCL12 expression and release from astrocytes ( Shin et al., 2014 ).
In addition, acting on microglial cells, CXCL12 activates signaling pathways that trigger the release of IL-6 ( Lu et al., 2009 ), which has neuroprotective properties in ischemia ( Loddick et al., 1998; Ali et al., 2000; Ohtaki et al., 2006 ).
Another novel neuroprotective activity of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been identified in its ability to increase dendritic spine numbers ( Pitcher et al., 2014 ).
In particular authors found that, in opiate abuser and in neuroAIDS patients, deregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 is determinant to cognitive dysfunction associated with dendritic spine loss. The authors also demonstrated that CXCL12/CXCR4 regulates dendritic spine density both in vitro, in pure neuronal cultures, and in vivo, in a rat model of opiate abuse.
CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling plays a role in neuroprotection also in Alzheimer disease: CXCL12 protected neurons from A β -induced apoptosis through the activation of Akt, ERK1/2 and the maintenance of metalloproteinase ADAM17 and, in vivo, counteracted the oxidative damage and the loss of spine density in the hippocampus (Raman et al., 2011 ).
Furthermore, a decreased expression of CXCL12 was observed in the brain of Tg2576 and in 3XTg AD animal models at the stage of cognitive decline, as well as in brain tissue from AD patients ( Parachikova and Cotman, 2007).</p>
<p>In adult brain, high expression of CXCR4 has been reported in neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular region and in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, the two major niches of neuronal stem cells in the adult brain ( Stumm et al., 2002; Berger et al., 2007 ). The expression of CXCL12 in the hippocampal granular layer regulates the generation and the positioning of new granule neurons ( Abe et al., 2018 ), as well as axonal elongation and sprouting ( Pujol et al., 2005; Lysko et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012 ). According to its role in neurogenesis, the upregulation of CXCL12 upon stroke ( Wang et al., 2012 ), or demyelination ( Carbajal et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2014 ) contributes to generate new cells and to restore normal CNS functions. Postnatal development of neurons in the cortical layer V depends on CX3CL1 signaling, which regulates the release of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) by microglia, important for survival of these neurons ( Ueno et al., 2013 ).</p>
<p>However, CXCL12 exhibits broad tissue expression including brain, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and bone marrow.
CXCR4 can be considered as a node which is integrating and transducing inputs from a range of ligand-receptor interactions into a responsive and divergent network of intracellular signaling pathways that impact multiple cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and stress resistance.</p>
<p>CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), originally termed Fusin due to its role in cell-cell fusion12 and its expression was first described in peripheral blood leukocytes and subsequently in hematopoietic stem cells, B-lymphocytes, epithelial, endothelial, stromal fibroblasts, and cancer cells.13</p>

<!-- another tissue development and tumors
ACKR3 is also involved in cardiac tissue development along with CXCR4 and CXCL12 (Sierro et al., 2007).
Although poorly expressed in normal adult tissues, ACKR3 is widely expressed in a variety of tumors and tumor-associated vessels and appears to promote tumor growth and neoangiogenesis partly by signaling *via* mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (Maksym et al., 2009). /// The ability of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in directing stem cell homing is probably related to its prominent role in directing the metastatic destination of tumor cells as well (Zlotnik et al., 2011) ///  --></p>
<!-- CXCR4 and neurodevelopment -->
<p>These developments underscore the important roles that CXCR4 plays in development. <!-- zmienić -->
Other studies have documented that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays pivotal roles in homing of various stem cells to particular places of the embryo during development. <!-- zmienić -->

In the developing and mature brain, virtually all types of CNS cells such as neural progenitors, neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes as well as endothelial cells of brain blood vessels are targets for CXCL12 (Li and Ransohoff, 2008). <!-- ŁADNE ZDANIE ALE TROCHĘ ZMIENIĆ -->

<!--cxcl12 functions-->
<p>A recognized function of CXCL12 in the mature CNS is the control of intercellular communication between brain cells (Bezzi et al., 2001; Rostene et al., 2007).
In the injured CNS, CXCL12 regulates inflammatory processes (Cartier et al., 2005; Li and Ransohoff, 2008) and promotes tissue regeneration by recruiting neural progenitor cells to the site of injury (Tran et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Banisadr 2016: ACKR3 in the brain (Schönemeier et al. 2008a , b ; Shimizu et al. 2011 ). Knowledge of the precise expression pattern and characterization of cells expressing ACKR3 is required to further explore the function of ACKR3 in the brain. It is well established that CXCL12/CXCL12 is constitutively expressed by endothelial and neuronal cells in various regions of the adult rat brain (Tham et al. 2001 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Banisadr et al. 2003 ) and the expression patterns of CXCL12/CXCL12 and CXCR4 have been well established in structures associated with various functions such as their role in adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation among other functions (Banisadr et al. 2002 ; Stumm et al. 2002 ; Tissir et al. 2004 ;Tranetal. 2007 ).</p>
<p>Subsequent worked suggested that ACKR3 can act to preserve CXCL12 gradients and CXCR4 sensitivity to CXCL12 62 as well as to enable tighter control of such gradients and of cell migration, for example, for guidance of interneurons in the cortex and of B cells in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.63-65</p>
<p>CXCL12, a chemokine, is involved in primordial germ cell migration (Blaser et al., 2005), migration of neural progenitors (via its receptor CXCR4) and axon growth and branching during development of the nervous system (Tran and Miller, 2003; Pujol et al., 2005).
Recent work has shown that GABA and CXCL12 may act synergistically to alter cell movement (Seidel et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008). <span class="citation">(Casoni et al., 2012)</span></p>
<p>CXCL12 has been shown to act in the brain as a neurotransmitter (Banisadr et al., 2005) and to be released with GABA from inhibitory neurons (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008). However, <span class="citation">(Casoni et al., 2012)</span></p>
<p>CXCL12 induced changes in saltatory GnRH movement were shown to occur through a GIRK dependent mechanism. GIRK channels open via a signal transduction cascade triggered by the G bc dimeric protein released by activated G protein- coupled receptors (Dascal, 1997; Yamada et al., 1998). Opening of the GIRK channel results in permeability to potassium ions and hyperpolarization of the cell. To date, only melanin- concentrating hormone neurons (involved in feeding behavior regulation) have been shown to respond to CXCL12 directly through GIRK current activation and in these cells, CXCL12 influenced neuronal activity (Guyon et al., 2005). <span class="citation">(Casoni et al., 2012)</span></p>
<p>Finally, we addressed the striking mismatch between intense CXCR4 mRNA expression (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Tissir et al., 2004; Tran et al., 2007) and weak CXCR4 protein expression in the SGL (Stumm et al., 2002).
Studies in non-neuronal cell lines showed that CXCR4 is sequestered from the cell surface (internalized), sorted to lysosomes, and degraded after agonist stimulation (Orsini et al., 1999; Marchese and Benovic, 2001). Therefore, the mismatch between CXCR4 mRNA and CXCR4 protein in the SGL may reflect tonic activation and turnover of CXCR4 by endogenous CXCL12</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3.8.1</span> Astrocytes</h5>
<p>Since the tripartite synapse concept emerged in 1999 <span class="citation">(Araque et al., 1999)</span>, it is well-established that astrocytes are involved in the dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission (for example: <span class="citation">Araque et al. (2014)</span>).
To react to changing microenvironment, they are endowed with a great variety of voltage and ligand-operated ion channels <span class="citation">(Kofuji and Araque, 2021)</span>.
Astrocytes display a wide variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly relevant in astrocytic signaling, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations are thought to integrate environmental information and generate functional outputs, such as releasing gliotransmitters, including glutamate, D-serine, GABA, ATP, adenosine, or TNFα <span class="citation">Guerra-Gomes et al. (2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, astrocytes are enriched in gap junctions, by which they form broad cellular networks comprised of hundreds of cells, allowing for the intercellular diffusion of ions, second messengers, cyclic AMP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, ATP, among others.
Gap junctions are formed by connexins, mainly by Cx43 and Cx30, which differ in their expression.
Despite their scale, such networks were illustrated to preferentially couple one astrocyte over the other.
Therefore neighboring astrocytes may not necessarily be connected by gap junctions, and such preference may be of functional relevance.
Moreover, gap junction networks were demonstrated to play an essential role in complex brain functions, including cognition and behavior (for a review: <span class="citation">Guerra-Gomes et al. (2017)</span>).
As ACKR3 was demonstrated to induce the internalization of Cx43 <span class="citation">(Fumagalli et al., 2020)</span>, future studies aimed at establishing its functional significance and whether other chemokine receptors may elicit similar actions are warranted.</p>
<p>/////</p>
<p>Astrocytes, which were considered as supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, network oscillations <span class="citation">Mederos and Perea (2019)</span>.
To react to changing microenvironment, they are endowed with a great variety of voltage and ligand-operated ion channels <span class="citation">Kofuji and Araque (2021)</span> as well as they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters <span class="citation">Covelo and Araque (2018)</span>.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission. <!-- nie podoba mi się to zdanie -->
Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews <span class="citation">Bazargani and Attwell (2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites and synapses (Montagnese et al., 1988; Ventura and Harris, 1999; Khan et al., 2001; Witcher et al., 2010), and their endfoot processes associate with vascular endothelial cells and pericytes (Liebner et al., 2018), being ideally positioned to monitor and regulate both synaptic activity and blood brain barrier. The close association between astrocytes and neuronal synapses is a critical factor required for the maintenance of brain homeostasis (Perea et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Astrocytes are integral elements of synapses in developing rodent and human cerebral cortices [ 30 – 32 ].
A single cortical astrocyte is estimated to contact 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans [ 30 ].
Several lines of evidence suggest that, through this close association with neurons, astrocytes alter synaptic functions.
Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission [ 33 , 34 ], long-term potentiation [ 34 – 40 ], and long-term depression [ 15 ] in several brain areas, as well as provide a developmental switch of synaptic transmission from LTD to LTP in hippocampus [ 41 ].
More and more details about astrocytic cellular and subcellular mechanisms have recently been presented [ 40 , 42 – 49 ].
It is of interest to understand how these subcellular mechanisms in astrocytes and their processes are linked with synaptic transmission and plasticity in neocortex [ 13 , 15 , 42 , 50 , 51 ]. <span class="citation">(Manninen et al., 2020)</span></p>
<p>They are prominently found in proximity of nerve terminals, sensing neural activity and being activated during synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>Astrocytes can also modulate synaptic transmission by releasing transmitters</p>
<p>In agreement with this hypothesis is the observation that astrocyte stimulation in mice’s primary sensory areas increases neural firing beyond stimulation (Perea et al., 2014; Poskanzer et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Astrocytes are specialized cells, organized in non-overlapping domains within the CNS parenchyma and coupled into multicellular networks via gap junctions ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010 ). Astrocytes are essential for brain homeostasis affecting: i) the blood – brainbarrier (BBB) integrity; ii) the cerebral blood fl ow, fl uid, ion, pH and transmitter homeostasis; iii) the synaptic function, being components of the (tripartite) synapsis and releasing gliotransmitters; iv) the CNS metabolism regulating energy supply to neurons ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010 ). Upon acute brain insults or chronic brain diseases (such as neurodegenerative disease, brain tumor, epilepsy) astrocytes become reactive and undergo morphological, transcriptional and functional changes that can be either bene fi cial or detrimental ( Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Liddelow and Barres, 2017 ). <!--Trettel2020--></p>
<p>A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote synapses formation, are defective in phagocytosis, and release soluble factors that induce apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes ( Zamanian et al., 2012; Liddelow et al., 2017 ). A2 reactive astrocytes might have protective/reparative functions, since they upregulate neurotrophic factors and thrombospondins (which promote synapses repair) ( Liddelow and Barres, 2017 ). These and other evidence support the notion that the interplay among neurons, microglia and astrocytes orchestrates the endogenous response to limit brain damage upon toxic insult. <!--Trettel2020--></p>
<p>Observational studies from postmortem human tissues have revealed that human astrocytes are much larger and more complex than their murine counterparts (Oberheim et al., 2006, Oberheim et al., 2009). More recently, transplantation of human glial progenitors into mouse brains has been shown to improve learning and memory (Han et al., 2013). These observations raise questions about how murine astrocyte physiology and function might extend to humans. Are there distinct properties of human astrocytes that contribute to human intelligence and cognition? Can we extend findings about astrocyte pathology in neurological disorders from mouse and rat studies to develop effective therapeutic approaches in humans?</p>
<p>Interestingly, the GABA transporters (GATs) GAT-1 and GAT-3 show particular cellular and sub-cellular distributions throughout the brain (Ribak et al., 1996; Boisvert et al., 2018). GAT-3 is the most abundant GAT in astrocytes and is localized in astrocytic processes that are adjacent to synapses and cell bodies, but are also close to basal and apical dendrites (Boddum et al., 2016), while GAT-1 can be found in distal astrocytic processes and is more abundant in neurons (Borden, 1996; Scimemi, 2014).</p>
<p>Glial cells continuously monitor the neural parenchyma and any disturbance or loss of CNS homeostasis (e.g. infection, trauma, ischaemia, neurodegenerative diseases or altered neuronal activity) evokes morphological changes and alterations in the gene expression pattern of microglia, a process called microglial activation [16]
Glial cells are crucial for the maintenance of correct neuronal functionality in a physiological state and intervene to restore the equilibrium when environmental or pathological conditions challenge central nervous system homeostasis.</p>

Sickness behavior is considered to be the physiological and psychological effect of immune activation during the course of infection, which is primarily mediated by the central action of peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines. <!-- zmienić -->

<p>As mentioned above, CX3CL1 is the most widely studied chemokines in relation to neuron–microglia crosstalk and regulation of microglial activity.
<!-- However, CX3CL1-induced microglial neuroprotection is modulated by other factors, such as glial-soluble factors that synergistically contribute to neuroprotection.-->

<!--Upon CX3CR1 activation, CXCL16 was reported to be secreted from astrocytes and microglia (see Fig. 3B, @rosito_2012).
CXCL16, consequently, acts on astrocytes by inducing the additional release of CCL2, with a mechanism that requires adenosine A3 Receptor subtype (A~3~R) activity (see Fig. 3C, @wittendorp_2004, @rosito_2012, @rosito_2014). 
Notably, other soluble factors that mediate CXCL16-dependent neuroprotection cannot be excluded since blocking CCL2 activity dramatically reduces, but did not entirely abolish, its ability to preserve neurons (Fig. 3C, @rosito_2012).
Therefore, mechanisms  underlying the neuroprotective activity of CX3CL1-induced CXCL16 require the neuronal-astrocytic-microglial interplay and the activity of the A3R, with consequent release of CCL2 by glial cells. -->

These results highlight that modulation of glial function by adenosine is essential in the context of neuroprotection, as both microglia and astrocytes release it as a gliotransmitter. <!-- neuroactive substances--></p>
<p>Additionally, it is well-established that astrocytes might also exert a neuroprotective role upon brain insult by buffering extracellular Glu <span class="citation">(Bélanger and Magistretti, 2009)</span>.

Microglia can also release CXCL12, which then acts, for example, <em>via</em> astrocytic CXCR4 and, in turn, produces TNFα, leading to remyelination (see Fig.3F,G, <!-- właściwe odwołanie do figury--><span class="citation">Bezzi et al.

<p>To sum up, the mentioned above findings strongly support the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines are key communicating molecules between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserving brain functions.
Please note that this is a simplification of neuron-microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in the context of neuroprotection, and many other factors and connections are omitted for the sake of clarity. <!-- coś takiego dodać ? // Please note that this section only aims to demonstrate that the effect of microglia-dependent actions on neurons may also be mediated via other cell types and not intended to give a comprehensive review of inter-glial interactions. /// It has been shown that in neurons CXCL12 triggers intracellular pathways ( Khan et al., 2005, 2008 ) that can upregulate the transcription of cx3cl1 gene such as NF-Kb and p53 ( Shiraishi et al., 2000 ). Cook et al. (2010) showed that CXCL12 increases the shedding of neuronal CX3CL1, likely via up-regulation of neuronal ADAM17, suggesting that, in addition to the direct neuroprotective activity of CXCL12, its ability to induce CX3CL1 release may further facilitate neuronal recovery after excitotoxic insults. CX3CL1, in turn, can elicit the release of soluble CXCL16 from astrocytes and microglia, and A3R and CCL2, mediators of CXCL16 neuroprotective activity, represent active player in CX3CL1 protection against excitotoxic-insult ( Rosito et al., 2012 ). In line with these data, the neuroprotection induced by CX3CL1 against ischemic insult is significantly reduced in mice that lack CXCL16 signaling ( Rosito et al., 2014 ). The above mentioned findings strongly corroborate the concept that, in the CNS, chemokines could represent key endogenous modulators of the cross-talk between neurons and glia cells aimed at preserve brain functioning ( Fig. 1 ). --></p>
<!--### Chemokines modulates behavior {#behavior}

Since mounting evidence supports the notion that chemokines coordinate several brain circuits of behavioral relevance, including hippocampus, DRN, SN, hypothalamus, it may indicate their contribution to these behaviors.
Consistent with this idea, disturbances of several chemokines/chemokine receptor axes were implicated in the pathophysiology of neurobiological disorders [@paolicelli_2014; @poon_2016; @stuart_2015].
Moreover, despite increasing evidence about the chemokine system's role in mediating homeostatic brain functions, the mechanisms underlying chemokines regulation of behavior under physiological conditions remains largely unknown. 
Hence, here I discuss a handful of studies on the regulation of chemokines on various types of behavior, such as learning and memory, social interactions, locomotor activity, anxiety. 
Results from those studies are summarized in Table 3. 

To sum up, these findings reinforce the idea that chemokines and their receptors are involved in higher brain functions regulating many types of behavior, including cognitive, motor, and emotional behavioral effects.
However, to date, very little is known about their cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological profile with regard to potential interaction with glia to put these results in a broader context. // and glial-mediated mechanisms to put these results in a broader context.///

// dobre połączenie z AMYGDALA///
Although many brain regions have been found to participate in anxiety regulation it is commonly accepted that among them the amygdala plays a prominent role (Canteras et al., 2010; Davis and Whalen, 2001; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Engin and Treit, 2008; Everitt et al., 2003; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000, 2007; McNally et al., 2011; Pape and Paré, 2010; Paré et al., 2004; Pérez de la Mora et al., 2008, 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2009).

Several behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, commonly occur in mice with CX3CR1 deletion. -->
<!-- 
All neuronal circuits of higher animals comprise excitatory and inhibitory neurons forming intense feed-forward and feedback connections [@mohler_1990, @ferrante_2009, @roth_2012].
However, the precise control of network operations would not be possible without interneurons.
Although they constitute only 20-30% of all cells in cortical circuits, this small, diverse group of inhibitory neurons enables higher brain functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, or social interaction (for a review: @mederos_2019). 
Through inhibition, GABAergic interneurons can shape the circuit activity controlling (1) frequency of surrounding pyramidal neurons, (2) network excitation level by feed-forward mechanism, and (3) synchronized oscillation events [@mederos_2019]. 
The importance of interneurons in relation to network functioning illustrates the highly controlled manner by which interneurons connect with other neurons [@tremblay_2016]. 

##### Synaptic scaling {#scal}

In order to prevent the destabilizing component of Hebbian plasticity in network function, neurons are able to sense their excitability and trigger negative-feedback homeostatic mechanisms to counteract perturbations in synaptic activity and restrain it within a dynamical but physiological range [@field_2020]. 
Recent accumulating data also highlight the essential role of glial cells, as they are equipped with, for instance, glutamate transporters to control the concentration of glutamate and other neurotransmitters in the microenvironment. 
Importantly, stable but flexible neural activity is fundamental for proper brain function and support of animal behavior, depending on a dynamic interface between homeostatic synaptic  plasticity  mechanisms  and  Hebbian  forms  of plasticity [@field_2020; @tremblay_2016].-->
<p>Taken together, as expected from their complex expression of cellular pattern and dynamic chemokine-receptor<!--może inne określenie--> interactions, chemokines modulate intrinsic membrane properties, synaptic transmission, and gliotransmission by implementing diverse cell- and region-specific mechanisms.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Amygdala</h2>
<p>The amygdala, a complex comprised of a heterogeneous collection of nuclei, is located in the medial temporal lobe.
Its nuclei can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: <span class="citation">Duvarci and Pare (2014)</span>).
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of this structure, there is no<!--anatomical--> standardization of amygdaloid nuclei terminology. <!-- although there is no standardization in relation to correct term, -->
Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) <span class="citation">(McDonald, 1998; Sah et al., 2003)</span>.
Here, the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA), and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers (<span class="citation">Bocchio et al. (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Duvarci and Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Ehrlich et al. (2009)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape and Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Spampanato et al. (2011)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere <span class="citation">(Pitkänen et al., 1997; Sah et al., 2003)</span>. <!--check citations and more? --></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Functions</h3>
<p>This limbic region is involved in surprisingly distinct behaviors related to learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction <span class="citation">(Ehrlich et al., 2009; Herry et al., 2010; LeDoux, 2000; Roozendaal et al., 2009)</span>.
At first glimpse, this variety of functions could be surprising, but most of them are related<!--inne słówko // reduced?--> to associative learning, i.e., fear conditioning and its malfunctions.
In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can mobilize<!--inne słówko?--> adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. <!-- lepiej napisać to zdanie --><!-- plus dodać tutaj o modelu? -->
This form of learning is termed Pavlovian conditioning.
For example, during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, such as a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, such as freezing behavior <span class="citation">(Janak and Tye, 2015; LeDoux, 2000)</span>.
Therefore, the amygdala has been conserved throughout evolution.
Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and fishes have a counterpart with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals <span class="citation">(Janak and Tye, 2015)</span>.
Amygdala is also an important player in tuning autonomic responses to homeostatic challenges, including those of the peripheral immune system <span class="citation">(Pacheco-López et al., 2005)</span>. <!--więcej cytowań / lepiej napisać-->
Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, determine how genetically targeted cellular activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for example, <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>). <!-- lepiej to napisać ... with ,-->
Moreover, the amygdala is well-documented to have<!--inne słówko--> widespread connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci and Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Pape and Pare (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>), further supporting the notion that this structure could influence other parts of the brain, and thereby, distinct behaviors mediated by those regions. <!-- figure ? illustrating amygdala as a hub?-->

<!-- Anatomy and Physiology? // As a group, amygdala nuclei receive inputs from and project to virtually all levels of the central nervous system. -->
</div>
<div id="BLAstructure" class="section level3" number="1.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA)</h3>
<p>The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (<span class="citation">Krettek and Price (1978)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>). <!-- nowsze cytowania? -->
All these nuclei are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter this term will be used.
The BLA is considered to be the main point of the entry for cortical and thalamic sensory inputs into the amygdala, which form axonal bundles and enter <em>via</em> external and internal capsule, respectively (for reviews: <span class="citation">Duvarci and Pare (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Lalumiere (2014)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah and Lopez De Armentia (2003)</span>).
This complex displays cortical-like characteristics based on its developmental origin and structural organization <span class="citation">(Waclaw et al., 2010)</span>, although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization <span class="citation">(Sah et al., 2003)</span>.
Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons <span class="citation">(Duvarci and Pare, 2014; McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Spampanato et al., 2011)</span>.</p>
<div id="BLAcells" class="section level4" number="1.2.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1</span> Neuronal Composition</h4>
<!-- choć może cellular i tutaj też astrocyty? -->
<p>Principal cells (PCs) show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal pyramidal counterparts.
In the BLA, PCs represent a rather heterogeneous group, forming subpopulations based on both morphological and electrophysiological features <span class="citation">(Faber et al., 2001; Funahashi et al., 2000)</span>.
Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).<!--  see figure? -->
<!-- Reflecting ..?? Based on their morphological profile, -->However, these cells may vary in soma volume <span class="citation">(Klenowski et al., 2015)</span> and/or shape (triangle vs. stellate-like morphology) as well as a structure of dendritic trees <span class="citation">Paré et al. (1995)</span>, reflecting the morphological heterogeneity of PCs population.
Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections (<span class="citation">Faber et al. (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Paré et al. (1995)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
The degree of this adaptation forms a continuum. <!-- the degree of the spike frequency adaptation of PCs forms a continuum: -->
At one end, cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation <span class="citation">(Faber et al., 2001; Funahashi et al., 2000)</span>. <!-- może jakiś figure i trochę lepiej napisać? see Fig. in methods?-->
Moreover, more prominent spike frequency adaptation was associated with more prominent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and higher expression of calcium-activated potassium channels in those cells <span class="citation">(Faber et al., 2001; Faber and Sah, 2002; Sah, 1996)</span>. <!-- HERE: additional electrophysiological features of principal cells /// Additionally, another electrophysiological characteristics of principal neurons in BLA are: relatively wide  action potentials (half-width = 1.2 ms), ....., .....-->
Additionally, a small subset of PCs displays bursting activity, which is thought to be due to the presence of low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current <span class="citation">(Paré et al., 1995)</span>.
However, to what extent these differences in firing patterns reflect distinct principal cells’ subpopulations and their functional significance is still unclear. <!-- może zmienić trochę bardziej? -->
Moreover, morphological and electrophysiological features of PCs are not inter-correlated <span class="citation">(Faber et al., 2001; Funahashi et al., 2000)</span>. <!-- nie wiem czy to nie gdzieś indziej albo wywalić --></p>
<p>BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of parameters, which was a subject of many excellent reviews <span class="citation">(Hájos, 2021; Prager et al., 2016; Spampanato et al., 2011)</span>.
In contrast to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald and Betette, 2001; McDonald and Mascagni, 2004; McDonald and Mascagni, 2002)</span>.
Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and chandelier cells (<span class="citation">McDonald (1982a)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff et al. (2010)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology <span class="citation">(Klenowski et al., 2015)</span>.
It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population, and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons <span class="citation">(Kemppainen and Pitkänen, 2000; McDonald and Betette, 2001; McDonald and Mascagni, 2002; McDonald and Mascagni, 2001; Muller et al., 2003)</span>. <!-- (Mascagni & McDonald, 2003) może zrobić figure? -->
Of note, these subpopulations can be further subdivided.
For instance, there is a subpopulation of SOM+ neurons, which expresses neuropeptide Y (NPY), whereas the PV group includes the basket and chandelier cells, also known as axo-axonic neurons (AAC), which will be discussed in the next section (<!--see: \@ref(BLAinside); -->for reviews: <span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>, <span class="citation">Prager et al. (2016)</span>, <span class="citation">Tremblay et al. (2016)</span>). <!-- PV+ basket cells (PVBCs) also express CB,  whereas PV+ AACs do not -->
Moreover, the relative ratios of interneuron types may differ between brain regions.
Within the BLA, they are roughly the same, except for PV-immunopositive interneurons.
As mentioned above, this subpopulation constitutes around 40% of BLA interneurons, except in the lateral subdivision, where PV-expressing cells represent only 20% of BLA interneurons. <!-- citation? --></p>
<p>Electrophysiologically, contrary to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously <em>in vivo</em> at high frequencies (10-15 Hz) <span class="citation">(Paré et al., 1995; Spampanato et al., 2011)</span>.
Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons <span class="citation">(Group et al., 2008)</span> but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004)</span>. <!-- see citations for figure -->
Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns <span class="citation">(Spampanato et al., 2011)</span>. <!--more recent reviews-->
Some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells (<span class="citation">Rainnie et al. (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff and Sah (2007a)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>), whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation <span class="citation">(Jasnow et al., 2009)</span>.
However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear.
Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: <span class="citation">Spampanato et al. (2011)</span>, <span class="citation">Tremblay et al. (2016)</span>).</p>

<p>Multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA (for a more comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Pape and Pare (2010)</span>, <span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>).
It is carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory, associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala <em>via</em> the external or internal capsules (for reviews: <span class="citation">Hájos (2021)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>). <!-- figure i cytowanie które nie jest review? // thalamic nuclei and secondary or higher-order sensory cortices besides the associative cortices-->
In most cases, those afferents project to both principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons (see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a).</p>
<p>A large body of evidence highlights the role of these terminals in the acquisition of fear conditioning <span class="citation">(Blanchard and Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux et al., 1990)</span>.
At the cellular level, principal cells in the BLA<!--, especially its lateral part,--> simultaneously receive initially weak afferent carrying sensory information about the CS (e.g., terminals from the auditory thalamus and cortex) and a strong input carrying US information (e.g., footshock).
Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, <span class="citation">Nabavi et al. (2014)</span>).
Accordingly, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), <span class="citation">Kim and Won (2017)</span> found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Analogous to fear conditioning, reward-induced conditioning responses<!--the acquisition of conditioned responding to both fear and reward cues--> are also associated with a synaptic potentiation in the BLA, leading to a cue-triggered behavior <span class="citation">(Clem and Huganir, 2010; Johansen et al., 2010; Tye et al., 2008)</span>.<!-- nowsze cytowania  -->
These findings further support the notion that both learning about danger and potential rewards is adaptive and engages the amygdala <span class="citation">(Janak and Tye, 2015)</span>.
Moreover, increasing evidence shows that distinct subpopulations of BLA differentially encode valence.
Accordingly, optogenetic studies delineated that the BLA-NAc pathway is preferentially excited by appetitive stimuli, whereas BLA-CeA connections are preferentially activated by aversive ones <span class="citation">(Beyeler et al., 2016; Namburi et al., 2015; Pignatelli and Beyeler, 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to pyramidal-like neurons, local interneurons also receive, to some extend, inputs from cortical and thalamic afferents <span class="citation">(Smith et al., 2000; Woodson et al., 2000)</span>.
For example, CB-expressing interneurons receive about a half of the cortical inputs <span class="citation">(Unal et al., 2014)</span>, whereas thalamic neurons project to less than 1% of BLA interneurons <span class="citation">(Szinyei et al., 2000)</span>.</p>
<p>The glutamate and GABA transmission within the BLA is strongly modulated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a).
Specifically, this region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2) serotonergic projections originating from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), (3) dense dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN), and (4) projections from the basal forebrain (<span class="citation">Prager et al. (2016)</span> and references therein).</p>

<div id="BLAinside" class="section level5" number="1.2.2.2.2">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.2.2</span> Intrinsic connectivity</h5>
<p>As described above, computations performed by BLA circuits to control emotional responses are heavily influenced by a myriad of inputs conveying both sensory and cognitive information.
The subsequent generation of emotional responses by the BLA is largely determined by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to BLA principal cells which are tightly controlled by GABAergic interneurons <span class="citation">(Bocchio et al., 2016; Capogna, 2014; Hájos, 2021; Spampanato et al., 2011)</span>.
Thus, here, I briefly discuss our current understanding of the connectivity of this complex neuronal network.</p>
<p>Principal cells are densely interconnected between subdivisions of the BLA complex by sending long-distance collaterals (<span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>; <span class="citation">Smith et al. (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
PCs from the lateral part send many projections onto their counterparts in the basal nuclei (B) <span class="citation">(Duvarci and Pare, 2014; Krettek and Price, 1978; Pitkänen et al., 1997)</span>, displaying preferential lateromedial directionality of those connections.
In addition, principal cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons (<span class="citation">Szinyei et al. (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
These synapses have peculiar characteristics, including no NMDA receptors <span class="citation">(Mahanty and Sah, 1998)</span> or AMPA receptors with low GluR2 subunit in the postsynaptic membrane <span class="citation">(Mahanty and Sah, 1998)</span>, resulting in strong inward rectification and calcium permeability <span class="citation">(Washburn et al., 1997)</span>.<!-- lepiej napisać functional relevance of these properties?????? --></p>
<p>BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their primary source of GABAergic inputs (<span class="citation">Bienvenu et al. (2012)</span>; <span class="citation">Muller et al. (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Rainnie et al. (2006)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff and Sah (2007b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
It is widely accepted that the anatomical location of the GABAergic synapses on the postsynaptic cell largely determines the functional impact of the interneuronal activity on the target neuron (for a review: <span class="citation">Tremblay et al. (2016)</span>).
Consistent with this notion, several microscopic analyses confirm that <!--in addition to their dendritic and somatic differences in morphology-->BLA interneuron subtypes display distinct somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies, including the specific subcellular domains targeted by their axons <span class="citation">(McDonald and Betette, 2001; Muller et al., 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003)</span>.
For example, principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA <!-- sprawdzić and  (Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Farb and Ledoux 1997, 1999) -->and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses.
Moreover, distinct subtypes of interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target of PCs.
Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; <span class="citation">McDonald and Betette (2001)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller et al. (2005)</span>, <span class="citation">Muller et al. (2006)</span>).
Moreover, PV-expressing neurons can be further grouped into chandelier cells that were demonstrated to primarily innervate the AIS of principal cells <span class="citation">(Bienvenu et al., 2012)</span> and basket cells, which form a continuum, varying proportions of perisomatic and distal dendritic synapses with principal neurons <span class="citation">(Veres et al., 2014)</span>.
Considering that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs’ spiking output and timing <span class="citation">(Woodruff et al., 2006)</span>.
On the other hand, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons (<span class="citation">Muller et al. (2007)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances.
Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials<!-- directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in -->, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: <span class="citation">Tremblay et al. (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Similar to excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines.
Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA.
However, the regulation of the BLA network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by <span class="citation">Prager et al. (2016)</span>.
Nonetheless, it should be briefly noted that neuromodulators and their receptors are distributed differently within different cell subtypes in the amygdala, inducing a broad range of electrophysiological effects, adding another level of complexity to the BLA network.
For example, DA selectively inhibited the GABA release from PV-immunopositive interneurons to principal cells, but not to other cell types, by acting <em>via</em> D2 receptors <span class="citation">(Chu et al., 2012)</span>.
This target-specific modulation results in the disinhibition of principal cells, whereas inhibitory inputs remain unaltered.
Moreover, at the network level, DA was revealed to reduce the inhibitory tone in the BLA, facilitating the induction of LTP at sensory afferents <span class="citation">(Bissière et al., 2003)</span> and the formation of fear memories <span class="citation">(Fadok et al., 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to their strong regulation of PCs’ activity, BLA interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron contacts.
Electron microscopy analyses revealed that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being mediated by gap junctions <span class="citation">(Muller et al., 2005)</span>.
While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among BLA interneurons remains high, but mainly within the same subtype <span class="citation">(Muller et al., 2005; Woodruff and Sah, 2007b)</span>.
This notion was further supported by a study using a conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical synapses (<span class="citation">Andrási et al. (2017)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).</p>
<p>Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors.
In general, activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-dependent, and slow, GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptor-dependent components <span class="citation">(Washburn and Moises, 1992)</span>.
Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory components originate from<!-- are due to activity of?--> distinct subpopulations of interneurons <span class="citation">(Sugita et al., 1992)</span>.
Furthermore, in contrast to most other cells, the slow component of the inhibitory synaptic potential in BLA pyramidal neurons is in part generated by a calcium-activated potassium conductance activated by calcium influx <em>via</em> NMDA receptors <span class="citation">(Danober and Pape, 1998; Lang and Paré, 1997)</span>.
These findings suggest that NMDA receptors might be coupled to calcium-activated potassium channels, at least in the lateral amygdala.</p>
<p>The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties <!-- expression of neuromodulators? -->contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations and flow of information.
These are often thought to be comprised of feedback inhibition <span class="citation">(Smith et al., 2000; Unal et al., 2014)</span>, feedforward inhibition <span class="citation">(Bazelot et al., 2015; Lang and Paré, 1997; Popescu and Paré, 2011)</span>, and disinhibition <span class="citation">(Bienvenu et al., 2015)</span> (for a comprehensive review: <span class="citation">Tremblay et al. (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Woodruff and Sah (2007a)</span>).
Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA.
Indeed, accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of the consolidation in the BLA <span class="citation">(Bauer et al., 2007; Klenowski et al., 2015; McDonald and Mascagni, 2004; Pelletier and Paré, 2004)</span>.
Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections, thereby modulating several behavioral responses <span class="citation">(Bauer et al., 2007; Bienvenu et al., 2012; Courtin et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017)</span>.</p>

(2002)</span>; <span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>).
Among many sensory inputs mentioned in the previous section (see: <a href="introduction.html#BLAinputs">1.2.2.2.1</a>, <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a), the prefrontal cortex (PFC, especially its medial part) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) have strong reciprocal connections with the BLA complex <span class="citation">(Sah et al., 2003)</span>.
In contrast, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the CeA.</p>
<p>Although a great majority of excitatory BLA projections<!--along with most of BLA interneurons form local synapses-->, there is a small fraction of long-range inhibitory interneurons, targeting the entorhinal cortex <span class="citation">(McDonald and Zaric, 2015)</span> or the basal forebrain <span class="citation">(McDonald et al., 2012)</span> as well as mPFC and periaqueductal grey (PAG) <span class="citation">(Sun et al., 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, multiple optogenetic experiments have identified<!--dissect?--> the functional role of BLA projections to cortical and striatal regions, translating BLA signals to behavioral output.
Specifically, it was shown that activation of both BLA→vHPC and BLA→mPFC projections increased anxiety and reduced social interactions, whereas their inhibition induced anxiolytic effects and facilitated social interactions <span class="citation">(Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016; Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013; Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014)</span>.
Moreover, optogenetic manipulation of BLA→CeA pathway was also shown to regulate anxiety in the same manner as BLA→vHPC and BLA→mPFC projections <span class="citation">(Tye et al., 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>The BLA complex is also a key part of neural circuits involved in the regulation of valence-related behavior.
Accumulating evidence suggests that divergent subpopulations of the BLA neurons differentially encode fearful or rewarding associations (for example: <span class="citation">Kyriazi et al. (2018)</span>).
Consistent with this notion, BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or CeA were reported to undergo opposing synaptic changes during conditioned appetitive and aversive emotional responses <span class="citation">(Namburi et al., 2015)</span>.
Specifically, BLA neurons projecting to NAc were reported to respond preferentially to reward-predictive cues <span class="citation">(Beyeler et al., 2016)</span>.
Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of those neurons was documented to facilitate reward-seeking behavior<!--and is mediated by intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signaling-->, whereas optical inhibition of the BLA terminals in NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose <span class="citation">(Namburi et al., 2015; Stuber et al., 2011)</span>.
Conversely, BLA neurons targeting the CeM were preferentially excited to a stimulus predicting an aversive outcome <span class="citation">(Beyeler et al., 2016)</span>.
Consistently, optical stimulation of BLA→CeM pathway increased fear conditioning and decreased reward learning, whereas photoinhibition of those neurons impaired fear conditioning and enhanced reward conditioning <span class="citation">(Namburi et al., 2015)</span>.
Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that valence could be decoded from the neural activity at the population level <span class="citation">(Kyriazi et al., 2018)</span>.
Thus, we are beginning to unravel how a single brain region can encode such opposite behaviors, which is of high relevance and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Notably, other critical components of amygdala fear circuits and BLA outputs are the intercalated cells (ITCs), GABAergic neurons surrounding the BLA.</p>

<div id="ITCs" class="section level3" number="1.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Intercalated cell masses</h3>
<p>Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the BLA.
Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into (1) lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITC<sub>L</sub>), bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITC<sub>MP</sub>, localized within the intermediate<!--internal?--> capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA,<!--medial paracapsular ITC cluster (Imp) --> and (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITC<sub>VM</sub>) (<span class="citation">Mańko et al. (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Millhouse (1986)</span>, <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).</p>
<p>Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (10–15 µm) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle <span class="citation">(McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Nitecka and Ben-Ari, 1987)</span>, and larger (&gt;50 µm) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices (<span class="citation">Bienvenu et al. (2015)</span>,<a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Moreover, ITCs express the highest density of µ-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala <span class="citation">(Jacobsen et al., 2006; Marowsky et al., 2005; Palomares-Castillo et al., 2012; Pape and Pare, 2010)</span>, indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems.
Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1α (mGluR1α), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors α1 subunit, and PV <span class="citation">(Bienvenu et al., 2015)</span>.
Electrophysiologically, both types of cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance, higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA interneurons. <span class="citation">(Busti et al., 2011; Geracitano et al., 2007; Mańko et al., 2011; Royer et al., 2000)</span>.
Their high intrinsic firing frequency could be explained by their expression of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) after an action potential, reflecting slowly-inactivating potassium currents (I<sub>SD</sub>) <span class="citation">(Royer et al., 2000)</span>. <!-- zmienić --></p>
<p>In addition, increasing evidence points to some functional diversity<!--heterogeneity--> within and between ITC clusters.
For example, neurons of the ITC<sub>MP</sub> cluster showed a stronger pattern of neuronal activation compared with other ITC clusters following<!--regarding--> fear-conditioning <span class="citation">(Hagihara et al., 2021; Hefner et al., 2008)</span>, whereas the activation of ITC<sub>VM</sub> neurons is more robust after extinction and extinction retrieval <span class="citation">(Busti et al., 2011; Hagihara et al., 2021; Likhtik et al., 2008)</span>.
Interestingly, dopamine, a crucial neuromodulator of neuronal activity within the amygdala complex, selectively hyperpolarizes and depresses the excitability of interneurons in ITC<sub>MP</sub> and ITC<sub>L</sub> clusters.
In contrast, other interneurons of the amygdala showed increased excitability after DA application, resulting in a disinhibition of the BLA and CeA nuclei <span class="citation">(Marowsky et al., 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>This functional heterogeneity between ITCs clusters may be in part dependent on their connectivity.
ITC<sub>L</sub> interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs <span class="citation">(Strobel et al., 2015)</span>, thereby providing feedforward inhibition to BLA principal neurons <span class="citation">(Marowsky et al., 2005)</span>.<!-- sprawdzić ostatnie cytowanie lITC neurons receive auditory input from cortical and thalamic regions. [@strobel_2015] ///-->
On the other hand, auditory input to ITC<sub>MP</sub> neurons is stronger from the thalamus and weaker from the cortex <span class="citation">(Strobel et al., 2015)</span>, and it was shown to undergo fear conditioning-related changes mediated by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors <span class="citation">(Asede et al., 2015)</span>.
ITC neurons receive projections from BLA and mainly target more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an inhibitory interface<!--gate--> between the BLA and CeA (<span class="citation">Busti et al. (2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Marowsky et al. (2005)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer et al. (2000)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
Interestingly, within this cluster, some neurons are mutually activated by BLA principal neurons and inhibited by other ITC cells <span class="citation">(Asede et al., 2015)</span>.
In addition, ITC<sub>PM</sub> neurons were suggested to directly inhibit the ITC<sub>VM</sub> cluster, resulting in disinhibition of the CeA and, thus, facilitation of fear responses <span class="citation">(Busti et al., 2011; Royer et al., 2000)</span>.
These findings illustrate that intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each cluster but also between clusters.
Hence, intercalated cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially by gating CeA output.</p>

<div id="CeAstructure" class="section level3" number="1.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Central amygdala</h3>
<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions <span class="citation">(Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998; McDonald, 1982b; Sah et al., 2003)</span>.
Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL <span class="citation">(Duvarci and Pare, 2014)</span>.
Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense intra-connectivity (<span class="citation">Krettek and Price (1978)</span> and for a review: <span class="citation">Fox et al. (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Gilpin et al. (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">Sah et al. (2003)</span>).
However, here we focus mainly on the CeA.</p>
<div id="neuronal-composition" class="section level4" number="1.2.4.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.1</span> Neuronal composition</h4>
<p>Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2016)</span>. <!-- nie wiem czy dobre cytowania-->
Neurons within this nucleus are a diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and <em>in vivo</em> patterns of activity.<!-- figure /// with different functional and molecular features. //  -->
Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons <span class="citation">(McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Sun and Cassell, 1993)</span>, further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA <span class="citation">(Medina et al., 2004; Waclaw et al., 2010)</span>.
More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (e.i., a small soma and numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low density of dendritic spines (<span class="citation">Cassell and Gray (1989)</span>; <span class="citation">McDonald (1982b)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalastr">1.5</a>).
Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles<!--response to current injections-->, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, mediated by K<sub>v1</sub>-dependent slowly inactivated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents <span class="citation">(Hou et al., 2016)</span>, and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive firing spikes <span class="citation">(Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004)</span>.
Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region.<!-- CeL or CeA in general? -->
The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells <span class="citation">(Martina et al., 1999)</span>. <!-- figure-->
Fast-spiking cells are characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency (&gt;40 Hz) with no accommodation <span class="citation">(Dumont et al., 2002)</span>, as their counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA.
Moreover, their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with &gt; 1 ms in other cell types in CeA <span class="citation">(Dumont et al., 2002)</span>. <!-- citations? -->
The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed with T-type calcium channels.
These channels are thought to contribute to characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to depolarizing current pulses, whereas those neurons generate rebound spikes when hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied <span class="citation">(Dumont et al., 2002; Hou et al., 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including SOM, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin (ENK), and others <span class="citation">(Cassell and Gray, 1989; Haubensak et al., 2010)</span>.
Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive.
Here, I will briefly describe the emerging subpopulations based on the expression of immunohistochemical markers, together with their electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections.</p>
<p>PKCδ-expressing neurons, which are mainly localized in the CeL and CeC subdivision of the CeA, form a relatively homogeneous group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (∼85%; <span class="citation">Haubensak et al. (2010)</span>).
The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons <span class="citation">(Haubensak et al., 2010)</span>.
Functionally, following fear-conditioning, these neurons display a reduced firing<!--+rate?--><!--activity--> and thus are often referred to as CeL<sub>OFF</sub> cells <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010)</span>.
Moreover, almost half of the PKCδ neurons co-express ENK or OR, which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM <span class="citation">(Haubensak et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2005; Viviani et al., 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKCδ marker express SOM <span class="citation">(Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013)</span>.
Those cells display heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining 40% are classified as LF <span class="citation">(Li et al., 2013)</span>.
Moreover, during fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear memory <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013)</span>.
Importantly, sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice <span class="citation">(Li et al., 2013)</span>.
Therefore, they have often been termed CeL<sub>ON</sub> neurons.
Despite one study demonstrating SOM- and CRF-containing neurons as two different neuronal populations mediating distinct behavioral outcomes <span class="citation">(Fadok et al., 2017)</span>, many other findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF <span class="citation">(McCullough et al., 2018; Pomrenze et al., 2015)</span>.
Accordingly, as PKCδ and CRF- or SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional roles.</p>
</div>
<div id="connectivity" class="section level4" number="1.2.4.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.2</span> Connectivity</h4>
<p>Although there was a prevailing notion that the CeA is a passive gateway conveying information from the BLA to downstream fear effectors, mounting evidence illustrates that this structure is an active participant not only in fear conditioning but also in distinct behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<div id="afferents" class="section level5" number="1.2.4.2.1">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.2.1</span> Afferents</h5>
<p>As mentioned previously, the BLA predominantly projects to the CeA (see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b and c).
In particular, while the lateral part of the BLA preferentially projects to CeL, CeM neurons receive more substantial inputs from the basal nucleus <span class="citation">(Duvarci and Pare, 2014; Krettek and Price, 1978)</span>.
The CeA can be innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto CeA neurons (<span class="citation">Krettek and Price (1978)</span>, <span class="citation">Lopez de Armentia and Sah (2004)</span> or indirectly <em>via</em> GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward inhibition (<span class="citation">Jüngling et al. (2008)</span>; <span class="citation">Royer et al. (1999)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
Considering excitatory inputs, besides typical AMPA and NMDA receptors<!--neurons in both the CeM and CeL receive glutamatergic inputs from the lateral and basal nucleus which activate both AMPA and NMDA receptors  [(Royer and M de A 2004)]].-->, presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors are present at excitatory inputs to CeL neurons <span class="citation">(Neugebauer et al., 2000)</span>, leading to the depression of the synaptic input.
This effect was reported to be modulated following kindling and chronic cocaine treatment <span class="citation">(Neugebauer et al., 2000)</span>.
Thus, it is possible that alterations in the synaptic efficacy at inputs targeting the CeA may be involved in the changes related to epilepsy or drug addiction.
Nevertheless, the best-documented role of those excitatory inputs is their involvement in fear learning and expression.
For example, fear conditioning was reported to strengthen the excitatory synapses from the BLA onto both SOM- and CRF-containing cells in the CeL <span class="citation">(Fadok et al., 2017; Li et al., 2013)</span>.
In line with these findings, the study conducted by <span class="citation">Tye et al. (2011)</span> nicely showed that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals<!-- or cell body --> in CeL reduced anxiety-related behavior in freely moving mice, whereas inhibition of these terminals was linked to a high-anxiety behavioral phenotype.
Importantly, this fear-related behavior was dependent on feedforward inhibition of the CeM <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010; Tye et al., 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intercalated cells, which were shown to also play a crucial role in fear-conditioning, form GABAergic synapses on CeL neurons (see Section <a href="introduction.html#ITCs">1.2.3</a> and Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
Notably, it was shown that the composition of GABA receptors in those synapses differs depending on their subcellular target <span class="citation">(Delaney and Sah, 2001)</span>.
Specifically, CeL soma receives synapses containing only GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas additional GABA<sub>C-like</sub> receptors, similar to bicuculline-insensitive retinal GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, have been demonstrated to be present at GABAergic synapses formed by intercalated cells onto dendrites of CeL neurons <span class="citation">(Delaney and Sah, 2001)</span>.
These results indicate that different compositions of GABA receptors may play distinct roles in the local circuitry of this region.</p>
<p>Additionally, not only inputs from the BLA and ITCs are involved in fear-conditioning.
CeL receives direct projections outside the amygdala, which are also crucial in this regard.
For instance, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a region activated by physical and psychological stressors<!-- stress sensor 1-3-->, was demonstrated to send projections to the CeL, preferentially innervating SOM-containing neurons (<span class="citation">Do-Monte et al. (2015)</span>; <span class="citation">Penzo et al. (2015)</span>, Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a).
Stimulation of those afferents resulted in the facilitation of the activity of SOM neurons, leading to the inhibition of CeL <span class="citation">(Do-Monte et al., 2015; Penzo et al., 2015)</span>, which is critical for fear-conditioning and expression <span class="citation">(Do-Monte et al., 2015; Penzo et al., 2015)</span>.
Similarly, oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus, another brain region innervating CeL, were illustrated to send their axon terminals onto CeL neurons (<span class="citation">Knobloch et al. (2012)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part a).
Activation of those projections led to the release of oxytocin onto CeL neurons, the increase in their excitability, and hence the attenuation of the freezing behavior <span class="citation">(Knobloch et al., 2012)</span>. <!--it leads to attenuation of freezing behavior ///  poprawić this is especially the case for.. -->
Yet another source of projections to the CeA, which are crucial for anxiety regulation, is the BNST, innervating stronger medial than lateral subdivision <span class="citation">(Gungor et al., 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, CeL, especially its PKCδ-expressing neurons, was revealed to be involved in feeding behavior.<!-- sending anorexigenic signals. // regulating -->
For example, stimulation of axons from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) directly projecting to CeL was reported to suppress the appetite <span class="citation">(Carter et al., 2013)</span>.
In line with this result, optogenetic excitation of PKCδ-containing neurons dramatically decreased feeding in both hungry and sated mice <span class="citation">(Cai et al., 2014)</span>.
Conversely, in mice, reducing the activity of PKCδ-immunopositive cells in CeL was shown to reverse the effects of decreased feeding induced by sickness or unpalatable tastes <span class="citation">(Cai et al., 2014)</span>. <!-- [@janak_2015] was found to block decreased feeding stimulated by sickness or unpalatable tastes-->
Hence, these findings indicate that CeL, especially the PKCδ subpopulation, is activated by anorexigenic signals.</p>
<p>The CeA also receives noxious stimulus information <em>via</em> processed input from the BLA and direct projections from the spino-parabrachial-amygdaloid pathway <span class="citation">(Braz et al., 2005)</span>.
In this regard, especially important seems capsular part of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeC), called “nociceptive amygdala,” due to its projections from the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB; a critical target of dorsal horn afferents; for example: <span class="citation">Dong et al. (2010)</span>), along with the well-demonstrated potentiation of synaptic transmission between those areas in many pain models (for example <span class="citation">Cheng et al. (2011)</span> or <span class="citation">Ikeda et al. (2007)</span>).</p>
<!-- We recently discovered that fear conditioning induces cell-type-specific plasticity in the CeL, with excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being strengthened and excitatory synapses onto SOMneurons being weakened (  Li et al., 2013  ).-->
</div>
<div id="intrinsic-connectivity" class="section level5" number="1.2.4.2.2">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.2.2</span> Intrinsic connectivity</h5>
<p>Over the last decade, the conjunction of optogenetics and electrophysiological approaches not only has further supported the prevailing notion that CeL neurons send mainly unidirectional afferents to CeM (<span class="citation">Haubensak et al. (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Jolkkonen and Pitkänen (1998)</span>; <span class="citation">Li et al. (2013)</span>; <span class="citation">Petrovich and Swanson (1997)</span>, Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b and c) but also has illustrated the complexity and extent of CeL intraconnectivity (i.e., within the network) and interconnectivity (i.e., between networks).
Generally, the CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features <span class="citation">(Cassell and Gray, 1989; Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004; Martina et al., 1999)</span>.
CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes (Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c). <!-- zmienić Although CeL neurons are mutually connected, they prefer to form synapses with the different class. -->
For example, synapses formed between LF→RS and RS→LF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class <span class="citation">(Hou et al., 2016)</span>.
Similarly, CRF-expressing neurons provide inhibitory input to both SOM- and PKCδ-immunopositive neurons in the CeL <span class="citation">(Fadok et al., 2017; Pomrenze et al., 2015)</span>, whereas connections between the same subtype are less frequent <span class="citation">(Partridge et al., 2016)</span>.
In addition to its GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-dependent synaptic modulation, CRF was also shown to increase excitatory synaptic transmission <em>via</em> its receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2 <span class="citation">(Ji et al., 2013; Pomrenze et al., 2015; Silberman and Winder, 2013)</span>.<!--Moreover, a more recent study has documented that CRF-expressing neurons undergo plasticity following fear-conditioning and that CRF1-dependent mechanisms are critical for proper discrimination of threat-predictive cues (Sanford et  al., 2017).--></p>
<p>It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal activity of the CeL is required for the fear acquisition, whereas activity in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010)</span>.
Moreover, CeM activation alone is well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing <span class="citation">(LeDoux et al., 1988)</span>.
This effect can be mimicked by CeL inactivation, indicating that CeL neurons tonically inhibit CeM output <span class="citation">(Ciocchi et al., 2010; Gozzi et al., 2010)</span>.
Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PKCδ-expressing cells than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable projections to the CeM <span class="citation">(Li et al., 2013)</span>.
In contrast, the PKC-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons (<span class="citation">Haubensak et al. (2010)</span>; <span class="citation">Li et al. (2013)</span>, Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part c).
Hence, during the presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically inhibited by CeL<sub>ON</sub>, SOM-immunopositive neurons <span class="citation">(Gozzi et al., 2010)</span>, leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction of freezing.<!-- dobrze wytłumaczone w Penzo 2014  -->
However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced, PKCδ-expressing CeL projection neurons become active, inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output. <!-- Therefore, the balance between activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations results in two  /// Therefore, these two parallel CeA outputs have been shown to control behavioral output balanced between passive freezing (*via* CeM output to the brainstem) and active exploration (*via* CeL-mediated disinhibition of cortical neurons). -->
Therefore, the balance between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly impacts the behavioral output of this region.</p>
</div>
<div id="efferents" class="section level5" number="1.2.4.2.3">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.2.3</span> Efferents</h5>
<p>While there is a general acceptance that the CeM is the major output nucleus of the amygdala playing a pivotal role in mediating behavioral and physiologic responses to emotionally relevant events <em>via</em> its inhibitory projections to downstream targets, some data indicate that the CeL also sends GABAergic projections to behaviorally and physiologically relevant regions. <!-- These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to the CeL–CeM pathway, additional channels exist for CeL to participate in fear processing.-->
Accumulating studies have illustrated that distinct neuronal subpopulations in CeM project to different brainstem sites.
Specifically, CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), a region important for autonomic regulation, receive inputs from those CeL neurons, which lack oxytocin receptors, whereas CeL neurons expressing oxytocin receptors target CeM cells projecting to PAG <span class="citation">(Viviani et al., 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>PAG, together with PVT, are also implicated in mediating defensive behavior <span class="citation">(Penzo et al., 2014)</span>.
Accordingly, these regions were shown to be directly inhibited by another subpopulation of CeL neurons, SOM-immunopositive neurons <span class="citation">(Penzo et al., 2014)</span>.
Thus, these data further support that the CeL also sends long-range projections to innervate regions outside the amygdala complex.
Moreover, both CeM and CeL neurons, especially those expressing CRF, send substantial projections to the BNST, affecting fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing (<span class="citation">Asok et al. (2018)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
These subpopulations also send afferents to locus coeruleus (LC), and their activation was sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavior <span class="citation">(Paretkar and Dimitrov, 2018)</span>.
Additionally, CRF-expressing neurons were shown to project to the SN, the VTA, and the LH <span class="citation">(Pomrenze et al., 2015; Reyes et al., 2011; Tsumori et al., 2006)</span>, regions mediating brain reward function.
Furthermore, CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC, which stimulation was shown to modulate reward-related behaviors (<span class="citation">Seo et al. (2016)</span>, see Fig. <a href="introduction.html#fig:amygdalaconnect">1.6</a>, part b).
Similarly, CeL also contains populations of projections neurons, some of which control cortical activity <em>via</em> basal cholinergic neurons and shift fear responses from freezing behavior toward an active escape <span class="citation">(Gozzi et al., 2010)</span>.
Hence, besides strong neuromodulatory innervation of the whole amygdala, this region can also indirectly influence the excitability of neuromodulatory cell groups releasing Ach, NE, DA located in the basal forebrain and brainstem.</p>
<p>In addition to its well-known role in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the pain pathway.
Interestingly, activation of ENK-containing neurons in CeL and CeC resulted in an increased c-Fos expression in PAG and reduced anxiety-like behavior and analgesia in both uninjured mice and mice with neuropathic pain <span class="citation">(Paretkar and Dimitrov, 2019)</span>.
This evidence strongly suggests the role of ENK-expressing neurons in regulating both nociception and emotion.</p>
<p>Taken together, these combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enable to increase or decrease the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. <!-- bardziej zmienić -->
Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and origin. <!-- bardziej zmienić // ładne podsumowanie--></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Summary</h3>
<p>Taken together, each nucleus receives a unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions.
The complex pattern of connections along with the balance of activity between them represents a mosaic set of regulatory motifs that orchestrates a distributed neural parallel circuitries.
All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and homeostatic control.
Considering this diversity, it is not surprising that the disruption of the amygdala functioning is associated with many disorders, including alcoholism and other reward-related disorders<!-- citations -->, anxiety<!-- citations-->, PTSD<!-- citations -->, and stress-related disorders<!-- citations-->, autism<!--citations-->, obesity<!-- citations-->, epilepsy<!--citations-->, pain<!--citations-->, just to list a few. <!-- , just to list a few (LeDoux, 2000; Phelps et al., 2014) -->
Thus, the amygdala functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant sensory information about the external and internal environment into behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in homeostasis.
Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution <span class="citation">(Jarvis et al., 2005)</span>, better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Chemokines action in the amygdala</h2>
<p>Amygdala is strategically positioned to regulate homeostatic function, and thus, one may speculate that it would be involved in integrating signals from endocrine and immune systems. <!-- jakieś lepsze intro... As being strategically positioned to be a hub, amygdala together with playing homeostatic function, one may speculate that i że several evidence i wymienić od 1 2 3-->
It is supported by several lines of evidence. <!-- review how immune system sub the brain -->
First, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages CeA and, to a lesser extent, the BLA <span class="citation">(Engler et al., 2011; Frenois et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009)</span>.
Peripheral signal of immune activation is thought to be mediated either <em>via</em> activation of vagal afferent fibers projecting by proinflammatory cytokines and/or glucocorticoids to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and then to the amygdala, predominantly its central part (for a review: <span class="citation">Vitkovic et al. (2000)</span>; <span class="citation">Critchley and Harrison (2013)</span>).
Alternatively, this signal activates the HPA axis, which is also connected with the amygdala <span class="citation">(Di Iorio et al., 2017; Green et al., 2007; Herman et al., 2005)</span>.
Moreover, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: <span class="citation">Yang et al. (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Second, mounting evidence illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part.
These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders <span class="citation">(Girgenti et al., 2017; Tovote et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016)</span>, epilepsy <span class="citation">(Fabene et al., 2010; Roseti et al., 2013; Suleymanova, 2021; Tian et al., 2017)</span>, obesity <span class="citation">(Guillemot-Legris and Muccioli, 2017; Kawamura et al., 2021)</span>, pain <span class="citation">(Mélik Parsadaniantz et al., 2015; Old and Malcangio, 2012; Paretkar and Dimitrov, 2019; Yuan et al., 2020)</span>, drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; <span class="citation">Coller and Hutchinson (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Freeman et al. (2012)</span>, <span class="citation">Jacobsen et al. (2016)</span>; <span class="citation">Wang et al. (2012)</span>).
Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala.</p>
<p>Third, many recent studies demonstrating glial involvement in behavior, including the amygdala <span class="citation">(Althammer et al., 2020; Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017)</span>.
Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors.</p>
<p>Finally, several studies have indicated the relative abundance of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors within the amygdala complex, including the BLA and the CeA <span class="citation">(Nishiyori et al., 1998; Tarozzo et al., 2003)</span><!-- dodać CXCR4, CXCR7 CYTOWANIA-->, strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala.
Surprisingly, despite many similarities between the amygdala network and chemokine system dysfunctions, the electrophysiological role of chemokines in this structure is still unclear.<!--  --></p>

<!-- Abnormal functioning of the amygdala is observed in various psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD,  specific  phobias,  depression,  autism  spectrum  disorder and  antisocial  personality  disorder  (Baron-Cohen  et  al.,  2000; Ferri et al., 2017; Fonzo and Etkin, 2017; Garcia, 2017; Kolla et al., 2017; Henigsberg et al., 2019).-->
