<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> CX3CR1 activation reduces the excitability of principal neurons in the rat BLA</h3>
<p>First, the intrinsic firing properties of principal cells, the most numerous neurons in the BLA, were assessed through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, evoking action potentials in response to somatic current injection.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed that following CX3CL1 treatment, the action potential’s threshold was significantly more depolarized, as compared to baseline (from -35.68 ± 1.38 to -33.28 ± 1.12 mV, n = 8, N = 5, t = -2.96, df = 7, p = 0.021, paired t-test, see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b).
Hence, a higher current injection is needed to induce neuronal firing, suggesting that pyramidal-like neurons may be less excitable in the presence of CX3CL1.
As shown in Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>d1), the gain (slope) remained unchanged (baseline = 0.04 ± 0.006, CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.04 ± 0.006, see Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall1">7.1</a> and <a href="appendix.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfigall2">7.2</a> in the Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1membraneappendix">7.3.1.1</a>).</p>
<p>Similar effects were observed in higher dose (baseline = -36.72 ± 0.96 mV, CX3CL1(5nM) = -34.21 ± 1.12 mV, n = 14, N = 6, t = -5.08, df = 13, p = 0.0002, paired t-test, see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b).
The two approaches were used to confirm whether CX3CL1-induced reduction in excitability is dependent on the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1.
First, before recordings, a subset of slices was incubated with antibodies against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml).
Under such experimental conditions, the CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells’ excitability was not statistically significant; however, there still was a proportion of neurons responding with an increased action potential threshold (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b).
Notably, slices used in this study were 300μm thin, and the antibody penetration was limited to (∼ 50μm, <span class="citation">Fogarty <em>et al.</em> (2013)</span>).
To this end, another subset of experiments was performed using a pharmacological approach with AZD8797 to inhibit CX3CR1 <span class="citation">(Ridderstad Wollberg <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>, AZD8797 prevented the CX3CL1-induced decrease in principal cells’ excitability, manifested as an increased action potential threshold, and thereby additionally confirmed CX3CR1 mediation in the observed effect (t = -0.61, df = 5, p = 0.568, paired t-test, n = 6, N = 5).</p>
<p>Of note, AZD9787 did not affect this parameter when applied alone (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd">4.2</a>a, baseline in DMSO = -43.02 ± 1.4, AZD8797(10μM) = -44.18 ± 1.29 mV, n = 8, N = 8, t = 2.07, df = 7, p = 0.077, paired t-test).</p>
<p>Since it is well-known that the CX3CR1 receptor is mostly expressed on microglia, next, the possible involvement of this type of glial cells in mediating CX3CL1-induced reduction of PCs excitability was investigated.
For this reason, the slices were pretreated with 20μM minocycline, a tetracycline-like antibiotic known to inhibit microglial activation, before and during CX3CL1 application.
As presented in Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>, the inhibition of microglial activity also diminished the CX3CL1-triggered effect on the action potential threshold (t = -0.66, df = 13, p = 0.522, paired t-test).
In contrast, the minocycline applied alone increased the excitability of PCs (baseline = -41.79 ± 0.95, minocycline (20μM) = -43.97 ± 1.67 mV, n = 9, N = 5, t = 2.55, df = 8, p = 0.034, paired t-test, Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityadd">4.2</a>).
Thus, this finding highlights the potential importance of microglial functions in regulating the activity of neurons in the BLA.</p>
<p>Finally, since it is increasingly evident that a heterogeneous group of interneurons tightly controls the activity of principal cells in the BLA (see Introduction <a href="intro.html#BLA">1.2.1</a>), it was investigated whether blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors would eliminate this depressing effect on PCs’ firing by CX3CL1.
For this reason, recordings were made with the additional presence of the picrotoxin (100μM) and CGP52432 (10μM), respectively.
As expected, the CX3CL1 effect was fully abolished when the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were blocked (baseline = -39.47 ± 1.28, CX3CL1 (2nM) = -38.99 ± 2.22 mV, n = 9, N = 4, t = -0.32, df = 8, p = 0.754, paired t-test, Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>b).
Thus, these data suggest that CX3CL1 reduced principal cells’ firing <em>via</em> a CX3CR1-, microglia-, and interneuron-dependent manner.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Excitatory synaptic transmission is not significantly changed after the CX3CL1 application</h3>
<p>Having established a significant CX3CL1-modulated suppression of principal cells’ firing, the main group of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA, the potential contribution of CX3CL1 on the modulation of the excitatory transmission in this area was measured.
Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded <em>via</em> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (held at −70 mV).</p>
<p>All measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission before and after applying CX3CL1, AZD8797, and minocycline are described in detail in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1sEPSCappendix">7.3.1.2</a>, summarized in Table 7.2, and illustrated in Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSCfigall">7.3</a>.
Compared to the control, CX3CL1 in both measured concentrations (2nM and 5nM) had a negligible effect on the median value of the amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of sEPSCs.
However, although statistically not significant, a proportion of neurons (∼ 50%) reacted with a decreased frequency of excitatory synaptic currents (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC">4.3</a>a).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to upregulated excitability, minocycline alone also altered sEPSC kinetics by increasing both their rise time from 0.51 ± 0.05 ms to 0.56 ± 0.05 ms, n = 9, N = 5, t = -3.33, df = 8, p = 0.01, paired t-test) and
decay time from 8.23 ± 0.16 ms to 8.53 ± 0.23 ms, n = 9, N = 5, t = -2.71, df = 8, p = 0.027, paired t-test)(Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsEPSC">4.3</a>b1-b3).
Thus, these observations suggest that microglia may be one of the key contributors regulating excitatory drive in the BLA.<!-- Our findings overall highlight microglia and its receptor CX3CR1 as key contributors in regulation of social behavioral adaptation to chronic stress.--></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> CX3CL1 decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission</h3>
<p>These results revealed that the CX3CL1-induced downregulation of principal cells’ excitability was also associated with GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (see Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>).
This is in line with mounting evidence pointing to local interneurons as key regulators of the activity of pyramidal-like neurons (see Introduction <a href="intro.html#BLA">1.2.1</a>).
Hence, the possible influence of CX3CL1 on the inhibitory transmission onto BLA PCs was next explored in <em>in vitro</em> slices.
Cells were clamped at 0 mV to record sIPSCs.
The representative traces of sIPSCs in the absence (baseline) and presence of CX3CL1 (2nM and 5nM) are shown in Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>.
At 2nM, CX3CL1 was ineffective in changing any of the sIPSCs measured parameters (for details, see Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.3.1.3</a>), whereas higher concentration (5nM) of CX3CL1 robustly<!--markedly--> reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA by decreasing the median frequency from 5 ± 0.415 to 3.45 ± 0.627 Hz and the median amplitude from 24.03 ± 2.358 to 20.93 ± 1.979 pA, respectively, compared to the baseline.
Further analysis of IPSCs kinetics showed that the median rise times and decay times remained unchanged (from 1.16 ± 0.094 to 1.18 ± 0.055 ms and from 27.47 ± 0.508 to 27.9 ± 0.514 ms, respectively), as reported by data in Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSCappendixfig">7.4</a> in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.3.1.3</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to what was observed in experiments assessing PCs’ excitability, this drastic reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission followed by CX3CL1 treatment was eliminated by both AZD8797 and minocycline.
In particular, following CX3CL1(5nM) application, the presence of the CX3CR1 inhibitor and the blocker of microglial activity resulted in the 1.24 ±1.07% and 1.35 ±
0.96% of the baseline median frequency, respectively.
These findings indicate a functional involvement of CX3CR1 and microglia in the modulation of BLA GABAergic transmission (Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, to determine if a decrease in sIPSC frequency by CX3CL1 was due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, the TTX (500nM) was used to block neuronal firing.
The mIPSC amplitude, frequency, and kinetics were measured before and after the CX3CL1 treatment (clamped at 0 mV).
No changes in these parameters were found between baseline and CX3CL1-applied recordings (see Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAsIPSC">4.4</a>b and c, mIPSC frequency: t = -0.79, df = 6, p = 0.459, paired t-test, mIPSC amplitude: t = -0.75, df = 6, p = 0.484, paired t-test).
Hence, data presented here suggest that CX3CL1 reduces GABA release at the local BLA synapses, probably by depression of the spontaneous firing of local interneurons.
Moreover, this inhibition of GABAergic transmission by 5nM CX3CL1 was mediated by both CX3CR1 and microglia.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> CX3CL1 impairs the long-term potentiation in the BLA</h3>
<p><em>Extracellular recordings and analysis were done by Bartosz Bobula, PhD, from the Department of Physiology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences</em></p>
<p>Considering studies indicating CX3CL1 involvement in memory, along with presented here depression of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA, the next step was to gain insights into how CX3CL1 modulates the BLA network activity.
To this end, extracellular recordings were employed.
The amplitude of field potentials, short-term plasticity, and long-term potentiation were assessed.
At the beginning of each experiment, the I/O curves were determined, as shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>a.
No significant differences were evident between the input–output curves of FPs recorded from the control and CX3CL1-induced slices (F (3, 41) = 0.4, P=0.75, ANOVA).
It indicates that CX3CL1 did not modulate the baseline excitatory activity in the BLA under our experimental conditions.
The paired-pulse ratio, a form of short-term plasticity sensitive mainly to presynaptic changes <span class="citation">(Stuart &amp; Redman, 1991)</span>, was also investigated.</p>
<p>PPR, a measure of short-term synaptic plasticity, is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the second response to that of the first, which depends on the probability of vesicular release at the synapse.
This parameter also remained unaffected by CX3CL1 treatment (H= 3.930, p = 0.27, Kruskal-Wallis test; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>b).
Thus, the unaffected PPR suggests a similar release probability of glutamate and, therefore, a postsynaptic mechanism of CX3CL1 action.</p>
<p>Notably, upon application of Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), external capsule-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control slices, but not in the slices treated with CX3CL1, as revealed by a significant decrease measured by the comparison of average potentiation before and after LTP induction (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test; see Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLALTP">4.5</a>c).
However, the additional presence of AZD8797, CX3CR1 antagonist, did not fully abolish this effect (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test).
Together, these findings demonstrate an impairment of BLA synaptic plasticity to external capsule inputs after CX3CL1 treatment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are expressed in principal cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala</h3>
<p><em>The part regarding neuronal cultures was done by Izabela Figiel-Ożóg, PhD and Prof. Jakub Włodarczyk from Laboratory of Cell Biophysics, Nencki Institute, Warsaw.</em></p>
<p><em>Anna Solarz, Iwona Majcher-Maślanka, PhD, and Agnieszka Chocyk, PhD, from the Department of Pharmacology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, performed perfusions, NeuN and CX3CR1 co-localization immunostainings, as well as provided me with methodological guidance regarding immunohistochemistry.</em></p>
<p>Given that neuronal localization of CX3CR1 was reported in several regions <span class="citation">(Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Heinisch <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Ruchaya <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Sheridan <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>, the next step was to investigate whether neurons in the amygdala also express this receptor.
To this end, immunohistochemistry was used to examine the co-localization of CX3CR1 with neuronal markers: MAP2 in neuronal amygdala cultures and NeuN in amygdala brain slices.
In addition, as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) and is a critical marker of principal cells in the BLA <span class="citation">(McDonald <em>et al.</em>, 2002)</span>, the percent of co-localization with this marker of excitatory neurons was measured.</p>
<p>As illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:BLACX3CL1immunofig">4.6</a>, our neuronal cultures of the amygdala showed that the CX3CR1 receptor was expressed in neurons in this limbic structure.
This observation was also confirmed with another neuronal marker, NeuN, in brain slices.
Moreover, the CX3CR1 receptor was present in 15.96 ± 1.01% of CAMKIIα-positive cells in the BLA.</p>
<p>Hence, although all of the electrophysiological effects of the CX3CL1 were prevented by minocycline, the direct action of this chemokine on neurons is also plausible.
However, as shown in Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1BLAexcitabilityfrak">4.1</a>c1 and c2, 50% of neurons were responsive when 2nM CX3CL1 was applied, while 5nM CX3CL1 affected a larger fraction of neurons, reaching 65%.</p>

However, the basolateral and central complexes of the amygdala participate in different extended circuitries.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Modulation of intrinsic membrane properties of CeL neurons by CX3CL1 in a cell-type-specific manner</h3>
<p>The next step was to investigate whether reduced excitability of CX3CL1 in the BLA would affect the membrane properties of their main target, i.e., GABAergic cells in the CeL.
To this end, among others, electrophysiological features such as excitability, input resistance, membrane time constant, and resting membrane potential were measured (see: Methods <a href="methods.html#electroprotocols">3.2.2.1</a>).</p>
<p>In general, these experiments revealed that several membrane properties in the CeL neurons were significantly modified by CX3CL1 (see Figs. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>).
However, since CeL neurons demonstrate mainly two types of electrophysiological firing patterns, such as Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons (see: Introduction <a href="intro.html#CeA">1.2.3</a> and Fig. <a href="methods.html#fig:methodsBLACeAIVrep">3.4</a>b), these intrinsic parameters were further analyzed based on these neuronal subtypes.
Intriguingly, while LF cells remained unaffected (see Figs. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, right panels), most RS neurons were responsive to the CX3CL1 treatment, which was reflected by robust changes in their intrinsic properties (Figs. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a> and <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, middle panels).
Specifically, similar to what was observed in the BLA, bath application of CX3CL1 (2nM) produced a decrease in the number of action potentials evoked by a given current step, manifested as a decrease in the gain (baseline = 0.12 ± 0.018, CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.07 ± 0.015, W = 71, p = 0.013, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a>).
This effect was accompanied by a reduced input resistance (from 503.75 ± 81.861 MΩ to 389.33 ± 76.968 MΩ, W = 69, p = 0.021, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test)
and membrane time constant (from 28.5 ± 2.278 ms to 22.59 ± 2.23 ms, t = 3.18, df = 11, p = 0.009, paired t-test; Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeARmtau">4.8</a>, middle panel).
Moreover, resting membrane potentials of Regular-Spiking CeL neurons become more depolarized in response to bath-applied 2nM CX3CL1, being -56.25 ± 2.75 at baseline and reaching -51.6 ± 2.392, t = -2.28, df = 11, p = 0.043, paired t-test after CX3CL1 treatment (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAVmexc">4.7</a>a2).</p>
<p>AZD8797 alone did not significantly change any of those parameters (see Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:AZDCeAmembrappendix">7.6</a> in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1CeAmembrappendix">7.3.1.4</a>).

Specifically, treatment with 20μM minocycline lowered the threshold needed for inducing action potentials in both types of neurons (from -35.64 ± 1.472 mV to -39.46 ± 2.234 mV, t = 2.95, df = 6, p = 0.026, paired t-test in Late Firing neurons

However, minocycline-induced increased input resistance and cell capacitance was observed only in Late-Firing neurons (from 431 ± 48.359 to 524.86 ± 55.497, t = -2.88, df = 6, p = 0.028, paired t-test and
from 71.86 ± 4.642 to 63.57 ± 4.219, t = 2.95, df = 6, p = 0.026, paired t-test, respectively; Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAintrinsicmino">4.9</a> b and c).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Effects of CX3CL1 on synaptic transmission in the CeL</h3>
<p>As CX3CL1 reduced excitability of both the glutamatergic BLA as well as GABAergic CeL neurons, both the excitatory and inhibitory transmission were investigated.
Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, no substantial changes were observed in RS and LF neurons.
The detailed data is shown in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CX3CL1CeAsEPSC">7.3.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, CX3CL1 application led to a reduction in GABAregic synaptic transmission, manifested as decreased frequency of sIPSCs onto Late-Firing neurons from 1.66 ± 0.185 to 1.45 ± 0.186 Hz, n = 8, N = 6, t = 2.45, df = 7, p = 0.044, paired t-test, Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>a1).
This effect was abolished when CX3CR1 and microglial activity were blocked by AZD8797 and minocycline, respectively (t = 0.39, df = 5, p = 0.715, paired t-test and t = 0.17, df = 7, p = 0.868, paired t-test).
These observations suggest a functional involvement of CX3CR1 and minocycline in the modulation of CX3CL1-induced inhibition of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing cells.
To examine whether this effect was mediated by the spontaneous firing of neurons in the slice, the set of experiments were performed in the presence of TTX (see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>)<!--part?-->.
Although 60% of Late-Firing cells reacted with reduction in miniature inhibitory synaptic currents, the statistic did not reach the level of significance (baseline in TTX: 0.65 ± 0.134, TTX + CX3CL1(2nM): 0.55 ± 0.092, n = 7, N = 4, t = 1.2, df = 6, p = 0.277, paired t-test).
All details about statistics, number of cells, animals, as well as descriptive analysis are summarized in Table 7.6 in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CeACX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.3.1.6</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, no significant effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission onto CX3CL1-treated Regular-Spiking neurons was found, despite a trend toward increased frequency (baseline: 1.31 ± 0.258, CX3CL1(2nM): 1.58 ± 0.308, n = 10, N = 8, t = -1.29, df = 9, p = 0.23, paired t-test, Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfig">4.10</a>a1).
The kinetics of sIPSC and mIPSC remained unaffected, as shown in Fig.<a href="appendix.html#fig:CX3CL1CeAsIPSCfigappendix">7.8</a> in the Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CeACX3CL1sIPSCappendix">7.3.1.6</a>.</p>

<p>To study whether BLA network can be regulated by CXCL12, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from principal cells.
The intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic transmission were measured using analogous protocols as in the CX3CL1 study.
As assessed by gain and threshold current, no significant changes in basal excitability were found at both CXCL12 concentrations (2nM and 5nM) despite a trend toward increased excitability (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAintrinsic">4.11</a>a).
This was especially true for CXCL12 at 5nM concentration; however, a high level of variation is observed (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAintrinsic">4.11</a>b).
Further research will be required to independently replicate these findings and further investigate the mechanisms of this effect.
Moreover, other measured membrane intrinsic properties of principal cells were also unaffected by CXCL12 treatment, as shown in Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:CXCl12BLAexcitabilityfigall">7.9</a> in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#BLACXCL12membrappend">7.3.2.1</a>).</p>

<p>Similarly, to evaluate the potential contribution of the chemokine CXCL12 in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission, the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs were analyzed.
As shown in Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>, at 2nM, the reduction in the frequency of sEPSCs is observed in 3 out of 10 cells following exogenous CXCL12 treatment, whereas this chemokine increased the excitatory transmission onto 4 out of 10 neurons (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and b1).
When all these neurons are grouped together, there is no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs (t = -0.58, df = 9, p = 0.578, paired t-test).
Similarly, when CXCL12 at a concentration of 5nM was bath-applied, 30% of principal cells responded with decreased frequency of sEPSCs, while the glutamatergic synaptic transmission was increased onto 40% of neurons (Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and b2, t = 0.28, df = 6, p = 0.79, paired t-test).
These findings also need further replication and investigation of the potential mechanisms underlying opposite effects of CXCL12 on sEPSCs frequency.

<p>Finally, the ability of exogenous CXCL12 to mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission was also assessed.
Although none of the measured sIPSCs’ parameters reached statistical significance, there is a trend in the frequency.
As shown in Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsIPSCfreq">4.13</a>, at the concentration of 2nM, CXCL12 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto 41.67% of principal cells.
In contrast, at 5nM, 8 out of 15 neurons showed an increased frequency of sIPSCs.
In addition, sIPSCs’ rise time is trendily increased by both doses of CXCL12 (Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsIPSCfreq">4.13</a>b and d).
However, this multifaceted effect needs further replication and exploration.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Enhanced excitability of CeL neurons following CXCL12 treatment</h3>
<p>First, to investigate the potential involvement of CXCL12 in neuronal activity in the CeL, the intrinsic firing properties of CeL neurons were assessed through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, evoking action potentials in response to somatic current injections.
Data reported in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a> demonstrates that CXCL12, especially at a higher concentration (5nM), enhanced CeL neurons’ excitability, measured as threshold current required for the first action potential and gain(slope) as a function of injected current and frequency of firing.
As described earlier, two main electrophysiological types of CeL neurons are Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons.
Thus, further analysis revealed that although this CXCL12-induced increased firing can be observed in both types of cells (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a>, right panel), it is more prominent and statistically significant in Late-Firing neurons, with threshold current during baseline being -37.91 ± 1.955 mV and reaching -40.18 ± 2.095 mV after CXCL12(5nM) treatment, n = 10, N = 7, t = 4.06, df = 9, p = 0.003, paired t-test).
These effects were prevented, at least partially, by the selective CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 (baseline in AMD3100: -39.5 ± 2.137 mV, CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 -41.94 ± 2.09 mV, n = 8, N = 4, t = 1.59, df = 7, p = 0.155, paired t-test).
Of note, the application of AMD3100 alone led to an opposite trend (from -41.86 ± 3.017 mV to -46.2 ± 5.304 mV, n = 4, N = 4,t = 1.64, df = 3, p = 0.199, paired t-test, Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAexc">4.14</a>, right panel).
These findings suggest that CXCR4 may be involved in the regulation of firing of Late-Firing neurons and possibly its tonic activity in those cells.</p>
<p>Given that several studies documented the presence of CXCR4 in astrocytes <span class="citation">(Bezzi <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Bonavia <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Calì &amp; Bezzi, 2010)</span>, it was investigated whether the blockade of these glial cells by incubation in astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, would eliminate the observed CXCL12-mediated increase in Late-Firing neurons excitability.
This effect was not abolished by an astrocytic inactivation in an acute brain slice (0.91 ±1.41% of baseline,
t = -1.85, df = 2, p = 0.205, paired t-test), raising the possibility that CXCL12 might activate CXCR4 directly on Late-Firing neurons, enhancing the excitability of these neurons.
Notably, this observation is based on a limited number of neurons (n = 3, N = 3) and, therefore, this finding needs further replication.</p>
<p>In addition, despite CXCL12-induced enhancement in CeL neurons’ excitability, CXCL12 does not modulate any other membrane properties in those neurons, indicating a rather presynaptic mechanism.
Figures and detailed descriptions can be found in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CXCL12CeAmembr">7.3.2.4</a>.
Together, these findings illustrate that CXCL12 upregulated LF neurons’ excitability in the CeL in a CXCR4-dependent and probably astrocytic-independent manner.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Complex actions of CXCL12 on excitatory synaptic transmission</h3>
<p>As presented in this dissertation, enhancement of excitability of CeL cells, mainly Late-Firing neurons, triggered by CXCL12 was not accompanied by any other measured membrane parameters, such as the input resistance (see Fig. <a href="appendix.html#fig:CXCl12CeAmembrfigall1">7.12</a> in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CXCL12CeAmembr">7.3.2.4</a>).
Thus, it may be speculated that rather than the involvement of any channel, this effect is a result of upregulated glutamatergic activity onto CeL neurons.
To test this hypothesis, spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated.
When all CeL neurons are grouped into one category, no differences in the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs are observed between baseline and CXCL12 treatment (<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>, left panel).
CXCL12 also did not enhance the glutamatergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons (<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>, right panel).
Intriguingly, regarding excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Firing neurons, two opposing trends (decreased vs. increased frequency of sEPSCs) were revealed depending on the concentration of CXCL12 used (2nM vs. 5nM; see Fig. (<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSC">4.15</a>a2)).
However, none of these effects reached statistical significance.
Nevertheless, several reports indicated the opposing effects of CXCL12 on neuronal function depending on the concentration, and thereby this issue warrants further investigation.
Several mechanisms for these opposite effects are reviewed in <span class="citation">Guyon &amp; Nahon (2007)</span>.
A detailed summary of measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission, together with Figure <a href="appendix.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsEPSCappen">7.14</a> illustrating the amplitude and kinetics of sEPSCs after CXCL12 treatment can be found in Table 7.11 in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CXCL12CeAsEPSCappend">7.3.2.5</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> CXCL12 modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala</h3>
<p>Considering that CeL neurons are mostly GABAergic and highly interconnected (see Introduction <a href="intro.html#CeA">1.2.3</a>), CXCL12-triggered enhancement in their excitability may thereby impact the inhibitory synaptic transmission.
To test this hypothesis, the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sIPSCs were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings.
As expected, the application of CXCL12 on brain slices significantly changed the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission (Figs. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a> and <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCLF">4.17</a>).
Analysis, which divided cells into two subgroups based on their electrophysiological types, revealed that CXCL12 at the concentration of 5nM differentially regulated inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CeL.</p>
<p>Specifically, CXCL12 enhanced the GABAergic transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons, as manifested by increased frequency of sIPSCs from 0.52 ± 0.132 Hz to 0.66 ± 0.146 Hz (n = 9, N = 7, t = -2.73, df = 8, p = 0.026, paired t-test, Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>a1),
without any changes in the amplitude (baseline: 15.17 ± 1.467 pA, CXCL12(5nM): 13.7 ± 0.73 pA, t = -2.73, df = 8, p = 0.026, paired t-test Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>a2).
To confirm that the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, is responsible for modulation of GABAergic transmission in RS neurons, the CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, was employed.
As expected, AMD3100 eliminated the CXCL12-induced increase in the frequency of sIPSC, with 0.59 ± 0.119 Hz in baseline
and 0.52 ± 0.107 Hz after CXCL12 treatment (t = 1.13, df = 7, p = 0.296, paired t-test, n = 8, N = 5, Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b2).
Since CXCR4 is well-known to be functionally expressed on astrocytes, the possible involvement of astrocytes in mediating CXCL12-induced enhancement of GABAergic transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons was investigated.
For this reason, prior to CXCL12 treatment, the brain slices were pretreated with fluorocitrate, a toxin known to inhibit astrocytic metabolism.
As shown in Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b3, fluorocitrate prevented the CXCL12-triggered increase in the frequency of sIPSCs (0.77 ±0.75% of baseline,
t = 2.08, df = 6, p = 0.083, paired t-test, n = 7, N = 5).</p>
<p>To determine whether there was a direct effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic terminals, the mIPSCs were recorded.
In these experiments, TTX was used to block the action potentials.
Under these conditions, the modulation of GABAergic transmission by CXCL12 was partially abolished (mIPSC frequency during baseline: 0.44 ± 0.08 Hz vs. mIPSC frequency after CXCL12 treatment: 0.4 ± 0.112 Hz, t = 0.65, df = 5, p = 0.547, paired t-test, n = 6, N = 6, Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>b4).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that the CXCL12-triggered increase in the frequency of sIPSCs was mediated through the stimulation of CXCR4 and probably associated with the increase in spontaneous firing of interneurons, as this effect is eliminated by TTX.
However, the inhibition of astrocytes by fluorocitrate was also shown to eliminate the previously described effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic transmission in Regular-Spiking neurons (see <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCRS">4.16</a>).</p>

<p>In contrast, in Late-Firing neurons, CXCL12 significantly reduced the sIPSC amplitude from 14.45 ± 0.86 pA to 12.5 ± 0.611 pA (t = 3.19, df = 12, p = 0.008, paired t-test).
This chemokine also lowered the sIPSC frequency from 0.75 ± 0.161 Hz to 0.48 ± 0.076 Hz (n = 13, N = 11, W = 75, p = 0.04, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, Figs. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCLF">4.17</a>a3 and b3).
These effects were eliminated in the presence of AMD3100, a CXCR4 blocker (baseline amplitude in AMD3100: 13.06 ± 0.536 pA, amplitude after CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 13.21 ± 0.69 pA, t = -0.36, df = 12, p = 0.723, paired t-test,
and baseline frequency in AMD3100 0.52 ± 0.142 Hz vs. frequency after CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 0.59 ± 0.131 Hz, n = 13, N = 7, W = 41, p = 0.787, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test).
Moreover, the CXCL12-induced reduction in the both frequency and amplitude of sIPSC were also blocked by the astrocytic toxin, flurocitrate (baseline in flurocitrate: 15.15 ± 1.884 pA, CXCL12(5nM) in fluorocitrate: 14.2 ± 0.939 pA, t = 0.87, df = 3, p = 0.449, paired t-test,
and baseline frequency in fluorocitrate 15.15 ± 0.061 Hz, CXCL12(5nM) in fluorocitrate: 0.62 ± 0.08 Hz, n = 4, N = 3, t = 1.16, df = 3, p = 0.332, paired t-test).
Finally, to determine if decreased sIPSC frequency and amplitude by CXCL12 in Late-Firing cells were due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, TTX was used to block neuronal firing, and the mIPSC parameters were measured before and after the CXCL12 application.
CXCL12 was ineffective to modulate both the mIPSCs frequency (1.06 ±1.05% of baseline, t = -0.39, df = 6, p = 0.707, paired t-test)
and amplitude (1.06 ±1.6% of baseline, n = 7, N = 6, t = -1.35, df = 6, p = 0.225, paired t-test).</p>
<p>Of note, further analysis of the IPSC kinetic parameters showed that the median rise times and decay times of the sIPSCs and mIPSCs from both Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons were unchanged after CXCL12 treatment (Figure <a href="appendix.html#fig:CXCL12CeAsIPSCfigapp">7.15</a> in Appendix <a href="appendix.html#CXCL12CeAsIPSCappend">7.3.2.6</a>).</p>
<p>These findings collectively illustrate that the regulation of GABAergic transmission by CXCL12 is cell-specific and dependent on spontaneous neuronal activity and mediated <em>via</em> direct activation of CXCR4 and astrocytes.</p>
