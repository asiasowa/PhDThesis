They can be found in all brain cells - from brain-blood barrier endothelium, through all types of glia, to neurons and neural stem cells. Neuron-glia crosstalk is also suggested to be modulated by chemokines. It should be noted that glial cells not only express chemokine receptors but also can dynamically release them, thus influencing the activity of neurons or other brain cells. This orchestration of neuron-glia communication is believed to be essential in maintaining brain homeostasis. Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 have attracted much attention by demonstrating their role in such phenomena as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, as well as modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The relatively high expression of their receptors, i.e., CX3CR1 and CXCR4, in limbic brain structures supports the association between them and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety or depression. Consistently, the impairment of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and/or CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling led to behavioral of neurobiological consequences, such as impaired learning or anxiety. Despite this, mechanisms of chemokines in the regions involved in anxiety (such as the amygdala) remain largely unknown. It would provide critical insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying neuroimmunological interactions in the amygdala. The aim of this study was to dissect the underlying mechanisms and effects of activation of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 receptors on synaptic transmission and electrophysiological property of neurons in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) - the main input nucleus, and central (CeA) - the main output nucleus. To this end, by using a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) on neuronal properties as well as synaptic transmission were determined. Moreover, the involvement of microglia or astrocytes was measured by using minocycline or fluorocitrate, respectively. In order to confirm the neuronal expression of CX3CR1, immunohistochemical staining was used. In the BLA, CX3CL1 increased the threshold for spike generation, reducing the neuronal excitability of principal cells (PCs). This effect was accompanied by the impaired LTP at cortico-BLA synapses and attenuated GABAergic transmission manifested as a decreased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs). These effects were blocked in the presence of the CX3CR1 antagonists, AZD8797. The treatment of the inhibitor of microglial activity, minocycline, eliminated the CX3CL1-triggered effects. These results suggest that the CX3CR1 activation might modulate the memory and emotional processing via its involvement in the GABAergic transmission and the attenuation of the PCs firing and synaptic plasticity. In the CeA, CX3CL1 decreased the input resistance of Regular-Spiking neurons (RS), resulting in the attenuation of their spiking. The firing reduction of RS neurons consequently reduced the frequency of sIPSCs in Late-Firing cells (LF). Those effects were eliminated in the presence of the antagonist of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797, or minocycline, the inhibitor of microglial activity. Thus, the network activity in the CeA is suggested to be, at least in part, modulated by the CX3CR1 activation. The treatment of CXCL12 in the BLA triggered a nonsignificant increase in the PCs excitability and dual changes in the inhibitory synaptic transmission. These changes are in line with the CXCL12-induced increase in glutamatergic transmission observed by other group. CXCL12 enhanced firing in both types of CeA neurons. The application of this chemokine facilitated the sEPSCs frequency preferentially onto Regular-Spiking neurons. Those effects were eliminated in the presence of the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. The CXCR4 activation triggered an increased frequency of sIPSCs onto Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the amplitude of these events in Late-Firing neurons was reduced. Those effects were blocked in the presence of a CXCR4 receptor antagonist and by inhibition of astrocytic activity by fluorocitrate. Altogether, findings from this study highlight the neuromodulatory role of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 in both nuclei of the amygdala, which is a consequence of their regulation of local neuron-glial communication. Further investigation in this area will lead to a better understanding of neuroimmunological mechanisms in the amygdala and provide novel insights into neuro-immune mechanisms in the amygdala and yield new targets for developing treatments of amygdala-related disorders.

They were originally identified as key regulators of both the peripheral and central immune response, serving chemotactic function on immune cells in late 1980 (Yoshimura et al., 1987). However, a decade later, the first reports revealed the prominent expression of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) (Meucci et al., 1998). Why do cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in CNS express chemokines and chemokine receptors, and what is the neurophysiological relevance of chemokines in the CNS? The explanation is that they control neuroinflammation, for example, by driving leukocyte trafficking and activation into the CNS, facilitating the immune responses, targeting cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (Williams et al., 2014). However, chemokine expression in the CNS is not only related to pathological conditions. It is now clear that all types of brain cells synthesize distinct chemokines and might respond to chemokine stimulation via their cognate receptor expression, also under physiological conditions, suggesting their brain-specific functions. Indeed, mounting evidence illustrates that chemokine can act on cellular (e.g., inducing neuroprotective signaling pathways), synaptic (e.g., modulating synaptic transmission), network (e.g., regulating synaptic potentiation), and behavioral levels (e.g., impairing memory; for a comprehensive review: Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)). Moreover, the complex cellular patterns of chemokine/chemokine receptor expression lead to intricate cell-to-cell communications. Thus, of particular interest is now the idea that CNS chemokines are not only mediators of neuroinflammation but also orchestrators of neuron-glia crosstalk, which is essential in maintaining brain homeostasis (Trettel et al., 2020). This PhD dissertation will mainly focus on two chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, together with their corresponding receptors, CX3CR1 and CXCR4, as they are widely distributed in the CNS under non-inflammatory, physiological conditions and involved in an increasing array of functions, such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavior (Réaux-Le Goazigo et al., 2013; Trettel et al., 2020; Sowa &amp; Tokarski, 2021). 1.1.2 Classification, structure, and signaling of the chemokine system Chemokines are small proteins consisting of 60 to 100 amino acids with 20 to 90% homology in their sequences. Their molecular weight varies from 8 to 14 kDa. To date, 53 human chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been cloned or characterized (Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018). All chemokine family members share a similar tertiary structure: a flexible N-terminus and N-terminal loop, followed by a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet on which a C-terminal -helix is folded (for review: Miller &amp; Mayo (2017)). Although N-terminus is widely acknowledged as pivotal for receptor activation, it is not sufficient in this regard. Notably, several additional regions of both chemokine and chemokine receptor were identified as critical for their binding and signal transduction, including N-loop, or highly conserved GP (glycine-proline) motif (for review: Kleist et al. (2016)). Thus, these data illustrate that subtle structural changes in a chemokine or chemokine receptor domain may significantly alter the receptor activation, resulting in unique functional outcomes for chemokine-receptor pairs. Chemokines were initially named according to their function or from the cell type that produced them. However, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in 2000, based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues closest to the Nterminus. It consists of the subfamily designation (XC, CC, CXC, CX3C), followed by the letter L (denoting ligand), and the number according to when the gene was first isolated (Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie (2000), see Figure 1.1). Specifically, one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues in the CXC subclass (also known as , see Figure 1.1, part a). Chemokines containing the first two cysteine residues adjacent to each other are classified into the CC subclass (also known as , see Fig. 1.1, part b). C chemokines (also known as , see Figure 1.1, part c) are characterized by the presence of only two cysteine residues. The CX3C (also known as ) chemokine subfamily currently represents only a single member, CX3CL1 (also called fractalkine). It is characterized by the presence of three amino acids between the first two cysteine residues, as well as a transmembrane and mucin-like domain (see Figure 1.1, part d). Figure 1.1: Classification of chemokines and chemokine receptors. (a) Chemokines are classified into four distinct subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C according to the number and spacing of their cysteine residues in their N-terminus. Cys  cysteine residue, X  amino acid residue, disulfide bridges are shown as dotted lines. Receptors for the CXC family are shown in violet, whereas receptors for the CC family are depicted in blue. In addition, the receptor for the C family is presented in yellow and the receptor for the CX3R family is shown in red. (b) Atypical chemokine receptors, their initial names, ligand selectivity, and crosstalk with classical chemokine receptors. ACKR1 and ACKR2 bind a broad spectrum of chemokines, whereas ACKR3 and ACKR4 bind a more limited number of chemokines. Chemokines exert their biological effects through cell surface chemokine receptors (CKRs), which can be divided into two families: conventional chemokine receptors and atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). Conventional receptors belong to the classic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, consisting of seven transmembrane helices connected by several intra- and extracellular loops, N-terminal extracellular, and C-terminal intracellular domains. The N-terminal extracellular domain is considered essential for chemokine binding and receptor activation, while the C-terminal end is coupled to G-proteins and is vital for receptor signaling upon chemokine binding. Based on the subfamily of chemokine ligand they bind, CKRs are named following the same principle as the chemokines but replacing L with R, which denotes receptor (see: Figure 1.1). Most of these receptors belong to the CCR and CXCR classes, with 10 and 6 members, respectively, while there is only one CX3CR and one XCR (Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018). Chemokine receptors typically signal through canonical G protein pathways and couple either to the Gi subunit following inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity to reduce the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels or Gq that activates phospholipase C, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate with a subsequent increase in a protein kinase C (PKC) activity and transient elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. However, mounting evidence describes the involvement of other intracellular signaling cascades, including distinct G protein subtypes (G11 or G12/13), or alternative signaling targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)½, Janus kinases (JAKs), and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) (for reviews: Allen et al. (2007), Rostène, Guyon, et al. (2011)). ACKRs, a small subset of proteins with at least four representatives (Bachelerie et al., 2014; Salvi et al., 2017), structurally resemble conventional chemokine receptors: ACKR1 (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC)), ACKR2 (D6), ACKR3 (CXCR7), and ACKR4 (chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR)). They bind a wide variety of chemokine ligands, with up to 18 ligands for ACKR1, and signal predominantly through -arrestins (Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018). Due to their inability to activate typical G protein-signaling pathways and thereby induce chemotactic activity, they were initially thought to scavenge chemokine ligands or function as co-receptors and thus regulate inflammation or chemokine gradient formation (Nibbs &amp; Graham, 2013; Bachelerie et al., 2014; Bonecchi &amp; Graham, 2016). However, recent data cast a new light on the complexity of the ACKRs role as regulating components of chemokine networks in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological contexts (for review: Salvi et al. (2017)). Regarding the CNS, the knowledge about the role of ACKRs is started to accumulate. 1.1.2.1 Chemokine system expression and signaling As chemokines constitute one of the most tightly regulated systems, their signaling is modulated via a broad array of factors, which we are now beginning to appreciate (see for reviews: Eiger et al. (2021); Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018); Zweemer et al. (2014)). Figure 1.2 illustrates most of these mechanisms, focusing on CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 as well as CX3C1/CX3CR1 axes. These processes include redundancy, post-translational modifications, dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions, atypical chemokine receptors, dimerization, interactions with other proteins on the membrane surface, and biased signaling. Firstly, the regulation of chemokines and their receptors may be controlled by post-translational modifications (PTMs), the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, such as citrullination or cleavage by several proteases (Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018), see: Fig. 1.2, part a). These changes profoundly affect chemokine system activity, including chemokine activation/inactivation, the change in binding affinity, or even switching from a receptor agonist to an antagonist (Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018). Another essential aspect of chemokine-induced signaling is their rich repertoire of ligand-receptor relationships (for reviews: Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie (2000), Hughes &amp; Nibbs (2018), Fig. 1.2, part b). It is widely accepted that most chemokines may bind to several different receptors, whereas nearly all of CKRs may recognize various chemokine ligands. However, it becomes increasingly evident that the interactions between chemokines and CKRs are far more restricted, complex, and less redundant than previously thought, as further addressed in this section. Consequently, each chemokine/CKR pair interaction depends, for example, upon the simultaneous spatial and temporal expression of both molecules (Zweemer et al., 2014). Most CKRs, like many GPCRs, constitutively exist as dimers (heterodimers/homodimers) or oligomers, thereby modifying ligand binding properties or activating different signaling pathways (Salanga &amp; Handel, 2011). Heterodimers, as they are formed with other GPCRs families (e.g., with opioid receptors), underlie the synergistic or antagonistic activity of various chemokine pairs (Kleist et al., 2016). Moreover, increasing data shows that dimer formation is regulated by other factors, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs, polysaccharides present at the cell surface and within extracellular matrices, bind chemokines and thereby immobilize and accumulate them. It is an essential step for the chemokine function, as it regulates their local concentration and availability for their receptors. Considering GAGs cell-, tissue- and developmental-specific expression (Lortat-Jacob, 2009), along with their selective binding of certain chemokines, GAGs-chemokine interactions are regarded as yet another mechanism contributing to chemokines orchestration of cell-to-cell communication. Biased signaling, also known as functional selectivity, is another feature specific for GPCR receptors (Zweemer et al. (2014), Kleist et al. (2016), see: Fig 1.2, part d). Three types of biased signaling can be distinguished. Ligand bias occurs when specific chemokines, although binding to the same receptor, could preferentially activate one of the intracellular pathways, either G-protein or -arrestin, and their downstream elements, according to cell-specific differences. Another type of bias signaling, receptor bias, occurs when a specific receptor, which typically binds multiple chemokine ligands, preferentially couples to a particular chemokine. Finally, cellular or tissue bias occurs when the same chemokinereceptor pair leads to activation of distinct signaling cascades or cellular responses in different spatial contexts. This type of bias is a consequence of differential expression or function of receptor and transducer elements, including every element of the signal transduction cascade, from proximal effectors (e.g., G proteins and -arrestins), to all of the downstream signal transduction machinery (e.g., ERK½ or MAPK) in different cells and tissue during different developmental stages. Thus, the final cellular behavior of chemokine receptor activation highly depends on the ligand, the receptor, and the spatiotemporal context. In summary, CKRs are a subgroup of GPCRs that impacts many crucial functions, such as homeostasis, development, and immune regulation, to list a few. A signaling network underlying such a range of fundamental cellular processes must be finely modulated, and this is achieved, among others, by these multifaceted, highly interconnected, tightly regulated mechanisms enabling quick response to the dynamic microenvironment with possible myriad functionally diverse outcomes. Figure 1.2: Molecular mechanisms of the chemokine system in the CNS. (a) Post-translational modifications exemplified by CX3CL1 transmembrane form cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases into its soluble variant. (b) The chemokine family redundancy is exemplified by ACKR3, an atypical chemokine receptor, which binds two chemokines, CXCL11 and CXCL12. Besides the ACKR3 receptor, these two chemokines activate other chemokine receptors, namely CXCR3 and CXCR4, respectively. (c) Most chemokine receptors can form homo- and hetero-dimers. It is exemplified by the well-known CXCR4-ACKR3 complex. CXCR4 receptor is a classical chemokine receptor, which activates G alphaq/i signaling pathways, including PKC or (ERK)1/2. As an atypical receptor, ACKR3 alone activates beta-arrestin-mediated pathways, leading to receptor internalization or scavenging. However, after heterodimerization with CXCR4, it can modify ligand binding properties and receptor signaling as well as intracellular trafficking. (d) Chemokine bias signaling occurs when specific chemokines could preferentially activate different intracellular pathways, either G-protein or beta-arrestin, although binding to the same receptor. It can be due to a specific ligand or receptor, as exemplified here, due to a specific cell. As suggested recently, when ACKR3 is activated on neurons, it signals through beta-arrestin-mediated pathways. Still, when it is activated on astrocytes, it recruits beta-arrestin-mediated pathways. The two members of the chemokine family, i.e., CX3CL1 and CXCL12, have attracted much researchers attention due to their wide distribution in the CNS under physiological conditions and involvement in an increasing array of functions. In addition to their broad expression in the periphery, which is beyond the scope of this dissertation, chemokines and CKRs are also expressed by healthy neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells (for a comprehensive review, see: Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)). 1.1.2.2 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair structure, expression, and signaling CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine or neurotactin, is a unique chemokine on many levels. First of all, to date, it is the only known member of the CX3C chemokine  family (Pan et al., 1997). In humans, the full length of CX3CL1 consists of 397 amino acids, whereas in mice, 395 amino acids (Bazan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997). Thus, it is also larger than most other chemokines, whose most common size is around 7080 amino acids (Zlotnik &amp; Yoshie, 2012). CX3CL1 is comprised of an extracellular 76-amino acid N-terminal domain, a 241-amino acid glycosylated mucin-like stalk, an 18-amino acid transmembrane helix, and a short acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Like CXCL16, fractalkine is present in two different forms: a membrane-anchored form tethered to cell membranes by a mucin-line stalk (approximately 95 kDa) and a shorter soluble form released upon proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal chemokine domain (approximately 70 kDa) via the action of several proteases (Bajetto et al. (2001); Schulte et al. (2007), see Section 1.1.2.1). These enzymes are metalloproteinases (enzymes containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) such as ADAM10, ADAM17, or cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS), acting both in the periphery and the CNS (Garton et al., 2001; Hundhausen et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2007; Cook et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2013). While soluble CX3CL1 acts as a conventional chemokine, promoting migration and chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells, mostly monocytes, membrane-bound CX3CL1 actions are similar to those of an adhesion molecule, mediating leukocyte capture and infiltration (Ransohoff, 2009). Some important molecular pathways implicated in CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are summarized on Fig. 1.3. Both forms of CX3CL1 interact with the same affinity with CX3CR1, a Gi-protein-coupled receptor (Imai et al., 1997). The subunit Gi inhibits the production of cAMP, inducing a variety of intracellular second messengers, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NFB) (Al-Aoukaty et al., 1998; Chandrasekar et al., 2003). These molecules are known to regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including apoptosis, proliferation, and transcription. Figure 1.3: CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling. CX3CR1, which is G protein-coupled and transduces several well-characterized signaling pathways leading to activation of transcription factors, including NFkB and CREB. Gi, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled to Gi protein; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases; Ras/Raf small GTPases; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; Akt, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEKK, MAP3 kinase; p38, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; IkB, an inhibitor of kappa B; IKK, an inhibitor of kB kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NFkB, nuclear factor kB; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein. In the brain, CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, are widely distributed in the CNS, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus (Harrison et al., 1998; Tarozzo et al., 2003). Besides the well-documented neuronal expression of CX3CL1, a handful of studies also revealed its presence in astrocytes, albeit at lower levels (for instance: Sunnemark et al. (2005)). However, the expression pattern of CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1, in the CNS, remains controversial: some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 microglia (Tarozzo et al., 2003; Cardona et al., 2006), whereas several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons (Meucci et al., 1998, 2000; Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Hatori et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2002; Tarozzo et al., 2003; Verge et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya et al., 2012, 2014). Thus, although predominantly expressed by microglia, CX3CR1 is also documented to be present on neuronal membranes, at least in pathological conditions. 1.1.2.3 CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 trio structure, expression, and signaling On the other hand, CXCL12, also known as the stromal cell-derived factor 1, is another chemokine yet belonging to the CXC subfamily. In humans, CXCL12 precursor mRNA precursor yields the expression of six isoforms (, , , , , ), ranging in size from 10 to 16 kDa (Yu et al., 2006). The  product of alternative splicing is the smallest and most abundant one (Yu et al., 2006). Hence, as used here, the term CXCL12 refers to the  isoform, which is the main focus of the presented PhD dissertation. It consists of 89 amino acids, including a signaling peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature protein. However, other isoforms are also likely to play a key role in physiologic and pathological processes (for a review: Britton et al. (2021)). CXCL12 is comprised of a three-stranded -sheet held in close apposition to an -helix, which are essential for CXCR4 activation (Murphy et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010). CXCL12 signal through its canonical CXCR4 receptor and atypical ACKR3 receptor, previously known as CXCR7. All three molecules are well-conserved across the vertebrate species (Nomiyama et al., 2013; Nomiyama &amp; Yoshie, 2015). Surprisingly, the binding affinity between CXCL12 and ACKR3 is roughly ten times higher than those between CXCL12 and CXCR4 (Balabanian et al., 2005). CXCL12, along with their receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, is constitutively expressed and widely distributed in the CNS, both during neurodevelopment and adulthood (Banisadr et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Schönemeier et al., 2008). Moreover, these molecules are present in nearly all CNS cell types, including endothelial, glial, and notably neuronal cells. Specifically, both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-localized with many neuropeptides, for example, in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA)(Guyon et al., 2006). Furthermore, ACKR3 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in the same neuronal (Shimizu et al., 2011) and astrocytic populations (Odemis et al., 2010). In neurons, prominent cytoplasmic expression of ACKR3 was demonstrated, whereas CXCR4 was found on the cell membrane (Shimizu et al., 2011), suggesting that ACKR3 may affect CXCR4 trafficking and/or coupling to other proteins (Shimizu et al., 2011). Consistently, ACKR3 up-regulation was shown to enhance heterodimer formation with CXCR4, which further resulted in its internalization and degeneration (Uto-Konomi et al., 2013). Moreover, as described in detail in Section Biased signaling (see Section: 1.1.2.1), there is a possibility that CXCL12 might trigger different ACKR3- or CXCR4- signaling in certain cellular contexts, which could lead to either G protein-dependent or -independent biased response. Following CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, in addition to the enhancement of receptor-ligand binding, there is a subsequent GDP exchange for GTP, and the trimeric Gi-protein dissociates into its constituent parts, Gi and G (Ganju et al. (1998); see Fig. 1.4). These molecules activate several intracellular signaling cascades, specifically phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C (PLC), and integrins (for a review: Britton et al. (2021), Ward (2006)). PLC hydrolyses phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 production leads to increased intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Both intracellular free calcium and PKC promote the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, leading to cell migration, growth, and proliferation. In parallel, the i subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase and a consequent cAMP production and activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in cell cycle entry and proliferation (Cheng et al., 2015). In addition to the well-characterized coupling to Gi, convincing evidence illustrates that CXCR4 can also bind to other G proteins such as Gq, Go, and Gs (for a comprehensive review: Pozzobon et al. (2016); see Fig. 1.4). For example, by binding to G12/13, CXCR4 leads to Rho activation, whereas Gq signal through Rac activation. Moreover, it is well documented that CXCR4 can trigger a G-protein-independent signal pathway. Following CXCR4 activation, G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are also activated, inducing the intracellular C-terminal domain phosphorylation, which, in turn, results in -arrestins recruitment. These molecules lead to the uncoupling of CXCR4 from G protein and subsequent receptor internalization. Moreover, -arrestins were reported to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CXCR4, leading to receptor downregulation and trafficking to endosomal compartments (DeNies et al., 2019). CXCL12 second receptor, ACKR3, like other ACKR receptors, contains a modified typical DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLAIV), a highly conserved region within the second loop of GPCRs (Thelen &amp; Thelen, 2008). The modification of this motif is believed to disable the activation of G proteins and subsequent Ca2+-induced chemotaxis (Burns et al., 2006; Levoye et al., 2009; Rajagopal et al., 2010). Thus, for a long time, as a member of the atypical chemokine receptor family, ACKR3 was thought to share some peculiar characteristics, such as the inability to induce canonical G protein signaling in response to ligand stimulation, which leads to a decrease in the extracellular chemokine concentration (Naumann et al., 2010). However, it was later discovered that despite being a decoy receptor, ACKR3 could also signal via the -arrestin pathway (Rajagopal et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011). Moreover, although the same ligand activates CXCR4 and ACKR3, they signal through different pathways (-arrestin vs. G-coupled). Thus, relative to CXCR4, ACKR3 acts as a -arrestin biased receptor (see Section 1.1.2.1). Nonetheless, more recently, it was shown that ACKR3 has functionality independent of the -arrestins. Specifically, Montpas et al. (2018) demonstrated that both small interfering RNA knockdown of -arrestin1 and or -arrestin2 in HEK293 cells do not affect ACKR3-mediated scavenging of either of ACKR3s ligands (i.e., CXCL11 and CXCL12). In addition, the following studies further complicate this issue by illustrating that application of CXCL12 results in elevated astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ levels following the activation of Pertussis Toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins, leading to proliferation or differentiation of astrocytes (Odemis et al., 2010). Although these events were previously reported to be mediated by CXCR4 (for example: Bajetto et al. (2001)), a recent report has challenged this view by demonstrating that these CXCL12-dependent outcomes persist when CXCR4 receptor is blocked or depleted from astrocytes but are prevented in astrocytes with depleted or blocked ACKR3 receptor (Odemis et al., 2012). These findings suggest that ACKR3 activates classical G-protein signaling pathways in those cells. Hence, it is likely that ACKR3 functions as a ligand-biased receptor in astrocytes, as CXCL11, another ACKR3 agonist (Burns et al., 2006), resulted in activation of -arrestin2 signaling in the same experimental setting (Odemis et al., 2012). Therefore, it is speculated that depending on the cell type, ACKR3 acts either as an atypical, arrestin-coupled scavenger chemokine receptor or as a classical, G protein-activating GPCR. However, due to contradictory results from previous studies, this issue warrants further clarification. Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that following CXCL12 treatment, ACKR3 impairs astrocytic gap-junctional communication by inducing a Connexin-43 (Cx43) internalization in a -arrestin2-dependent manner (Fumagalli et al., 2020). In contrast, CXCR4 leads to NF- activation with consequent Tumour Necrosis Factor  (TNF-) and glutamate release from these cells (Bezzi et al., 2001; Calì et al., 2008; Calì &amp; Bezzi, 2010). Therefore, these data suggest that CXCR4 and ACKR3 may serve distinct functions via different signaling pathways in astrocytes, indicating that, in particular cellular contexts, ACKR3 might trigger G protein-dependent or -independent signaling (Heuninck et al., 2019).

Accordingly, the neuroanatomical distributions of several chemokines and their corresponding receptors, including the described above CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes, overlap in many regions in the healthy CNS, suggesting their involvement in local communication, especially crosstalk between neurons and glia. Recently, in the light of the glial revolution, our long-held views of the functions of these cells have been completely challenged. Astrocytes, previously considered supporting and nourishing neurons, are now known as the highly heterogeneous group of active players in complex brain functions, such as synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, network oscillations, and behavior (Perea et al., 2009; Mederos &amp; Perea, 2019). Being organized into microdomains and coupled into multicellular astrocytic networks via gap junctions, they are highly specialized cells (for a review: Khakh &amp; Sofroniew (2015)). Furthermore, astrocytes tightly enwrap neuronal cell bodies, axons, dendrites, and synapses. For example, it is estimated that a single cortical astrocyte makes contact from 20,000 to 120,000 synapses in rodents and up to 2,000,000 synapses in humans (Oberheim et al., 2009), suggesting bidirectional communication. Indeed, they are endowed with a great variety of ion channels and receptors (Olsen et al., 2015; Seifert et al., 2018; Kofuji &amp; Araque, 2021) to react to a changing microenvironment, while they can release a substantial set of gliotransmitters (Araque et al., 2014; Covelo &amp; Araque, 2018; Savtchouk &amp; Volterra, 2018). Ca2+ levels are particularly relevant in astrocyte signaling, as their elevated Ca2+ levels are thought to induce gliotransmission and facilitate synaptic transmission. Thus, astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ elevations are of specific spatial and temporal properties, and this topic has been extensively discussed in several excellent reviews (Araque et al., 2014; Bazargani &amp; Attwell, 2016; Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017). Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, constituting about 512% of total CNS cells in the healthy brain and the spinal cord (Szepesi et al., 2018). They are derived from the myeloid precursor cells and colonize the immature brain during early embryonic development (for a review, see: Prinz &amp; Mildner (2011)). These glial cells are also broadly distributed throughout the CNS, albeit their density and functions may differ based on spices and specific brain regions (for a review, see: Szepesi et al. (2018)). Although microglia have long been recognized as guardians of the brain, regulating inflammatory responses in the CNS, it is becoming increasingly evident that their functions are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain during both development and adulthood. Being equipped by highly motile processes, microglia are dynamic and plastic cells that constantly monitor the microenvironment to sense local perturbation. Moreover, similar to astrocytes, microglia also express numerous cell surface ion channels and receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, as well as signaling molecules. Hence, both astrocytes and microglia are emerging as highly dynamic and heterogeneous cells. Notably, those rich repertoires of expressed surface and signaling molecules include a set of chemokines and their receptors. Thus, glial cells can both react to and release chemokines (for example: Dorf et al. (2000), McKimmie &amp; Graham (2010); Sowa et al. (2017)). Given constant glial monitoring of brain parenchyma, these immune molecules might orchestrate neuron-glia actions, linking the influence of the environment to brain function, from cellular to synaptic, network, and finally behavioral levels. The first discoveries regarding CX3CL1 and CXCL12 non-inflammatory roles were studies showing their influence on the reduction of neurotoxicity, mainly by activating neuroprotective pathways, such as Akt phosphorylation or activation of MAP kinases (p-38, ERK½) (Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Meucci et al., 2000). Specifically, CXCL12 (Meucci et al., 1998) and then CX3CL1 (Meucci et al., 2000) were reported to reduce the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons induced by gp120 or glia deprivation. Later, more studies further documented that both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are neuroprotective against glutamate-induced and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cultures from either rodents or humans (Deiva et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Nicolai et al., 2010). Moreover, the binding of CX3CL1 to microglial CX3CR1 was shown to restrain LPS-induced microglia activation (Mizuno et al. (2003); Zujovic et al. (2000), for a review: Biber et al. (2007)), leading to the initial presumption that CX3CL1 maintains microglia in a resting or off state. However, further studies illustrated that microglia activation is not an all or none event, but rather a continuum of progressive stages depending on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cues in the local environment, which, in turn, change their phenotype and functional activity (Crain et al. (2013); Lively &amp; Schlichter (2013); for a review: Masuda et al. (2020) and Tan et al. (2020)). Nevertheless, following the CX3CL1 application, microglia was reported to release soluble factors that promote neuroprotection, including adenosine (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). It is an endogenous modulator of brain functions, binding to its GPCR presynaptic receptor subtypes (adenosine A1 receptor, adenosine A2A receptor, adenosine A2C receptor, and adenosine A3 receptor - A1R, A2AR, A2C, and A3R, respectively). It was shown that adenosine modulates CX3CL1 neuroprotection via A1R (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010). This receptor, expressed on microglia, was also reported to be required for CX3CL1 increase in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) activity in astrocytes, resulting in higher glutamate removal from the extracellular space, and thereby neuroprotective action (Catalano et al., 2013). Thus, these data nicely illustrate the CX3CL1-regulated local communication between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to neuroprotection. The next milestone in neuroimmunology was observations that CX3CL1 and CXCL12 with their corresponding receptors exhibit the highest expression during neurodevelopment, indicating their crucial functions during this period. Indeed, it has become increasingly evident that both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axes are crucial players in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival in this period. For instance, during hippocampal development, CX3CR1-/- deficient microglia showed impaired migration (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Pagani et al., 2015). This observation was associated with their delayed synaptic pruning, reflected as a transient reduction of synaptic density and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating immature synaptic properties (Paolicelli et al., 2011). Precisely, these changes were observed during the early postnatal stage (P8-P28) and then returned to baseline. Importantly, these mice were also tested in similar experimental settings in their adulthood (P40) (Zhan et al., 2014). Although dendritic spine density remained unchanged, neurons from CX3CR1-/- mice still displayed a lower frequency of miniature and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and sEPSCs, respectively) than their wild-type littermates, illustrating that a transient reduction in microglial synaptic pruning during development is sufficient to induce the long-term deficit in synaptic transmission despite unchanged the number of excitatory synapses (Zhan et al., 2014). On the other hand, those neurodevelopmental processes regulated by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 (i.e., proliferation, migration, and survival) are also present in the adult brain. Accordingly, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are associated not only with developmental neurogenesis (Tran et al., 2004; Pujol et al., 2005; Lysko et al., 2011), but also adult neurogenesis, which is restricted to two neurogenic regions, i.e., the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) near the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. For example, both CXCR4 and CX3CR1 receptors are expressed on neural stem cells (Ji et al., 2004). In addition, it is well established that CXCL12 is responsible for the generation and positioning of new neurons within these niches, as well as their axonal and dendritic outgrowth and branching (Abe et al., 2015, 2018; Zhu et al., 2017). Moreover, similar to what was observed during the neurodevelopment, in CX3CR1-/- knockout mice, adult-born granule neurons in the DG also displayed a reduced number of dendritic spines with additionally observed morphological changes, such as enlargement and shortening (Bolós et al., 2018). Besides being ultrastructurally enlarged, synapses at both afferent and efferent levels were depleted of synaptic vesicles, suggesting impaired functionality. Given their previously mentioned inhibition of both glutamate and N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated neurotoxicity, together with their influence on neuronal processes outgrowth, branching, and synaptic pruning, one could speculate that CXCL12 and CX3CL1 could modulate electrophysiological properties in the CNS. Indeed, accumulating data reveals that these chemokines modulate neuronal electrical activity through both postsynaptic (e.g., changes in Ca2+ transients or intrinsic membrane properties by activation/inactivation of particular channels/receptors following CKRs activation) and presynaptic (i.e., including presence in synaptic vesicle and (co-)release of neuropeptides/neurotransmitters/gliotransmitters) mechanisms (for a review: Rostène et al. (2007) and Sowa &amp; Tokarski (2021)). For example, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2008). Importantly, further investigations revealed that CX3CL1 might not exclusively act on postsynaptic neurons but also activated microglia, which in turn, released adenosine (Piccinin et al., 2010). Similarly, one of the adenosinergic receptors, the A2AR, together with D-serine release from glial cells, is also required for CX3CL1 regulation of NMDA receptor function (Scianni et al., 2013). Moreover, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 impact adult neurogenesis along with synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, which are believed to affect synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. Accordingly, both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 axes were reported to be upregulated following learning (Rogers et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012). In addition, several lines of evidence illustrated that CX3CL1 modulates synaptic plasticity in this region (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2009, 2011; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011) and regulates learning and memory (Maggi et al., 2011; Rogers et al., 2011; Serchov et al., 2015; Reshef et al., 2017). Chemokines regulation of synaptic plasticity is not restricted to the hippocampus. Briefly, both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 molecules were shown to affect synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum (Giovannelli et al., 1998; Ragozzino et al., 2002), and mice with CX3CR1-/- receptor deletion were characterized by the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the spinal cord (Bian et al., 2015). These findings may be associated with CX3CL1-mediated behavioral consequences regarding motor coordination and pain (Verge et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2011). It also should be noted that another form of synaptic plasticity, i.e., synaptic scaling, is widely accepted to be mediated by TNF (Bezzi et al., 2001), which is mainly expressed by astrocytes, for example, via CXCR4 activation (Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006). Therefore, by modulating TNF levels, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, by acting on glia, may participate in homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity (Stellwagen &amp; Malenka, 2006). In addition, mounting evidence shows interactions between the chemokine system and classical neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. For instance, CXCL12 was shown to increase glutamate and GABA release in the SN, the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, and the DRN (Ragozzino et al., 1998; Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005; Guyon et al., 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010). By acting on the presynaptic site, CXCL12 affects the activity of serotoninergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA), and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons, thereby modulating the release of neuroactive molecules (Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005; Guyon et al., 2006; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010). Moreover, CXCL12 is packed in small dense vesicles in the nerve terminals of these neurons, which are then released from neuronal cell bodies and terminal nerve endings in a calcium-dependent manner (for example: Bhattacharyya et al. (2008)). However, as CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 are often co-localized with neurons releasing these signaling molecules (e.g., vasopressin, MCH, and DA), postsynaptic mechanisms are also suggested to be involved in this phenomenon. For example, in MCH neurons, CXCR4 was described to directly modulate several voltage-dependent channels, including Na+ and K+ channels of the action potential (Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005), or tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents (Guyon, Rovère, et al., 2005). These results suggest that CXCL12 signaling may be involved in neuroendocrine functions, including water/food intake, metabolism, and stress. In line with this notion, CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 signaling dysfunctions are associated with feeding disorders, such as anorexia. Not only a high-fat diet was reported to increase the expression of CXCL12, its receptors, and neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalin, galanin, orexin, and MCH) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH), but also an intracerebroventricular injection of CXCL12 was shown to mimic the effects of the high-fat diet in the hypothalamus (Poon et al., 2016). These findings point to a vital role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in feeding behavior. Similarly, the dopaminergic neurons in the SN are also the target of both pre- and postsynaptic actions of CXCL12. CXCL12 was reported to enhance the frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) in this region, indicating presynaptic mechanisms, which is in line with the documented presence of CXCR4 on the GABAergic neurons (Guyon et al., 2006). In addition, it was demonstrated that CXCL12 could act directly as a neuromodulator of dopaminergic neuronal electrical activity through the modulation of high voltage activated calcium currents (Guyon et al., 2008). Consistent with this data, by using unilateral intranigral or intracerebroventricular injections of CXCL12, a further study has illustrated that this chemokine triggered contralateral turns in circling behavior (Skrzydelski et al., 2007). Of note, considering that both CXCL12 and CXCR4 are co-expressed in dopamine neurons, this chemokine is speculated to act in an autocrine manner (Guyon et al., 2008). Importantly, some CXCL12-induced increase in an inward current is suggested to be induced from glutamate release from astrocytes (Guyon et al., 2006). Finally, over the last decade, the notion that dysfunctions in the chemokine system lead to neuropsychiatric diseases has attracted much attention (for a review Stuart et al. (2015)). Broadly, dysfunctions in the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pairs are similar to sickness behavior. It is a physiological and psychological state characterized by decreased mood, anorexia, and fatigue, due to immune activation during infection, primarily mediated by peripherally released proinflammatory cytokines (Dantzer, 2001; Dantzer &amp; Kelley, 2007). Given the described above, modulation of the release of serotonin in the DRN as well as involvement in feeding behavior and learning by CX3CL1 and CXCL12 may affect mood and lead to depression (Maes et al., 1998). Accordingly, the link between those chemokines and chronic stress is well-documented (Zhan et al., 2014; Sowa et al., 2017; Piirainen et al., 2021). Interestingly, initial behavioral evidence is starting to elucidate the possible mediation of those chemokines in anxiety-related behavior (Yang et al., 2016; Bolós et al., 2018; Schubert et al., 2018). Those types of behavior are widely accepted to be due to dysfunctions in the functioning of the amygdala. Consistently, this region was reported to display relatively high expression of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 (Nishiyori et al., 1998; Tarozzo et al., 2003), strongly suggesting functional roles of these receptors in the amygdala. Moreover, findings from many animal and human studies indicate that peripheral activation of the immune system engages the amygdala (Frenois et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Engler et al., 2011). In addition, activation of the immune system by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reported to induce anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, as measured, for example, by elevated plus-maze test (EPM), a test assessing amygdala-mediated functions (for example: Yang et al. (2016)). Mounting evidence also illustrated many similarities between dysfunctions of amygdala function and chemokine signaling, pointing to the possibility that their mechanisms may overlap at least in part. These involve anxiety and stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders (Tovote et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Girgenti et al., 2017), epilepsy (Fabene et al., 2010; Roseti et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2017; Suleymanova, 2021), obesity (Guillemot-Legris &amp; Muccioli, 2017; Kawamura et al., 2021), pain (Old &amp; Malcangio, 2012; Mélik Parsadaniantz et al., 2015; Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019; Yuan et al., 2020), drug dependence (mainly alcohol and opioid; Coller &amp; Hutchinson (2012), Freeman et al. (2012), Jacobsen et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2012)). Despite those similarities, still little is known about immune modulation in the amygdala. Finally, recent studies demonstrated glial mediation in behavior, including in the amygdala (Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017; Althammer et al., 2020). Considering the crucial role of chemokines in glia signaling, these immunomodulators may, at least, partly contribute to those behaviors. Thus, given our evolving understanding of how CXCL12/CXCR4 or CXCL12/ACKR3 are involved in the control of intercellular communication between brain cells, as well as in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of their actions will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit. 1.2 Amygdala The amygdala is a brain structure located in the medial temporal lobe associated with a broad array of behaviors, such as learning, fear, anxiety, reward, and addiction (LeDoux, 2000; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Roozendaal et al., 2009; Herry et al., 2010). Surprisingly, despite this variety of functions, the amygdala is well-conserved throughout evolution. Even non-mammalian species such as reptiles, birds, and fishes have counterparts with similar circuits and functions to the amygdala in mammals (for a review: Janak &amp; Tye (2015)). It is speculated that this may be due to the adaptive context of those phenomena. In order to survive when confronted with particular events, animals must discriminate and learn specific environmental stimuli that predict potentially life-threatening or sustaining events so that they can mobilize adaptive responses to those stimuli in the future. For example, during fear conditioning, a neutral stimulus, such as an acoustic tone (i.e., the conditioned stimulus [CS]), that predicts an aversive outcome, for example, a footshock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus [US]), results in defensive responses, including freezing behavior (LeDoux, 2000; Janak &amp; Tye, 2015). Analogously, reward-induced conditioning responses lead to a cue-triggered behavior (Tye et al., 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen et al., 2010). Thus, both learning about danger and potential rewards are adaptive and engage the amygdala (Janak &amp; Tye, 2015). These distinct behaviors are believed to be reflected by widespread amygdalar connections with an array of other brain regions, from the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem (for reviews: Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014); Pape &amp; Pare (2010); Sah et al. (2003)) as well as is complex inner structure. This limbic region is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of nuclei, which can be distinguished based on their different connectivity, immunohistochemical and cytoarchitectural profiles (for a review, see: Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014)). Historically, amygdala nuclei are divided into three groups: (1) the deep or basolateral group, which includes the lateral nucleus, the basal nucleus, and accessory basal nucleus; (2) the superficial or cortical-like group, which includes the cortical nuclei and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract; and (3) the centromedial group composed of the medial and central nuclei, such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the anterior amygdala area (AAA), and the amygdalo-hippocampal area (AHA) (McDonald, 1998; Sah et al., 2003). Here, the following classification will be used: the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA), and intercalated cell (ITC) masses, based on many excellent papers (Bocchio et al. (2016); Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014); Ehrlich et al. (2009); Pape &amp; Pare (2010); Spampanato et al. (2011), see Fig. 1.5). Nuclei that do not fall into any of these categories are beyond the scope of this dissertation and are described elsewhere (Pitkänen et al., 1997; Sah et al., 2003). Figure 1.5: Physiological and morphological properties of amygdalar neurons BMA, basomedial nucleus; B, basal nucleus; LA, lateral nucleus; CeL, lateral subdivision of the central nucleus; CeM, medial subdivision of the central nucleus; ITC, intercalated cell. Recent technological advances, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, in conjunction with a battery of behavioral tests and electrophysiology, have been dissecting how genetically targeted cellular activity within the amygdala could contribute to each of these distinct processes (for example, Lalumiere (2014)). Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge of the amygdalas role, anatomy, and physiology. The physiological and morphological properties of neurons in relation to specific nuclei are shown in Fig. 1.5, whereas simplified illustrations of their main inputs, outputs, and intra-connectivity are depicted in Fig. 1.6. 1.2.1 The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) The basolateral complex is anatomically divided into the lateral nucleus (LA), the basal nucleus (B), and the basomedial nucleus (BMA), the latter also known as the accessory basal nucleus (Krettek &amp; Price (1978), see Fig. 1.5). All these nuclei are often referred to as the basolateral nucleus (BLA), and hereafter this term will be used. The BLA is considered the main input nuclei of the amygdala (for reviews: Duvarci &amp; Pare (2014); Lalumiere (2014); Sah &amp; Lopez De Armentia (2003)). Briefly, multisensory and highly processed information derived from all modalities (e.g., olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory, visceral, auditory, and visual) converges in the BLA. It is carried by inputs from higher-order thalamic nuclei, sensory, associative cortices, and the hippocampus, entering the amygdala via the external or internal capsules (for reviews: Hájos (2021); Sah et al. (2003)). A large body of evidence highlights the role of these terminals in the acquisition of fear and appetitive conditioning, which is associated with synaptic potentiation in the BLA (Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux et al., 1990; Tye et al., 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen et al., 2010). In addition, this nucleus is strongly innervated by a wide array of neuromodulators (see Fig. 1.6, part a). Specifically, this region receives: (1) noradrenergic (NE; norepinephrine) innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), (2) serotonergic projections originating from the DRN, (3) dense dopaminergic innervation from the VTA and the SN, and (4) projections from the basal forebrain (Prager et al. (2016) and references therein). This amygdalar complex displays cortical-like characteristics based on its developmental origin and structural organization (Waclaw et al., 2010), although BLA neurons do not exhibit a laminar organization (Sah et al., 2003). Within the BLA, approximately 80% of all neurons are glutamatergic pyramidal-like principal cells, and the remaining 20% belong to a heterogeneous group of interneurons (McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Spampanato et al., 2011; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014). Accordingly, both principal cells (PCs) and interneurons show many morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to their cortical and hippocampal counterparts. Morphologically, PCs are characterized by a large triangle-shaped soma, spiny complex dendritic trees, and the presence of a thicker apical dendrite (McDonald (1982a), see Fig. 1.5). Considering electrophysiological properties, PCs show spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing somatic current injections (Faber et al. (2001); Paré et al. (1995), see Fig. 1.5). The degree of this adaptation forms a continuum: at one end, cells fire two to three spikes only and show marked spike frequency accommodation, whereas, at the other end, their firing is repetitive throughout the current injection with little accommodation (Funahashi et al., 2000; Faber et al., 2001). On the other hand, BLA interneurons are a highly heterogeneous subpopulation, forming functional classes based on a large array of parameters, which is a subject of many excellent reviews (Spampanato et al., 2011; Prager et al., 2016; Hájos, 2021). Analogous to their counterparts in the neocortex and hippocampus, interneurons in the BLA can be characterized by their calcium-binding protein and peptide contents, forming at least four distinct subpopulations: (1) parvalbumin+/calbindin+ (PV+/CB+) neurons (around 40% of BLA interneurons), (2) somatostatin+/calbindin+ (SOM+/CB+) neurons (about 17%), (3) large multipolar cholecystokinin+ (CCK+) neurons that are often calbindin+, constituting 7% of whole BLA interneuronal population, and (4) a family of small bipolar and bitufted interneurons expressing calretinin (CR), CCK, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), accounting for 35% of BLA interneurons (Kemppainen &amp; Pitkänen, 2000; McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; Muller et al., 2003). In contrast to principal cells, BLA interneurons show no apparent spike frequency adaptation in response to a prolonged depolarizing current injection, their action potentials have a shorter duration (half-width 0.7 ms), and they fire spontaneously in vivo at high frequencies (10-15 Hz) (Paré et al., 1995; Spampanato et al., 2011). Consistent with the notion that the BLA is a cortical-like structure, these firing properties resemble those found in cortical interneurons (Group et al., 2008) but not those of GABAergic neurons in the CeA (Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004). Among BLA interneurons, further electrophysiological analyses have identified a plethora of firing patterns (Spampanato et al., 2011). Some evidence has distinguished the difference among interneuronal subtypes, such as a generation of short-duration action potentials with no adaptation by PV-expressing cells (Rainnie et al. (2006); Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a), see Fig. 1.5), whereas CB-immunopositive neurons produce broad spikes with clear adaptation (Jasnow et al., 2009). However, the role of this electrophysiological heterogeneity is still unclear. Nevertheless, it is speculated that neurons with disparate electrophysiological properties have distinct afferent/efferent connections and modulate local circuits differently (for reviews: Spampanato et al. (2011), Tremblay et al. (2016)). Also, contrary to principal cells, interneurons have smaller cell bodies, and their axon collaterals are restricted to the BLA (McDonald &amp; Betette, 2001; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2002; McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004). Their dendritic trees could be subdivided into multipolar, bitufted, bipolar, and chandelier cells (McDonald (1982a); Woodruff et al. (2010), see Fig. 1.5). Moreover, although most BLA interneurons have aspiny dendrites, those protuberances of some interneurons show a more spine-sparse morphology (Klenowski et al., 2015). It should also be noted that BLA interneuron axons branch sparingly, forming dense terminals and collaterals with principal neurons.

Principal cells are densely interconnected between subdivisions of the BLA complex by sending long-distance collaterals (Sah et al. (2003); Smith et al. (2000), see Fig. 1.6, part c). PCs from the lateral part send many projections onto their counterparts in the basal nuclei (B) (Krettek &amp; Price, 1978; Pitkänen et al., 1997; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014), displaying preferential lateromedial directionality of those connections. In addition, principal cells also form more local synapses with surrounding interneurons (Szinyei et al. (2000), see Fig. 1.6, part c). BLA interneurons reciprocally innervate principal cells, providing their primary source of GABAergic inputs (Bienvenu et al. (2012); Muller et al. (2006); Rainnie et al. (2006); Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007b), see Fig. 1.6, part c). Principal neurons form complex dendritic arborizations, with distal dendrites receiving high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from outside and within the BLA (Brinley-Reed et al., 1995; Farb &amp; LeDoux, 1997; Farb &amp; Ledoux, 1999) and proximal dendrites and soma being densely covered with GABAergic synapses (Klenowski et al., 2015). However, further ultrastructural analyses revealed that distinct subtypes of interneurons also present minor differences in their subcellular target of PCs. Specifically, axonal arborizations of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons were shown to target perisomatic regions of principal cells, including their soma, proximal dendrites, and the axon initial segment (AIS; McDonald &amp; Betette (2001), Muller et al. (2005), Muller et al. (2006)). Given that the perisomatic region generates sodium-mediated action potentials, those strategically positioned inhibitory synapses are thought to strongly regulate PCs spiking output and timing (Woodruff et al., 2006). In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons predominantly target distal dendrites and spines of these pyramidal-like neurons (Muller et al. (2007), see Fig. 1.6, part c). Since these parts of dendrites are also a destination of extensive excitatory inputs, these GABAergic synapses influence how excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances. Therefore, inhibitory synapses from SOM-containing interneurons may influence such phenomena as a generation of calcium-dependent dendritic action potentials, dendritic integration, glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and back-propagation of action potentials from somata to dendrites (for a comprehensive review, see: Tremblay et al. (2016)). Like excitatory input, monoaminergic projections form synapses in the BLA, primarily with distal dendritic shafts and spines. Thus, all these complex connectivity patterns are additionally submerged in a rich cocktail of neuromodulators, influencing the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory cell types within the BLA. The regulation of the BLA network by neuromodulatory systems is comprehensively reviewed by Prager et al. (2016), as it is beyond the topic of this dissertation. In addition to their strong regulation of PCs activity, BLA interneurons form local networks consisting of a high number of interneuron-interneuron contacts. Electron microscopy analyses revealed that those connections are both chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being mediated by gap junctions (Muller et al., 2005). While pyramidal cells do not show electrical coupling in mature animals, the electrical connection probability among BLA interneurons remains high, but mainly within the same subtype (Muller et al., 2005; Woodruff &amp; Sah, 2007b). This notion was further supported by a study using a conjunction of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy, which distinguished two parallel networks of PV- or CCK-containing interneurons, each coupled by chemical and electrical synapses (Andrási et al. (2017), see Fig. 1.6, part c). Moreover, BLA interneuronal subpopulations differ in efficacy, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic inputs and outputs due to, for example, different subunit compositions of GABA receptors. In general, activation of interneurons in the BLA generates inhibitory synaptic potentials with fast, GABAA-receptor-dependent, and slow, GABAB-receptor-dependent components (Washburn &amp; Moises, 1992a). Electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that these inhibitory components originate from distinct subpopulations of interneurons (Sugita et al., 1992). The abovementioned differences in subcellular targeting domain, connectivity, synaptic kinetics, and intrinsic membrane properties contribute to a highly specific and precise spatiotemporal inhibitory control, leading to tremendous consequences on cellular and network computations and flow of information. These are often thought to be comprised of feedback inhibition (Smith et al., 2000; Unal et al., 2014), feedforward inhibition (Lang &amp; Paré, 1997; Popescu &amp; Paré, 2011; Bazelot et al., 2015), and disinhibition (Bienvenu et al., 2015) (for a comprehensive review: Tremblay et al. (2016); Woodruff &amp; Sah (2007a)). Moreover, activation of the GABAergic system is regarded as critical for synchronizing spiking activity within BLA. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicated that synchronized oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies in local ensembles of projection neurons have emerged as a key element of emotional learning in the BLA (McDonald &amp; Mascagni, 2004; Pelletier &amp; Paré, 2004; Bauer et al., 2007; Klenowski et al., 2015). Furthermore, these oscillatory activities can coordinate and enhance the effects of input signals and BLA projections, thereby modulating several behavioral responses (Bauer et al., 2007; Bienvenu et al., 2012; Courtin et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017). It should also be noted that despite being the main input of the amygdaloid complex, the BLA sends a few projections. Despite its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus, predominantly unidirectional outputs of the BLA include the nucleus accumbens (NA), indicated as crucial in reward-seeking behavior (Stuber et al., 2011; Namburi et al., 2015; Beyeler et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the BLA predominantly projects to the extended amygdala (see Section 1.2.3), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the CeA (see Fig. 1.6, parts b and c). Those connections are associated with anxiety and social interactions (Tye et al., 2011; Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013; Felix-Ortiz &amp; Tye, 2014; Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016). Notably, the CeA can be innervated by BLA principal cells either directly by forming glutamatergic synapses onto CeA neurons (Krettek &amp; Price (1978), Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah (2004) or indirectly via GABAergic ITCs neurons, leading to feedforward inhibition (Jüngling et al. (2008); Royer et al. (1999), see Fig. 1.6, part b). 1.2.2 Intercalated cell masses Intercalated cells (ITCs), a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons, do not form a compact nucleus but rather gather in numerous small densely packed clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the BLA. Based on their location, the ITC clusters are often divided into (1) lateral intercalated cell cluster (ITCL), bordering on the lateral part of the BLA within the external capsule (2) the medial paracapsular intercalated cluster ITCMP, localized within the intermediate capsule, which separates the BLA from the CeA, and (3) the biggest cluster among ITCs, located ventro-medially to the BLA (ITCVM) (Mako et al. (2011); Millhouse (1986), 1.5). Within each cluster, at least two types of neurons can be distinguished: interneurons with small (1015 µm) ovoid cell bodies and spiny, flattened, long, dendritic trees restrained within the fiber bundle (Nitecka &amp; Ben-Ari, 1987; McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993), and larger (&gt;50 µm) interneurons with long, thick, aspiny dendrites and highly branched, long-range axonal projections, innervating neurons in the BLA or areas outside the amygdala, such as the perirhinal, entorhinal, and endopiriform cortices (Bienvenu et al. (2015),1.5). Moreover, ITCs express the highest density of µ-opioid and dopamine type-1 receptor (D1) in the whole amygdala (Marowsky et al., 2005; Jacobsen et al., 2006; Pape &amp; Pare, 2010; Palomares-Castillo et al., 2012), indicating the possible modulation of amygdala activity by opioid and dopaminergic systems. Larger interneurons additionally show strong expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 (mGluR1), GABAA receptors 1 subunit, and PV (Bienvenu et al., 2015). Electrophysiologically, both types of cells share similar features, including lower membrane capacitance, higher membrane resistance, and firing frequency than BLA and CeA interneurons (Royer et al., 2000; Geracitano et al., 2007; Busti et al., 2011; Mako et al., 2011). Moreover, intercalated neurons are interconnected not only within each cluster but also between clusters. For example, ITCL interneurons receive convergent auditory cortical and thalamic inputs (Strobel et al., 2015), thereby providing feedforward inhibition to BLA principal neurons (Marowsky et al., 2005). On the other hand, the BLA mainly targets more ventrally located ITCs and the CeA, forming an inhibitory interface between the BLA and CeA (Busti et al. (2011); Marowsky et al. (2005); Royer et al. (2000), see Fig. 1.6, part b). Hence, intercalated cell clusters are parts of feedforward, feedback, and disinhibiting inhibitory circuits and modulate amygdala-related behaviors, especially by gating CeA output. 1.2.3 The central amygdala The central amygdala (CeA) is a GABAergic nucleus comprised of capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), medial (CeM), and intermediate (CeI) divisions (McDonald, 1982b; Jolkkonen &amp; Pitkänen, 1998; Sah et al., 2003). Importantly, the CeL and CeC are often considered together as CeL (Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014). Of note, in some papers, CeA, together with the BNST and nucleus accumbens shell, is also considered to be a part of the extended amygdala due to their similar neuronal phenotypes and inter-connectivity patterns with other brain regions, along with their dense intra-connectivity (Krettek &amp; Price (1978) and for a review: Fox et al. (2015), Gilpin et al. (2015), Sah et al. (2003)). However, here we focus mainly on the CeA. Contrary to the BLA, CeA is considered the main output nucleus (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2016). However, similar to the BLA, there are also exceptions from this oversimplified model, and both CeM and CeL receive direct projections outside the amygdala (see Fig. 1.6, part a)). Among others, neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT, Do-Monte et al. (2015), Penzo et al. (2015)), the BNST (Gungor et al., 2015), parabrachial nucleus (PBN; Carter et al. (2013)) or oxytocinergic neurons from the hypothalamus (Knobloch et al., 2012) sends projections to this region, influencing diverse set of behaviors. Neurons within this nucleus are a diverse group of GABAergic interneurons, forming functional subclasses based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features, as well as connectivity and in vivo patterns of activity. Morphologically, they are reminiscent of striatal medium spiny neurons (McDonald &amp; Augustine, 1993; Sun &amp; Cassell, 1993), further supporting the notion of different developmental origins of the BLA and the CeA (Medina et al., 2004; Waclaw et al., 2010). More precisely, CeL neurons mainly have similar medium spiny neuron-like morphology (i.e., a small soma and numerous branches with a high density of dendritic spines), whereas CeM neurons have a large soma and dendrites with few branches and a low density of dendritic spines (Cassell &amp; Gray (1989); McDonald (1982b), see Fig. 1.5). Based on neuronal electrophysiological firing profiles, two major types have been described in the CeA: (1) late-firing neurons (LF), with a pronounced delay before the onset of the first action potential (100-200 ms) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections (Hou et al., 2016), and (2) regular-spiking neurons (RS), generating repetitive firing spikes (Dumont et al., 2002; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004). Both of these types account for nearly 90% of all neurons in this region. The remaining types do not exceed more than 10% of the whole CeA neuronal population and are classified as (3) fast-spiking cells and (4) low-threshold bursting cells (Martina et al., 1999). The latter is characterized by a high input resistance and action potential frequency (&gt;40 Hz) with no accommodation (Dumont et al., 2002), as their counterparts in the cortex, the hippocampus, or the BLA. Moreover, their action potentials are significantly briefer with a half-width of around 0.6 ms compared with &gt; 1 ms in other cell types in CeA (Dumont et al., 2002). The fourth, low-threshold bursting neuron type, is endowed with T-type calcium channels, which are thought to contribute to characteristic spike bursts or spike doublets generation in response to depolarizing current pulses as well as rebound spikes when hyperpolarizing current pulses are applied (Dumont et al., 2002; Hou et al., 2016). Neuronal cells in CeA also express a wide selection of neuropeptides and markers, including SOM, protein kinase C (PKC), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), oxytocin receptors (OR), enkephalin (ENK), and others (Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Haubensak et al., 2010). Although there are some links between peptidergic phenotypes in CeA and electrophysiological and behavioral outputs, the peptidergic subpopulations in CeA are not entirely mutually exclusive. Generally, the CeL microcircuit contains diverse GABAergic neuronal subpopulations with different functional and molecular features (Cassell &amp; Gray, 1989; Martina et al., 1999; Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah, 2004; Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). PKC-expressing neurons form a relatively homogeneous group, comprised mainly of late-firing cells (85%; Haubensak et al. (2010)). The remaining small fraction was identified as RS neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010). Functionally, following fear-conditioning, these neurons display a reduced firing and thus are often referred to as CeLOFF cells (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010). Moreover, almost half of the PKC neurons co-express ENK or OR, which has been linked to the inhibitory gating of CeM (Huber et al., 2005; Haubensak et al., 2010; Viviani et al., 2011). On the contrary, most cells absent of the PKC marker express SOM (Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013). Those cells display heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, where about 60% of all SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to the RS type, while the remaining 40% are classified as LF (Li et al., 2013). Moreover, during fear-conditioning, SOM-containing neurons respond with an increase in their activity, whereas their selective inhibition markedly impairs fear memory (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). Importantly, sole activation of those neurons is sufficient to induce freezing in control freely moving mice (Li et al., 2013). Therefore, they have often been termed CeLON neurons. Many findings documented that, in CeL, approximately half of SOM-expressing neurons are also immunoreactive for CRF (Pomrenze et al., 2015; McCullough et al., 2018). Accordingly, as PKC and CRF- or SOM-immunopositive neurons belong to non-overlapping neuronal populations, it is plausible that they fulfill different functional roles. CeL neurons are mutually connected; however, they prefer to form synapses with the different electrophysiological and/or neurochemical subtypes (Fig. 1.6, part c). For example, synapses formed between LFRS and RSLF neurons were reported to have greater density and efficacy than those between cells of the same class (Hou et al., 2016). It is widely accepted that following fear conditioning, neuronal activity of the CeL is required for fear acquisition, whereas activity in the CeM is required for the expression of conditioned fear responses (Ciocchi et al., 2010). Moreover, CeM activation alone is well-documented to be sufficient to induce unconditioned freezing (LeDoux et al., 1988), whereas CeL neurons were revealed to tonically inhibit CeM output (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Gozzi et al., 2010). Precisely, activation of SOM-expressing CeL neurons results rather in local inhibition within CeL, especially inhibiting PKC-expressing cells than inhibition of CeM neurons, as they do not send noticeable projections to the CeM (Li et al., 2013). In contrast, the PKC-containing CeL neurons strongly project to and inhibit CeM neurons (Haubensak et al. (2010); Li et al. (2013), Fig. 1.6, part c). Hence, during the presence of fearful stimuli, CeL projection neurons are tonically inhibited by CeLON, SOM-immunopositive neurons (Gozzi et al., 2010), leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons and the induction of freezing. However, when SOM-containing neurons are silenced, PKC-expressing CeLOFF projection neurons become active, inhibiting brainstem-projecting CeM output. Therefore, the balance between the activation of these two parallel CeA subpopulations greatly impacts the behavioral output of this region. CeA projections are illustrated in Figure 1.6, part b. Broadly, both CeM and CeL neurons send substantial projections, especially to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), but also the BNST and LC, affecting fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, such as freezing (Asok et al., 2018; Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2018). Moreover, in addition to its well-known role in generating freezing behavior, PAG is also a crucial component of the pain pathway (Paretkar &amp; Dimitrov, 2019). Reward-related behaviors are modulated not only by CeA projections to the SN, the VTA, and the LH (Tsumori et al., 2006; Reyes et al., 2011; Pomrenze et al., 2015) but also CeM neurons were reported to innervate PFC (Seo et al., 2016), which stimulation was shown to mediate brain reward function. CeM cells projecting to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) are also implicated in autonomic regulation (Viviani et al., 2011). 1.2.4 Summary Taken together, each nucleus receives a unique set of multiple inputs from distinct brain regions. These combinations of connections between BLA and CeA, including the feedforward inhibition generated by intercalated neurons, enable increasing or decreasing the amplitude of the CeA responses depending on which set of amygdala nuclei are activated and in what sequence. Thus, the CeA output depends not only on the nature and intensity of received inputs but also on their timing and origin. All of these may enable the amygdala complex to play a crucial role in surprisingly diverse functions, including emotional memory formation, social interactions, affective and parental behavior, and homeostatic control. Considering this diversity, it is not surprising that the disruption of the amygdala functioning is associated with many disorders, including alcoholism and other reward-related disorders, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and stress-related disorders, autism, obesity, epilepsy, pain, just to list a few. Thus, the amygdala functions as an integrative hub that converts emotionally relevant sensory information about the external and internal environment into behavioral and physiologic responses, playing a crucial role in homeostasis. Finally, as amygdalar circuitry and function are well-conserved across evolution (Jarvis et al., 2005), better understanding the complexity of this circuit using animal models has the potential to be directly relevant to humans. "],["aim-of-the-study.html", "2 Aim of the study", " 2 Aim of the study Considering described evidence, this dissertation aimed to investigate the modulation of two amygdalar subdivisions, namely BLA and CeA, by two chosen chemokines. I focused on CXCL12 and CX3CL1, as they, together with their receptors, were implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, synaptic transmission, neuroimmune responses, and glial regulation. Moreover, the amygdala is involved in the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases, including neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety, in which both CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 pairs are thought to play an important role. To better understand chemokines modulation at the network level of the whole complex of the amygdala, both the main input nucleus (the basolateral complex) and the main output nucleus (the central complex) were investigated. Previous studies have demonstrated complex electrophysiological effects of CXCL12 and CX3CL1, which differ between, among others, brain regions or neuronal populations (see Section: 1.1.3). Receptors of CXCL12 and CX3CL1 chemokines are also located in the amygdala (see Sections: 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3); however, little is known about their functional consequences. Thus, the aim of this dissertation was to investigate the electrophysiological role of chosen chemokines and their receptors in the BLA and the CeA. Moreover, at least some chemokine-triggered actions were mediated by glial cells. Accordingly, this dissertation further aimed to dissect the complex mechanisms underlying bidirectional crosstalk between neurons and glial cells (i.e., astrocytes and microglia) regarding its regulation of membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the amygdala. The central hypotheses of the research presented here are: Chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed in the BLA and/or CeA in both neuronal and glial cells. Chemokines directly and/or indirectly via glial modulation alter neuronal membrane properties and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and/or central nuclei of the amygdala. Therefore, this project can be sub-divided into four separate but physiologically and functionally related parts. Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CX3CL1 and its receptor, CX3CR1, in the rat central nucleus Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CXCL12 and their receptor, CXCR4, in the rat basolateral nucleus Investigation of electrophysiological actions of CXCL12 and their receptor, CXCR4, in the rat central nucleus To address these issues, a whole-cell patch-clamp technique, supplemented with pharmacological approach, was employed. Precisely, to examine the membrane properties and synaptic transmission of BLA and CeA neurons in brain slices and their sensitivity to chosen chemokine treatment, in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in rat brain slices containing the amygdala. BLA or CeA neuron membrane properties, spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (sEPSCs/mEPSCs/sIPSCs/mIPSCs) were collected before and after bath application of chosen chemokines. Notably, to verify whether astrocytes or microglia are involved in observed effects, in subsets of experiments, recordings were made in the presence of either astrocytic toxin (i.e., fluorocitrate) or the inhibitor of microglial activity (i.e., minocycline). To gain additional insights into the role of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the amygdala, additional experiments were made to measure their potential modulation of synaptic plasticity. The co-localization of CX3CR1 expression with neuronal markers such as MAP2 or CAMKII was also examined by using immunohistochemistry.

Procedures in immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments were additionally conducted in accordance with the Polish Act on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific or Educational Purposes of 15 January 2015, and approved by the 2nd Local Ethics Commissions on Animal Research (Krakow, Poland). All efforts were made to minimize suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. 3.1.2 Animals Male Wistar rats (50-180g on arrival) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Research Models and Services; Germany). Four to five animals were housed per polypropylene cage (55x35x20 cm) lined with wooden bedding in a controlled environment (22 ± 1°C, 45 ± 5 % relative humidity, 12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) with commercial food and fresh water ad libitum. Animals were acclimated to the housing environment for at least four days before the beginning of the experiments. For patch-clamp experiments, rats weighing 200-300g (6-7 weeks of age) were used. For immunostaining experiments, rats weighing 300-350 g were used. Animals at this age are considered young adults. The age of the animals for each experiment was determined to assure credible and interpretable results. 3.1.3 Reagents In electrophysiological experiments, all reagents used for preparing ACSF and internal solution were purchased from Roth (Carl Roth GmbH, Germany) and bath-applied by a peristaltic pump, unless stated otherwise. Other electrophysiological reagents suppliers and used doses were as follows: 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker from Tocris Bioscience, UK), 100 M picrotoxin (a GABAA receptor antagonist from Tocris Bioscience, UK), 10 M CGP52432 (a GABAB receptor antagonist from Tocris Bioscience, UK). Chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were purchased from R&amp;D Systems. All peptides were dissolved in sterile PBS, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C, unless stated otherwise. Concentrations for both chemokines were 2 and 5nM. For blocking CX3CL1 and CXCL12 receptors, highly selective antagonists (AZD8797 and AMD3100) were used, respectively. AZD8797 was obtained from Axon Medchem, The Netherlands, and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at the concentration of AZD8797 was 10M. AMD3100 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and its final concentration was 1M. For microglia and astrocytes inhibition, the minocycline and fluorocitric acid were used, respectively. Both reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Minocycline was freshly dissolved in ACSF at the final concentration (20M) before recordings. Fluorocitric acid was used at concentration 100M. The determination of the doses for CX3CL1, CXCL12, AZD8797, AMD3100, minocycline, and fluorocitric acid was based on previous studies (Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2010; Scianni et al., 2013; Sheridan et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Baxter et al., 2021). All drugs were dissolved in deionized water, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C, unless stated otherwise. The drugs were diluted to the final concentration in the recording ACSF just before use. 3.2 Electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices 3.2.1 Tissue preparation for electrophysiological experiments Male Wistar (6-7-week-old) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (AErrane, Baxter, Poland) and decapitated between 07:00 and 09:00 a.m. Brains were collected in ice-cold, low-sodium, high-magnesium ACSF (artificial cerebrospinalfluid), containing (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.4 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl2, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2), pH 7.4; osmolarity 290300 mOsmol kg1) and cut into 300 m thick coronal sections for patch-clamp experiments and 400 m thick coronal sections for extracellular recordings on a Leica VT 1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Instruments, Germany). After slicing, brain slices containing the amygdala were transferred and held in an incubation chamber filled with carbogenated ACSF, containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 30 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, 2 MgSO4, and 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290300 mOsmol kg1). Slices were incubated at 3133°C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT). After this recovery period, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber placed on a fixed stage of a Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) upright microscope, where the tissue was perfused (1-2 ml/min) with carbogenated, warm (32°C) ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 30 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 2 MgSO4 and 10 glucose, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 290300 mOsmol kg1). 3.2.2 Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and data acquisition Neurons were identified based on their location and somatic morphological characteristics under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC). The image from the microscope was enhanced using a CCD camera and displayed on a computer monitor. The border of the basolateral and central amygdala was identified based on visual control by low magnification objective (2.5 x) and referenced to the Paxinos Atlas (Paxinos &amp; Watson, 2007), corresponding to -1.92 mm -3.12 caudal to bregma (see Figure: 3.1). Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen. Cells were approached under visual control with a patch pipette using a three-dimensional micromanipulator (uMp micromanipulator system, Sensapex, Finland). Recording micropipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (36 M; Sutter Instruments, USA) using a horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments P97) and filled with the following solutions. Figure 3.1: (a) A schematic of the brain slice containing the amygdala (b, c) Photographs from the recording microscope under 10x optics showing areas of recordings: BLA and CeA, respectively d,e Photographs from the recording microscope under 40x DIC optics showing morphologies from BLA principal cells and CeL neurons For experiment measuring excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability, the intrapipette solution contained (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 0.4 Na3GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.35, osmolarity 290-300 mOsmol kg1) and biocytin (0.1%, for subsequent immunofluorescent identification of recorded neurons). For experiment measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the solution contained 122 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na2, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH = 7.35; osmolarity 280-290 mOsmol kg1. The pipette was positively pressurized to help prevent contamination of the tip and to blow aside surrounding tissue and lowered to the vicinity of the membrane, keeping a positive pressure. After forming a high-resistance seal (&gt; 1 G, cell-attached configuration) between the recording pipette and cell membrane by applying negative pressure, the second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the patch of membrane enclosed with the pipettes tip and access inside of the neuron. Electrical contact between the cytoplasm and a patch electrode was established (whole-cell configuration). After break-in, cells stabilized for 5 min, during which intracellular solution slowly diffuses from the pipette into the cytoplasm. Ground electrode, which was chloride-coated silver wire in a chamber filled with bath solution, kept the electrical potential of the outer side of the cell membrane at 0 mV. The electrical potential of the inner side of the cell membrane was controlled through a patch electrode filled with the intrapipette solution with chlorided silver wire connected to headstage (CV-4 Headstage, Axon Instruments, USA) and Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument, USA). Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20kHz, and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440, Molecular Devices, USA). Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, USA). All membrane potentials were corrected for the liquid junction potential (estimated as 12 mV). The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. Only recordings with stable access resistance lower than 20 M were considered acceptable for analysis. All drugs were delivered via a bath perfusion system. 3.2.2.1 Recording protocols, data analysis, and statistics Whole-cell patch-clamp can detect transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration or measure membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration. Hence, to measure the effects of chemokines (CX3CL1/CXCL12) on intrinsic membrane properties, the experiments were recorded in the whole-cell patch-clamp under the current-clamp configuration. The measured features are illustrated in Fig. 3.2. First, 10 minutes after breaking into the cell, the resting membrane potential (RMP) was recorded. Then, several membrane parameters were assessed based on neuronal voltage responses from -65 mV holding potential to hyper- and depolarizing current pulses (500 ms, 10 or 5pA increments), and analyzed using custom scripts. An input resistance (Rm), a membrane time constant (m), and membrane capacitance (Cm) were determined in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses eliciting voltage shifts whose amplitude was 1020 mV negative to rest. Rm was measured following Ohms law (Rm = \\(\\frac{dV~m~}{I}\\)), where dVm is the change in membrane potential in response to - 20 pA (500 ms) current injection (I). m was determined at the beginning of the voltage response and computed by fitting it to a single exponential. Cm calculated according to the equation Cm= \\(\\frac{\\tau~m~}{R~m~}\\)). Cell excitability was determined by analyzing the number of action potentials evoked by current steps of increasing amplitude and fitting a linear regression model (see Fig. 3.2, parts a and b). A gain (slope) and a threshold current/rheobase (minimal current necessary to fire the first action potential) were determined for further analysis. An action potential threshold corresponding to the voltage threshold of the first action potential elicited by a current step was defined as the voltage at which the time derivative of Vm(\\(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\\)) is 20 V s1. The spike latency (often referred to as onset or delay) was measured from the start of square depolarizing current pulse injection to the peak of the first action potential evoked by the rheobase. The amplitude of the first action potential (AP; measured from the threshold to the positive peak of the rheobase) and AP width (measured at half-amplitude) were also analyzed. The maximal firing rate (Fmax) was defined as the trace with the largest number of action potentials. The first interspike interval (ISIfirst, in ms) was defined as the time interval between the threshold of the first action potential and the threshold of the second action potential in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current injection. The last interspike interval (ISIlast, in ms) was defined as the time interval between the threshold of the penultimate action potential and the threshold of the last action potential in response to a 500-ms depolarizing current injection. The spike adaptation ratio was regarded as the ratio of ISIfirst to ISIlast. In some cases, especially in the CeL neurons, the sag, post-inhibitory rebound spikes, or spontaneous firing were present. However, these features were scarce and were not considered in further analysis due to the possibility of inconsistent results.

(b) Exemplary traces of evoked action potentials to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections. APs were elicited from a membrane potential of -65 mV.

(d) Exemplary zoomed trace of voltage waveform to hyperpolarizing current injection, showing measured Rm, Cm, and tau. e Exemplary waveform of a single, evoked action potential illustrating several measured properties. Numbers correspond to features described in the text. In another set of experiments, the aim was to investigate the influence of either CX3CR1 or CXCR4 receptors activation on sEPSCs/mEPSCs/sIPSCs/mIPSCs, performed in normal ACSF and ACSF containing TTX (500 nM), respectively in the voltage-clamp configuration (see Fig. 3.3). The details of additional experimental conditions are provided in Results (Chapter 4). At holding potential of -70mV, inward events represented excitatory postsynaptic currents (Fig. 3.3a), whereas to record inhibitory postsynaptic currents, neurons were voltage-clamped at 0 mV and represented as outward events (Fig. 3.3b). After 10 min of the stabilization period, the baseline postsynaptic currents activity was recorded. The action of chosen chemokine was measured before (baseline) and during 15 min of chemokine superfusion. For analysis, the 4-minute-long recordings from baseline and after 15 minutes of chemokine application were selected. From detected events, their median frequency, amplitude, rise time, and decay time were measured (see Fig. 3.3). These parameters were statistically tested (baseline versus chemokine application). Group data for excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission are reported as median±SD. At first, postsynaptic currents were detected using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., USA) or TaroTools toolbox for Igor Pro (https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister, v8.0.4, USA). However, these software required subjective selection of the threshold amplitude of events and visual inspection of the researcher to prevent the inclusion of false data. It leads to a semi-automatic approach, which might be prone to error and researcher bias. Thus, a machine learning-based approach was used. To this end, Eventer (Winchester et al., 2020) software allowed training a model to implement consistent selection criteria across data sets without bias. The same traces were analyzed using all of these software and selection based on models trained in Eventer was the most rigorous, thereby the occurrence of false positive events is less likely. Importantly, the differences between the control and experimental conditions remained unchanged (data not shown). Hence, the synaptic transmission data presented in this dissertation was done using a machine-learning approach in Eventer software. All statistical tests and plotting were done using 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2021), with mainly the dplyr (v0.8.3; Wickham et al. (2021)), and the ggplot2 (v3.2.1; Wickham (2016)) packages. To compare membrane properties and synaptic transmission between different groups, they were analyzed using paired t-test. For non-normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used.

Neurons were identified by location, the shape of a cell body, and morphology, but mainly by specific firing properties (see Fig. 3.1). 3.2.2.2.1 Electrophysiological identification of principal cells in the BLA Principal neurons were identified based on their unique set of features (see section Amygdala 1.2.1). The classification was made using criteria derived from other morphological and electrophysiological studies (Washburn &amp; Moises, 1992b; Paré et al., 1995; Faber &amp; Sah, 2002; Sosulina et al., 2006; Jasnow et al., 2009; Popescu &amp; Paré, 2011). In addition to their pyramidal-like soma shape, these cells were distinguished from a heterogeneous group of interneurons based on such firing properties: (a) their prominent spike adaptation ratio, (b) low excitability (around 6-20 Hz), (c) absence of spontaneous firing, (d) low input resistance (50-100 M), and (e) comparatively long duration of action potential (&lt; 0.8 ms at half-amplitude). Considering the heterogeneity of principal cells, especially with regard to adaptation ratio, the more reliable criteria were the action potential duration, the first inter-spike interval, and low input. Thus, neurons whose action potential was wider than 0.8 ms, first ISI exceeded 20ms and showing input resistance larger than 150 M were excluded from further analysis. Given that principal cells constitute around 90% of the whole neuronal population in the BLA, by chance alone, a sample of BLA neurons should mainly comprise this class of neurons. Hence, by applying these strict criteria, the probability of including interneurons in the further analysis was much lowered. 3.2.2.2.2 Electrophysiological identification of neurons in the CeA Neurons in the CeL display heterogeneous intrinsic excitability (Amano et al. (2012); Haubensak et al. (2010); Hou et al. (2016); Hunt et al. (2017); Lopez de Armentia &amp; Sah (2004); Martina et al. (1999); Sah &amp; Lopez De Armentia (2003); see chapter Amygdala 1.2.3). Based on their response to somatic current injections, the majority of them (~96%) exhibit either the Regular-Spiking or the Late-Firing phenotype in response to depolarizing current steps. The remaining 4% comprise other types of CeL neurons (often designated as fast-spiking and low-firing); however, they were encountered too infrequently (3.5 and 1.5%, respectively) to allow reliable quantitative analyses. Thus, they were excluded from further analysis. The Late-Firing neurons show a significant delay before the onset of the first action potential (100200 ms). During this delay, the membrane potential depolarized slowly in such a way there is a depolarizing ramp (see Fig. 3.4b, upper trace). Little or no spike-frequency adaptation was seen in these neurons. The Regular-Spiking neurons, also described as Early-Spiking, exhibit shorter AP onset, 50 ms, and a more prominent adaptation ratio. However, similar to what was observed by Hunt et al. (2017), the AP onset highly varied in recorded cells regardless of their type. Given that the classification based on the presence of spike frequency accommodation was reported to be reliable (Hou et al., 2016; Hunt et al., 2017), the classification was based on both the AP onset and the presence of spike frequency adaptation. In addition, regarding experiments measuring inhibitory synaptic transmission, the cesium-based internal solution was used, which significantly altered the action potential properties of neurons shortly after the beginning of the recordings (Golding et al., 1999). The identification of CeL neurons included in the present study was therefore achieved immediately after rupture of the Gigaseal by evaluating the firing response to the injecting of depolarizing current. Additional verification was also the observation that even during long-lasting recordings, Late-Firing neurons exhibited the presence of the depolarizing ramp at subthreshold current step. Figure 3.4: Classification of types of neurons in the amygdala (a) An exemplary traces of firing patterns of BLA neurons. The presented traces were injected with the currents that evoked the first action potential, the next one around 300pA, and the next being 400pA. (b) An exemplary traces of firing patterns of CeA neurons. Note the depolarizing voltage at subthreshold current in Late-Firing neurons. Scale bars: 10mV, 100ms 3.2.3 Extracellular recordings, data acquisition, and statistics Extracellular recordings and analysis was done by Bartosz Bobula, PhD, from the Department of Physiology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences As the BLA is widely known to be involved in emotional learning and memory, and mounting evidence points to CX3CL1 as a crucial player in these phenomena, additional experiments investigating the role of CX3CL1 in the BLA LTP was performed. Slices containing the BLA were transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused at 2 ml/min with a recording ACSF (33.5 ± 0.5°C), the same as for patch-clamp recordings. Recordings began approx. 1.5 h after slice preparation. For field potentials (FPs) recording, a bipolar stimulating electrode and a recording electrode were visually positioned under a dissecting microscope in the external capsule and the basolateral region of the amygdala, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.1 A Pt-Ir electrode (CBARC85, FHC, USA) was used for stimulation, whereas recordings were made using ACSF-filled glass micropipettes (12 M), pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a List-Medical L/M 3P-A micropipette puller. The recording electrode was placed in the slice in the area corresponding with the BLA. Stimuli (duration: 0.2 ms) were applied at 0.016 Hz using a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (WPI). Signals were amplified (Axoprobe 1A, Axon Instruments, USA), filtered (1-500 Hz), A/D converted at 10 kHz and stored using the Micro1401 interface and SIGAVG 4 software (CED, UK). A stimulusresponse (inputoutput) curve was obtained for each slice. For that purpose, stimulation intensity was progressively elevated step-wise (21 steps; 0100 A, with 5 A increments). In all experiments, baseline responses were established by delivering a stimulation of sufficient intensity to elicit a response representing 30% of the maximal amplitude of the evoked field potentials, which was fixed at this level throughout all experiments. Stimulus-response curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: Vi= Vmax /(1 + exp((u-uh)/-S)), where Vmax is the maximum FP amplitude; ustimulation intensity; uhstimulation intensity evoking the FP of half-maximum amplitude; Sfactor proportional to the slope of the curve. To measure the short-term plasticity, the paired-pulse stimulation protocol was used (duration0.2 ms, inter-stimulus interval ISI50ms). The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the second FP to the amplitude of the first FP. After 15 minutes of baseline recording, the LTP was induced using theta burst stimulation (TBS). It consisted of 10 trains of stimuli at 5 Hz, repeated five times every 15 s. Each train consisted of five pulses at 100 Hz. During TBS, pulse duration was extended to 0.3 ms. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded at 0.016 Hz for another hour. The amount of LTP was determined as an average increase in the amplitude of FPs recorded between 45 and 60 min after TBS, relative to baseline. The health of the slice was monitored by continuously recording extracellular field potentials throughout experiments. Slices displaying unstable baseline recording were discarded. Data are presented as group means ± SEM. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test or ANOVA with post hoc Tukeys test for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). 3.3 Immunohistochemistry 3.3.1 Immunohistochemistry in primary neuronal cultures from amygdala The preparation of neuronal cultures and imaging was done by Izabela Figiel-Oóg, PhD and Prof. Jakub Wodarczyk from Laboratory of Cell Biophysics, Nencki Institute, Warsaw. Primary cultures of amygdala neurons were prepared from postnatal day 0 (P0) Wistar rats. Animals were decapitated, and the amygdala was removed and immersed in ice-cold dissection buffer (DB) containing: 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, and 9 mM D-glucose. Amygdala tissue was sliced and then enzymatically digested with a mixture of protease A (P5147, Sigma-Aldrich) and thermolysin (P1512, Sigma-Aldrich) in DB at room temperature for 30 minutes. The cells were then dissociated by triturating with pasteur pipette in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, 14175095, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 80 µg/ml DNase (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 250 x g. Resulting cell pellet was suspended in plating media consisting of: Neurobasal A (10888022, ThermoFisher Scientific), B27 supplement (17504044, ThermoFisher Scientific), Glutamax (35050061, ThermoFisher Scientific), Penicillin-streptomycin (15140122, ThermoFisher Scientific), and 5% fetal bovine serum (16140071, ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were plated at density 50,000 cells per 13 mm diameter coverslips coated with 50 µg/ml poly-D-lysine (P7886, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 µg/ml laminin. Next day a medium was exchanged for maintenance medium (Neurobasal A, B27 supplement, Glutamax, and Penicillin-streptomycin). The cultures were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2, and medium was changed every 5 days. After 2 weeks in vitro, the cultures were used for immunofluorescence staining. The cells were fixed in a mixture of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA)/4% (wt/vol) sucrose/PBS for 6 min at room temperature. After nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-CX3CR1 (1:250) diluted in 2% BSA/PBS at 4°C overnight. Following washing with PBS, a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 was applied for 1 h 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed again with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 5 min, and incubated with chicken anti-MAP2 antibody (1:10 000), followed by incubation with secondary anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 antibody. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in an anti-quenching medium (Fluoromount) and subjected to imaging analysis. The images were acquired under a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (63× objective, 1.4 NA). 3.3.2 Immunohistochemistry on brain slices Rats (n = 6) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described in the study by Makowiak et al. (2011). After a post-fixation period of 12 h, 50m-thick sections of the brain were cut in the coronal plane using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000). To analyze co-localization of CX3CR1 with neurons in the BLA or CeA, slices containing amygdala were initially washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and then blocked for 1 h (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS). CX3CR1 localization to neurons was determined by a sequential incubation of brain slices with a rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibody (1:100; Torrey Pines Biolabs, USA) with a mouse anti-CAMKII (1:1000; Invitrogen, USA). Antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4°C, and slices were kept in the dark following the addition of the mouse antibodies. Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized with an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) and an Alexa 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Next, brain sections were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min each) and placed in a cocktail of Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCR4 and CX3CL1, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) to detect CXCL12 and CX3CR1, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Sections were washed in PBS three more times before sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and cover slipped with Prolong Gold Antifade. The specificity of the staining or antibodies was tested in previous studies (Erondu &amp; Kennedy, 1985; Verge et al., 2004). Furthermore, additional tests for secondary antibody specificity were conducted on brain slices with the omission of primary antibodies, and no specific staining was detected (data not shown). 3.3.3 Image analysis In order to address the co-localization between cell type markers and chemokines/CKRs of interest, fluorescent images (z-stacks) have been acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescence microscope equipped with the Apotome.2 optical sectioning module (Carl Zeiss) 63x/1.4 oil immersion plan apochromatic objective. Three-channel images were acquired DAPI, CX3CR1, and CAMKII. All image analysis, cell counts, and fluorescence measurements were performed off-line on captured images taken from stained sections using open-source Fiji imaging software. The total number of positively identified cells expressing CX3CR1 was counted manually in individual brain sections. The number of cells was counted in the basolateral amygdala. All DAPI-labeled cells expressing markers (CAMKII) were counted in the BLA or CeA and subsequently classified as total CAMK+-labeled cells. The percentage of marker-labeled neurons that express CX3CR1 in the BLA was calculated as the percentage of the number of double-labeled cells over that of specific marker-positive cells. 3.4 Statistical analysis - general information Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. n represents the number of neurons/slices used in each group, whereas N represents the number of rats per group.

The analysis revealed that following CX3CL1 treatment, the action potentials threshold was significantly more depolarized, as compared to baseline (from -35.68 ± 1.38 to -33.28 ± 1.12 mV, n = 8, N = 5, t = -2.96, df = 7, p = 0.021, paired t-test, see Fig. 4.1b). Hence, a higher current injection is needed to induce neuronal firing, suggesting that pyramidal-like neurons may be less excitable in the presence of CX3CL1. As shown in Fig. 4.1d1), the gain (slope) remained unchanged (baseline = 0.04 ± 0.006, CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.04 ± 0.006, see Fig. 7.1 and 7.2 in the Appendix 7.3.1.1). Similar effects were observed in higher dose (baseline = -36.72 ± 0.96, CX3CL1(5nM) = -34.21 ± 1.12 mV, n = 14, N = 6, t = -5.08, df = 13, p = 0.0002, paired t-test, see Fig. 4.1b). The two approaches were used to confirm whether CX3CL1-induced reduction in excitability is dependent on the CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1. First, before recordings, a subset of slices was incubated with antibodies against CX3CR1 (2ng/ml). Under such experimental conditions, the CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells excitability was not statistically significant; however, there still was a proportion of neurons responding with an increased action potential threshold (Fig. 4.1b). Notably, slices used in this study were 300 m thin, and the antibody penetration was limited to ( 50 , Fogarty et al. (2013)). To this end, another subset of experiments was performed using a pharmacological approach with AZD8797 to inhibit CX3CR1 (Ridderstad Wollberg et al., 2014). As shown in Fig. 4.1, AZD8797 prevented the CX3CL1-induced decrease in principal cells excitability, manifested as an increased action potential threshold, and thereby additionally confirmed CX3CR1 mediation in the observed effect (t = -0.61, df = 5, p = 0.568, paired t-test, n = 6, N = 5). Of note, AZD9787 did not affect this parameter when applied alone (Fig. 4.2a, baseline in DMSO = -43.02 ± 1.4, AZD8797(10M) = -44.18 ± 1.29 mV, n = 8, N = 8, t = 2.07, df = 7, p = 0.077, paired t-test). Since it is well-known that the CX3CR1 receptor is mostly expressed on microglia, next, the possible involvement of this type of glial cells in mediating CX3CL1-induced reduction of PCs excitability was investigated. For this reason, the slices were pretreated with 100M minocycline, a tetracycline-like antibiotic known to inhibit microglial activation, before and during CX3CL1 application. As presented in Fig. 4.1, the inhibition of microglial activity also diminished the CX3CL1-triggered effect on the action potential threshold (t = -0.66, df = 13, p = 0.522, paired t-test). In contrast, the minocycline applied alone increased the excitability of PCs (baseline = -41.79 ± 0.95, minocycline (100M) = -43.97 ± 1.67 mV, n = 9, N = 5, t = 2.55, df = 8, p = 0.034, paired t-test, Fig. 4.2). Thus, this finding highlights the potential importance of microglial functions in regulating the activity of neurons in the BLA. Finally, since it is increasingly evident that a heterogeneous group of interneurons tightly controls the activity of principal cells in the BLA (see Introduction 1.2.1), it was investigated whether blocking GABAA and GABAB receptors would eliminate this depressing effect on PCs firing by CX3CL1. For this reason, recordings were made with the additional presence of the picrotoxin (100M) and CGP52432 (10M), respectively. As expected, the CX3CL1 effect was fully abolished when the GABAA and GABAB receptors were blocked (baseline = -39.47 ± 1.28, CX3CL1 (2nM) = -38.99 ± 2.22 mV, n = 9, N = 4, t = -0.32, df = 8, p = 0.754, paired t-test, Fig. 4.1b). Thus, these data suggest that CX3CL1 reduced principal cells firing via a CX3CR1-, microglia-, and interneuron-dependent manner.

Scale bar: 10mV, 100ms 4.1.2 Excitatory synaptic transmission is not significantly changed after the CX3CL1 application Having established a significant CX3CL1-modulated suppression of principal cells firing, the main group of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA, the potential contribution of CX3CL1 on the modulation of the excitatory transmission in this area was measured. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded via whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (held at 70 mV). All measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission before and after applying CX3CL1, AZD8797, and minocycline are described in detail in Appendix 7.3.1.2, summarized in Table 7.2, and illustrated in Fig. 7.3. Compared to the control, CX3CL1 in both measured concentrations (2nM and 5nM) had a negligible effect on the median value of the amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of sEPSCs. However, although statistically not significant, a proportion of neurons ( 50%) reacted with a decreased frequency of excitatory synaptic currents (Fig. 4.3a). Furthermore, in addition to upregulated excitability, minocycline alone also altered sEPSC kinetics by increasing both their rise time from 0.51 ± 0.05 ms to 0.56 ± 0.05 ms, n = 9, N = 5, t = -3.33, df = 8, p = 0.01, paired t-test) and decay time from 8.23 ± 0.16 ms to 8.53 ± 0.23 ms, n = 9, N = 5, t = -2.71, df = 8, p = 0.027, paired t-test)(Fig. 4.3b1-b3). Thus, these observations suggest that microglia may be one of the key contributors regulating excitatory drive in the BLA. Figure 4.3: The effects of CX3CL1 and minocycline on the frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission (a) Boxplot showing complex effect of CX3CL1 on excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells, where the proportion of neurons showed the enhanced frequency of sEPSC at the concentration of 2nM, whereas, at 5nM, the inhibition of the sEPSC frequency is observed in a subset of cells. (b1-2) Boxplots illustrating kinetics of sEPSC before and after minocycline application. (b3) Overlay of median sEPSCs from traces recording during baseline (blue) and after minocycline treatment (red). Scale bar: 2pA, 10ms 4.1.3 CX3CL1 decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission These results revealed that the CX3CL1-induced downregulation of principal cells excitability was also associated with GABAA and GABAB receptors (see Fig.4.1). This is in line with mounting evidence pointing to local interneurons as key regulators of the activity of pyramidal-like neurons (see Introduction 1.2.1). Hence, the possible influence of CX3CL1 on the inhibitory transmission onto BLA PCs was next explored in in vitro slices. Cells were clamped at 0 mV to record sIPSCs. The representative traces of sIPSCs in the absence (baseline) and presence of CX3CL1 (2nM and 5nM) are shown in Fig.4.4. At 2nM, CX3CL1 was ineffective in changing any of the sIPSCs measured parameters (for details, see Appendix 7.3.1.3), whereas higher concentration (5nM) of CX3CL1 robustly reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA by decreasing the median frequency from 5 ± 0.415 to 3.45 ± 0.627 Hz and the median amplitude from 24.03 ± 2.358 to 20.93 ± 1.979 pA, respectively, compared to the baseline. Further analysis of IPSCs kinetics showed that the median rise times and decay times remained unchanged (from 1.16 ± 0.094 to 1.18 ± 0.055 ms and from 27.47 ± 0.508 to 27.9 ± 0.514 ms, respectively), as reported by data in Fig. 7.4 in Appendix 7.3.1.3. Similar to what was observed in experiments assessing PCs excitability, this drastic reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission followed by CX3CL1 treatment was eliminated by both AZD8797 and minocycline. In particular, following CX3CL1(5nM) application, the presence of the CX3CR1 inhibitor and the blocker of microglial activity resulted in the 1.24 ±1.07% and 1.35 ± 0.96% of the baseline median frequency, respectively. These findings indicate a functional involvement of CX3CR1 and microglia in the modulation of BLA GABAergic transmission (Fig.4.4). In addition, to determine if a decrease in sIPSC frequency by CX3CL1 was due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, the TTX (500nM) was used to block neuronal firing. The mIPSC amplitude, frequency, and kinetics were measured before and after the CX3CL1 treatment (clamped at 0 mV). No changes in these parameters were found between baseline and CX3CL1-applied recordings (see Fig.4.4b and c, mIPSC frequency: t = -0.79, df = 6, p = 0.459, paired t-test, mIPSC amplitude: t = -0.75, df = 6, p = 0.484, paired t-test). Hence, data presented here suggest that CX3CL1 reduces GABA release at the local BLA synapses, probably by depression of the spontaneous firing of local interneurons. Moreover, this inhibition of GABAergic transmission by 5nM CX3CL1 was mediated by both CX3CR1 and microglia. Figure 4.4: CX3CL1 modulates GABAergic synaptic transmission in the BLA.

To this end, extracellular recordings were employed. The amplitude of field potentials, short-term plasticity, and long-term potentiation were assessed. At the beginning of each experiment, the I/O curves were determined, as shown in Figure 4.5a. No significant differences were evident between the inputoutput curves of FPs recorded from the control and CX3CL1-induced slices (F (3, 41) = 0.4, P=0.75, ANOVA). It indicates that CX3CL1 did not modulate the baseline excitatory activity in the BLA under our experimental conditions. The paired-pulse ratio, a form of short-term plasticity sensitive mainly to presynaptic changes (Stuart &amp; Redman, 1991), was also investigated. PPR, a measure of short-term synaptic plasticity, is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the second response to that of the first, which depends on the probability of vesicular release at the synapse. This parameter also remained unaffected by CX3CL1 treatment (H= 3.930, p = 0.27, Kruskal-Wallis test; see Fig. 4.5b). Thus, the unaffected PPR suggests a similar release probability of glutamate and, therefore, a postsynaptic mechanism of CX3CL1 action. Notably, upon application of Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS), external capsule-evoked field potentials in the BLA were effectively potentiated in the control slices, but not in the slices treated with CX3CL1, as revealed by a significant decrease measured by the comparison of average potentiation before and after LTP induction (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA and Tukeys post hoc test; see Fig.4.5c). However, the additional presence of AZD8797, CX3CR1 antagonist, did not fully abolish this effect (F(2, 26) = 156.6, p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA and Tukeys post hoc test). Together, these findings demonstrate an impairment of BLA synaptic plasticity to external capsule inputs after CX3CL1 treatment.

The basal synaptic transmission was not significantly different between measured conditions. (b) Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) in the BLA.

(c) Graph showing the time course and quantification of fEPSC evoked in the BLA and the LTP induced after a TBS (arrow) in the presence or absence of 2nM CX3CL1 or in a cocktail of 2nM CX3CL1 and AZD8797 (10uM) in the bath solution. fEPSC amplitudes are represented as a percentage of baseline. 4.1.5 CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are expressed in principal cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala The part regarding neuronal cultures was done by Izabela Figiel-Oóg, PhD and Prof. Jakub Wodarczyk from Laboratory of Cell Biophysics, Nencki Institute, Warsaw. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) has been shown to play a critical role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and emotional learning mediated by the basolateral amygdala. This is also a critical marker of principal cells in the BLA (McDonald et al., 2002). Results presented in this dissertation showed that CX3CL1-induced depression of principal cells excitability and the impairment in LTP in the BLA, the immunohistochemistry used to examine the expression level of the CX3CR1 in CAMKII-positive cells in the BLA. As illustrated in Figure 4.6, the CX3CR1 receptor was present in 15.96 ± 1.01% of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA. The results regarding CX3CR1 expression in neurons, especially principal cells, were also confirmed in neuronal cultures of the amygdala. Hence, although all of the electrophysiological effects of the CX3CL1 were prevented by minocycline, the direct action of this chemokine on neurons is also plausible. However, as shown in Fig.4.1c1 and c2, 50% of neurons were responsive when 2nM CX3CL1 was applied, while 5nM CX3CL1 affected a larger fraction of neurons, reaching 65%.

White arrowheads indicate the colocalization of CX3CR1- and CAMKII expressing neurons. Yellow arrows indicate cells that express the CX3CR1, but not CAMKII. A magenta arrow represents a CaMKII-containing neuron, which did not express CX3CR1 receptor. Scale bar: 25 um. b Co-expression of CX3CR1 and neuronal marker MAP2 in primary neuronal cultures from the amygdala. 4.2 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the central amygdala Principal cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala send their projections to the central nucleus (see: Introduction 1.2.3). However, the basolateral and central complexes of the amygdala participate in different extended circuitries. Hence, CX3CL1 may differentially regulate these networks. Thus, to gain insight into the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the CeA circuitry, its functional consequences in this area were examined. 4.2.1 Modulation of intrinsic membrane properties of CeL neurons by CX3CL1 in a cell-type-specific manner The next step was to investigate whether reduced excitability of CX3CL1 in the BLA would affect the membrane properties of their main target, i.e., GABAergic cells in the CeL. To this end, among others, electrophysiological features such as excitability, input resistance, membrane time constant, and resting membrane potential were measured (see: Methods 3.2.2.1). In general, these experiments revealed that several membrane properties in the CeL neurons were significantly modified by CX3CL1 (see Figs. 4.7 and 4.8). However, since CeL neurons demonstrate mainly two types of electrophysiological firing patterns, such as Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons (see: Introduction 1.2.3 and Fig. 3.4b), these intrinsic parameters were further analyzed based on these neuronal subtypes. Intriguingly, while LF cells remained unaffected (see Figs. 4.7 and 4.8, right panels), most RS neurons were responsive to the CX3CL1 treatment, which was reflected by robust changes in their intrinsic properties (Figs. 4.7 and 4.8, middle panels). Specifically, similar to what was observed in the BLA, bath application of CX3CL1 (2nM) produced a decrease in the number of action potentials evoked by a given current step, manifested as a decrease in the gain (baseline = 0.12 ± 0.018, CX3CL1(2nM) = 0.07 ± 0.015, W = 71, p = 0.013, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, see Fig. 4.7). This effect was accompanied by a reduced input resistance (from 503.75 ± 81.861 M to 389.33 ± 76.968 M, W = 69, p = 0.021, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) and membrane time constant (from 28.5 ± 2.278 ms to 22.59 ± 2.23 ms, t = 3.18, df = 11, p = 0.009, paired t-test; Fig. 4.8, middle panel). Moreover, resting membrane potentials of Regular-Spiking CeL neurons become more depolarized in response to bath-applied 2nM CX3CL1, being -56.25 ± 2.75 at baseline and reaching -51.6 ± 2.392, t = -2.28, df = 11, p = 0.043, paired t-test after CX3CL1 treatment (Fig. 4.7a2). AZD8797 alone did not significantly change any of those parameters (see Fig. 7.6 in Appendix 7.3.1.4). All measured parameters and statistics are summarized in Table 7.4.

Scale bar: 10mV, 100ms Notably, similar to what was observed in the BLA, minocycline alone also affected the excitability of CeL neurons, especially the Late-Firing subtype (Fig. 4.9). Specifically, treatment with 100 M minocycline lowered the threshold needed for inducing action potentials in both types of neurons (from -35.64 ± 1.472 mV to -39.46 ± 2.234 mV, t = 2.95, df = 6, p = 0.026, paired t-test in Late Firing neurons and from -38.32 ± 1.339 mV to -41.35 ± 1.573 mV, t = 2.34, df = 6, p = 0.058, paired t-test in Regular Spiking neurons, Fig. 4.9a). However, minocycline-induced increased input resistance and cell capacitance was observed only in Late-Firing neurons (from 431 ± 48.359 to 524.86 ± 55.497, t = -2.88, df = 6, p = 0.028, paired t-test and from 71.86 ± 4.642 to 63.57 ± 4.219, t = 2.95, df = 6, p = 0.026, paired t-test, respectively; Fig.4.9 b and c). All measured parameters are summarized in Table 7.4 in Appendix 7.3.1.4. Figure 4.9: Effects of minocycline on intrinsic neuronal properties in CeL neurons based on their type.

Scale bar: 10mV, 100ms 4.2.2 Effects of CX3CL1 on synaptic transmission in the CeL As CX3CL1 reduced excitability of both the glutamatergic BLA as well as GABAergic CeL neurons, both the excitatory and inhibitory transmission were investigated. Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, no substantial changes were observed in RS and LF neurons. The detailed data is shown in Appendix 7.3.1.5. On the contrary, CX3CL1 application led to a reduction in GABAregic synaptic transmission, manifested as decreased frequency of sIPSCs onto Late-Firing neurons from 1.66 ± 0.185 to 1.45 ± 0.186 Hz, n = 8, N = 6, t = 2.45, df = 7, p = 0.044, paired t-test, Fig. 4.10a1). This effect was abolished when CX3CR1 and microglial activity were blocked by AZD8797 and minocycline, respectively (t = 0.39, df = 5, p = 0.715, paired t-test and t = 0.17, df = 7, p = 0.868, paired t-test). These observations suggest a functional involvement of CX3CR1 and minocycline in the modulation of CX3CL1-induced inhibition of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing cells. To examine whether this effect was mediated by the spontaneous firing of neurons in the slice, the set of experiments were performed in the presence of TTX (see Fig. 4.10). Although 60% of Late-Firing cells reacted with reduction in miniature inhibitory synaptic currents, the statistic did not reach the level of significance (baseline in TTX: 0.65 ± 0.134, TTX + CX3CL1(2nM): 0.55 ± 0.092, n = 7, N = 4, t = 1.2, df = 6, p = 0.277, paired t-test). All details about statistics, number of cells, animals, as well as descriptive analysis are summarized in Table 7.6 in Appendix 7.3.1.6. In contrast, no significant effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission onto CX3CL1-treated Regular-Spiking neurons was found, despite a trend toward increased frequency (baseline: 1.31 ± 0.258, CX3CL1(2nM): 1.58 ± 0.308, n = 10, N = 8, t = -1.29, df = 9, p = 0.23, paired t-test, Fig. 4.10a1). The kinetics of sIPSC and mIPSC remained unaffected, as shown in Fig.7.8 in the Appendix 7.3.1.6. Figure 4.10: CX3CL1 suppresses GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons in the CeL.

The intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic transmission were measured using analogous protocols as in the CX3CL1 study. As assessed by gain and threshold current, no significant changes in basal excitability were found at both CXCL12 concentrations (2nM and 5nM) despite a trend toward increased excitability (Fig. 4.11a). This was especially true for CXCL12 at 5nM concentration; however, a high level of variation is observed (Fig. 4.11b). Further research will be required to independently replicate these findings and further investigate the mechanisms of this effect. Moreover, other measured membrane intrinsic properties of principal cells were also unaffected by CXCL12 treatment, as shown in Fig. 7.9 in Appendix 7.3.2.1). Figure 4.11: 2nM and 5nM CXCL12 does not affect BLA excitability (a1-a2) Plots presenting population data of neurons before (blue) and after(red) CXCL12 treatment as a function of the frequency and injected depolarizing current steps Figure 4.12: Effects of 2nM and 5nM CXCL12 on the frequency of sEPSCs (a1-a2) Plots presenting population data of neurons before (blue) and after(red) CXCL12 treatment as a function of the frequency and injected depolarizing current steps Similarly, to evaluate the potential contribution of the chemokine CXCL12 in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission, the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs were analyzed. As shown in Fig.4.12, at 2nM, the reduction in the frequency of sEPSCs is observed in 3 out of 10 cells following exogenous CXCL12 treatment, whereas this chemokine increased the excitatory transmission onto 4 out of 10 neurons (Fig. 4.12a and b1). When all these neurons are grouped together, there is no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs (t = -0.58, df = 9, p = 0.578, paired t-test). Similarly, when CXCL12 at a concentration of 5nM was bath-applied, 30% of principal cells responded with decreased frequency of sEPSCs, while the glutamatergic synaptic transmission was increased onto 40% of neurons (Fig.4.12a and b2, t = 0.28, df = 6, p = 0.79, paired t-test). These findings also need further replication and investigation of the potential mechanisms underlying opposite effects of CXCL12 on sEPSCs frequency. The remaining data concerning excitatory synaptic transmission are illustrated in Figure 7.10 in Appendix (7.3.2.2). Figure 4.13: Effects of 2nM and 5nM CXCL12 on the frequency and decay time of sIPSCs Finally, the ability of exogenous CXCL12 to mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission was also assessed. Although none of the measured sIPSCs parameters reached statistical significance, there is a trend in the frequency. As shown in Fig.4.13, at the concentration of 2nM, CXCL12 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto 41.6666667 % of principal cells. In contrast, at 5nM, the 8 out of the 15 neurons showed an increased frequency of sIPSCs. In addition, sIPSCs rise time is trendily increased by both doses of CXCL12 (Fig.4.13b and d). However, this multifaceted effect needs further replication and exploration. The details and plots of the amplitude and decay time of sIPSCs following CXCL12 treatment can be found in Appendix 7.3.2.3 and Fig. 7.11. 4.4 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the central amygdala 4.4.1 Enhanced excitability of CeL neurons following CXCL12 treatment First, to investigate the potential involvement of CXCL12 in neuronal activity in the CeL, the intrinsic firing properties of CeL neurons were assessed through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, evoking action potentials in response to somatic current injections. Data reported in Figure 4.14 demonstrates that CXCL12, especially at a higher concentration (5nM), enhanced CeL neurons excitability, measured as threshold current required for the first action potential and gain(slope) as a function of injected current and frequency of firing. As described earlier, two main electrophysiological types of CeL neurons are Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons. Thus, further analysis revealed that although this CXCL12-induced increased firing can be observed in both types of cells (Fig. 4.14, right panel), it is more prominent and statistically significant in Late-Firing neurons, with threshold current during baseline being -37.91 ± 1.955 mV and reaching -40.18 ± 2.095 mV after CXCL12(5nM) treatment, n = 10, N = 7, t = 4.06, df = 9, p = 0.003, paired t-test). These effects were prevented, at least partially, by the selective CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 (baseline in AMD3100: -39.5 ± 2.137 mV, CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 -41.94 ± 2.09 mV, n = 8, N = 4, t = 1.59, df = 7, p = 0.155, paired t-test). Of note, the application of AMD3100 alone led to an opposite trend (from -41.86 ± 3.017 mV to -46.2 ± 5.304 mV, n = 4, N = 4,t = 1.64, df = 3, p = 0.199, paired t-test, Fig.4.14, right panel). These findings suggest that CXCR4 may be involved in the regulation of firing of Late-Firing neurons and possibly its tonic activity in those cells. Given that several studies documented the presence of CXCR4 in astrocytes (Bezzi et al., 2001; Bonavia et al., 2003; Calì &amp; Bezzi, 2010), it was investigated whether the blockade of these glial cells by incubation in astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, would eliminate the observed CXCL12-mediated increase in Late-Firing neurons excitability. This effect was not abolished by an astrocytic inactivation in an acute brain slice (0.91 ±1.41% of baseline, t = -1.85, df = 2, p = 0.205, paired t-test), raising the possibility that CXCL12 might activate CXCR4 directly on Late-Firing neurons, enhancing the excitability of these neurons. Notably, this observation is based on a limited number of neurons (n = 3, N = 3) and, therefore, this finding needs further replication. In addition, despite CXCL12-induced enhancement in CeL neurons excitability, CXCL12 does not modulate any other membrane properties in those neurons, indicating a rather presynaptic mechanism. Figures and detailed descriptions can be found in Appendix 7.3.2.4. Together, these findings illustrate that CXCL12 upregulated LF neurons excitability in the CeL in a CXCR4-dependent and probably astrocytic-independent manner.

Scale bar: 10mV, 100ms 4.4.2 Complex actions of CXCL12 on excitatory synaptic transmission As presented in this dissertation, enhancement of excitability of CeL cells, mainly Late-Firing neurons, triggered by CXCL12 was not accompanied by any other measured membrane parameters, such as the input resistance (see Fig. 7.12 in Appendix 7.3.2.4). Thus, it may be speculated that rather than the involvement of any channel, this effect is a result of upregulated glutamatergic activity onto CeL neurons. To test this hypothesis, spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated. When all CeL neurons are grouped into one category, no differences in the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sEPSCs are observed between baseline and CXCL12 treatment (4.15, left panel). CXCL12 also did not enhance the glutamatergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons (4.15, right panel). Intriguingly, regarding excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Firing neurons, two opposing trends (decreased vs. increased frequency of sEPSCs) were revealed depending on the concentration of CXCL12 used (2nM vs. 5nM; see Fig. (4.15a2)). However, none of these effects reached statistical significance. Nevertheless, several reports indicated the opposing effects of CXCL12 on neuronal function depending on the concentration, and thereby this issue warrants further investigation. Several mechanisms for these opposite effects are reviewed in Guyon &amp; Nahon (2007). A detailed summary of measured parameters of excitatory synaptic transmission, together with Figure 7.14 illustrating the amplitude and kinetics of sEPSCs after CXCL12 treatment can be found in Table 7.11 in Appendix 7.3.2.5. Figure 4.15: Opposing effects of CXCL12 on excitatory synaptic transmission in CeL (a1) Boxplots showing the frequency of sEPSCs before and after CXCL12 treatment in Regular-Spiking neurons. (a2) Boxplots showing the frequency of sEPSCs before and after CXCL12 treatment in Late-Firing neurons. b1-4 Pie charts illustrating the number of neurons responding differently to CXCL12 application in relation to their electrophysiological firing pattern and CXCL12 concentration 4.4.3 CXCL12 modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala Considering that CeL neurons are mostly GABAergic and highly interconnected (see Introduction 1.2.3), CXCL12-triggered enhancement in their excitability may thereby impact the inhibitory synaptic transmission. To test this hypothesis, the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of sIPSCs were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. As expected, the application of CXCL12 on brain slices significantly changed the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission (Figs. 4.16 and 4.17). Analysis, which divided cells into two subgroups based on their electrophysiological types, revealed that CXCL12 at the concentration of 5nM differentially regulated inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CeL. Specifically, CXCL12 enhanced the GABAergic transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons, as manifested by increased frequency of sIPSCs from 0.52 ± 0.132 Hz to 0.66 ± 0.146 Hz (n = 9, N = 7, t = -2.73, df = 8, p = 0.026, paired t-test, Fig.4.16a1), without any changes in the amplitude (baseline: 15.17 ± 1.467 pA, CXCL12(5nM): 13.7 ± 0.73 pA, t = -2.73, df = 8, p = 0.026, paired t-test Fig.4.16a2). To confirm that the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, is responsible for modulation of GABAergic transmission in RS neurons, the CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, was employed. As expected, AMD3100 eliminated the CXCL12-induced increase in the frequency of sIPSC, with 0.59 ± 0.119 Hz in baseline and 0.52 ± 0.107 Hz after CXCL12 treatment (t = 1.13, df = 7, p = 0.296, paired t-test, n = 8, N = 5, Fig.4.16b2). Since CXCR4 is well-known to be functionally expressed on astrocytes, the possible involvement of astrocytes in mediating CXCL12-induced enhancement of GABAergic transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons was investigated. For this reason, prior to CXCL12 treatment, the brain slices were pretreated with fluorocitrate, a toxin known to inhibit astrocytic metabolism. As shown in Fig. 4.16b3, fluorocitrate prevented the CXCL12-triggered increase in the frequency of sIPSCs (0.77 ±0.75% of baseline, t = 2.08, df = 6, p = 0.083, paired t-test, n = 7, N = 5). To determine whether there was a direct effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic terminals, the mIPSCs were recorded. In these experiments, TTX was used to block the action potentials. Under these conditions, the modulation of GABAergic transmission by CXCL12 was partially abolished (mIPSC frequency during baseline: 0.44 ± 0.08 Hz vs. mIPSC frequency after CXCL12 treatment: 0.4 ± 0.112 Hz, t = 0.65, df = 5, p = 0.547, paired t-test, n = 6, N = 6, Fig. 4.16b4). Altogether, these results suggest that the CXCL12-triggered increase in the frequency of sIPSCs was mediated through the stimulation of CXCR4 and probably associated with the increase in spontaneous firing of interneurons, as this effect is eliminated by TTX. However, the inhibition of astrocytes by fluorocitrate was also shown to eliminate the previously described effect of CXCL12 on GABAergic transmission in Regular-Spiking neurons (see 4.16).

Scale bar: 10pA, 1s In contrast, in Late-Firing neurons, CXCL12 significantly reduced the sIPSC amplitude from 14.45 ± 0.86 pA to 12.5 ± 0.611 pA (t = 3.19, df = 12, p = 0.008, paired t-test). This chemokine also lowered the sIPSC frequency from 0.75 ± 0.161 Hz to 0.48 ± 0.076 Hz (n = 13, N = 11, W = 75, p = 0.04, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, Figs. 4.17a3 and b3). These effects were eliminated in the presence of AMD3100, a CXCR4 blocker (baseline amplitude in AMD3100: 13.06 ± 0.536 pA, amplitude after CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 13.21 ± 0.69 pA, t = -0.36, df = 12, p = 0.723, paired t-test, and baseline frequency in AMD3100 0.52 ± 0.142 Hz vs. frequency after CXCL12(5nM) in AMD3100 0.59 ± 0.131 Hz, n = 13, N = 7, W = 41, p = 0.787, paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test). Moreover, the CXCL12-induced reduction in the both frequency and amplitude of sIPSC were also blocked by the astrocytic toxin, flurocitrate (baseline in flurocitrate: 15.15 ± 1.884 pA, CXCL12(5nM) in fluorocitrate: 14.2 ± 0.939 pA, t = 0.87, df = 3, p = 0.449, paired t-test, and baseline frequency in fluorocitrate 15.15 ± 0.061 Hz, CXCL12(5nM) in fluorocitrate: 0.62 ± 0.08 Hz, n = 4, N = 3, t = 1.16, df = 3, p = 0.332, paired t-test). Finally, to determine if decreased sIPSC frequency and amplitude by CXCL12 in Late-Firing cells were due to a change in the spontaneous action potential firing in the slice, TTX was used to block neuronal firing, and the mIPSC parameters were measured before and after the CXCL12 application. CXCL12 was ineffective to modulate both the mIPSCs frequency (1.06 ±1.05% of baseline, t = -0.39, df = 6, p = 0.707, paired t-test) and amplitude (1.06 ±1.6% of baseline, n = 7, N = 6, t = -1.35, df = 6, p = 0.225, paired t-test). Of note, further analysis of the IPSC kinetic parameters showed that the median rise times and decay times of the sIPSCs and mIPSCs from both Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons were unchanged after CXCL12 treatment (Figure 7.15 in Appendix 7.3.2.6). These findings collectively illustrate that the regulation of GABAergic transmission by CXCL12 is cell-specific and dependent on spontaneous neuronal activity and mediated via direct activation of CXCR4 and astrocytes.

Among them, CX3CL1 and CXCL12 are particularly important in this regard, as they are constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where they were shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, as well as the behavioral level (Trettel et al., 2020; Sowa &amp; Tokarski, 2021). Moreover, dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling are implicated in psychiatric diseases, including anxiety-related behaviors (Yang et al., 2016; Schubert et al., 2018). As their receptors, CXCR4 and CX3CR1, are relatively densely present in the amygdala (Harrison et al., 1998; Banisadr et al., 2002; Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Tarozzo et al., 2003), the critical region in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders (Mahan &amp; Ressler, 2012; Duvarci &amp; Pare, 2014; Gilpin et al., 2015), the electrophysiological consequences of their activation were explored. Moreover, since distinct nuclei of the amygdala play different roles in fear processing, it is of interest to investigate whether CX3CL1 and CXCL12 affect electrophysiological properties and synaptic transmission in those regions. To this end, in the presented PhD dissertation, by using a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches, the actions of two chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL12) were determined in two nuclei of the amygdala - basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA). Moreover, considering the pivotal role of chemokines in neuro-glial communication, the aim of experiments was also to explore the glial component of chemokine-modulated effects. Performing all electrophysiological experiments using acute brain slices pretreated with microglial inhibitor and astrocytic toxin allowed for dissecting local neuro-glial cross-talk in these regions. 5.1 CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in the basolateral amygdala Findings of this study provide evidence that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair reduced the excitability of principal cells in the BLA by depolarizing their threshold current, significantly suppressed GABAergic transmission in this area, as well as impaired long-term potentiation at cortico-BLA synapses. These effects were specific for CX3CR1 receptor activation and probably mediated by microglia. Principal cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are well-known to converge information about both conditional and unconditional stimuli. Multiple pairings of those experiences lead to the LTP at excitatory synapses onto BLA neurons, enabling CS alone to induce the freezing behavior (for example, Nabavi et al. (2014)). Moreover, by combining several approaches to label only those neurons involved in fear conditioning (CS+), Kim &amp; Won (2017) found that AMPA/NMDA ratios were explicitly increased in CS+ terminals, confirming an input-specific, postsynaptic nature of this phenomenon. Accordingly, plasticity at synapses onto principal cells in this region is considered to be a candidate mechanism of neural plasticity mediating the acquisition and storage of new fear memories (Blanchard &amp; Blanchard, 1972; LeDoux et al., 1990; Tye et al., 2008; Clem &amp; Huganir, 2010; Johansen et al., 2010). Hence, their activity is tightly regulated by a broad array of factors, including a GABAergic system or different types of neuromodulators (Prager et al. (2016) and references therein). Here, the reduced excitability was demonstrated after the CX3CL1 application, manifested as an increased threshold current needed for eliciting action potentials. Thus, the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of the principal cells firing may have significant consequences on BLA physiology. To block this receptor, two approaches were used. Although pre-incubating slices with an antibody against CX3CL1 abolished the observed effect, a small portion of neurons still remained responsive to CX3CL1. This may be due to the limited tissue penetration of antibodies, estimated around 50m, while slices used for this study were 300m thick. Thus another approach was used by employing the pharmacological inhibitor of the CX3CR1 receptor, AZD8797. The effectiveness of AZD8797 molecule in inhibiting actions of CX3CR1 was validated in cell cultures (Lannes et al., 2019) as well as in vivo administered both intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) (Ho et al., 2020) and intraperitoneally (i.p) in neuropathic pain model (Chen et al., 2020). The concentration used in previous studies, i.e., 10 (Ridderstad Wollberg et al., 2014; Baxter et al., 2021), was also effective in experiments presented here. Moreover, when applied solely, AZD8797 did not affect any measured electrophysiological parameters. Thus, in the remaining experiments, the 10M was applied. The presented CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP is consistent with many previous studies showing CX3CL1-induced inhibition of LTP or mimicking long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2009; Sheridan et al., 2014), without affecting paired-pulse ratio (Bertollini et al., 2006; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Sheridan et al., 2014). Consistently, in this study, a CX3CL1-mediated increase in the threshold current was observed, leading to a reduction of principal cells firing. Many lines of evidence show neuroprotective and beneficial actions of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling. For instance, the expression of CX3CL1 is upregulated in several settings of augmented glutamatergic transmission, such as after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus or ischemia, where it is consistently shown to reduce neurotoxicity (Tong et al., 2000; Tarozzo et al., 2002; Limatola et al., 2005; Cipriani et al., 2011; Yeo et al., 2011). Its beneficial actions were also reported in neurodegenerative models, where it was shown to rescue motor coordination (Morganti et al., 2012) or reduce Tau-pathology (Finneran &amp; Nash, 2019). Moreover, in the hippocampus, CX3CL1 was demonstrated to reduce spontaneous glutamate release and the postsynaptic glutamate currents with a mechanism that involves increased intracellular calcium and dephosphorylation of the GluR1 -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit (Meucci et al., 1998; Limatola et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Lauro et al., 2008), a hallmark of the LTD. Thus, this predominantly inhibitory role is suggested to be a component of neuroprotective synaptic scaling mechanisms necessary for hippocampal memory-associated synaptic plasticity processes (Bertollini et al., 2006; Piccinin et al., 2010; Sheridan et al., 2014). Importantly, in the BLA, many disorders are linked with the increased excitability of pyramidal-like cells along with the elevated magnitude of LTP. Indeed, blocking LTP with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, calcium channel blockers, and protein synthesis inhibitors were reported to disrupt the extinction of conditioned fear, whereas promoting LTP was shown to facilitate extinction (Falls et al., 1992; Walker &amp; Davis, 2002; Yang &amp; Lu, 2005; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2007). Therefore, considering its well-documented neuroprotective role in other brain structures, the reduced activity of PCs along with impaired LTP in the BLA may suggest the anxiolytic actions of CX3CL1. Unlike what is observed in the hippocampus, this study did not find any effects of the CX3CL1 application on excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA. These regional differences between hippocampus and amygdala may be linked to the fact that CX3CL1 does not directly modulate glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, but rather its action is mediated by adenosine, released from microglia upon CX3CR1 receptor activation (Lauro et al., 2008, 2010; Piccinin et al., 2010). As mentioned in the Introduction (see 1.1.3), depending on the adenosinergic receptor activation, adenosine exerts opposing action and tonic activity on glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus (Piccinin et al., 2010). Specifically, further evidence indicated that CX3CL1-induced adenosine action via A1R and A3R receptor led to decreased glutamatergic transmission Lauro et al. (2010), whereas A2AR exerts the opposite effect, manifested as CX3CL1-triggered increase of evoked EPSC (eEPSC), observed when the A1 and A3 receptors are blocked (Piccinin et al., 2010). Moreover, Scianni et al. (2013) demonstrated that CX3CL1 NMDAR component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA-fEPSPs) elicited in the CA1 stratum radiatum by releasing D-serine from glial cells and adenosine, which in turn modulate NMDAR and the A2AR subtype. Thus, these findings raise the possibility that CX3CL1 also induces the release of adenosine in the BLA, which in turn, is a downstream molecule of the observed electrophysiological effects. Consistent with this idea, both A1R and A2AR receptors were documented to modulate the excitatory AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission and LTP (Rau et al., 2014, 2015; Simões et al., 2016), as it was observed in the hippocampus (Mendonça &amp; Ribeiro, 1994; Maggi et al., 2009; Costenla et al., 2011). Importantly, while the study documented the activation of A2AR elevated the amplitude of NMDA currents in the hippocampus (Dias et al., 2012), decreased NMDA-EPSCs were observed following the bath-application of A2AR agonists in the amygdala (Pliássova et al., 2020). This opposing action of adenosine between these two regions on the excitatory synaptic transmission might account for the differences in glutamatergic currents observed in the present study after CX3CL1 treatment. Alternatively, the high variability of the CX3CL1-triggered effect on excitatory synaptic transmission possibly depends upon the relative contribution of both excitatory inputs from other pyramidal-like cells in the BLA and GABAergic synapses from local interneurons. As mentioned in the Introduction (see 1.1.3), distal dendrites of principal neurons receive high levels of excitatory synaptic inputs from both outside and within the BLA (Brinley-Reed et al., 1995; Farb &amp; LeDoux, 1997; Farb &amp; Ledoux, 1999). This subcellular domain is also the target of local somatostatin-positive interneurons (Muller et al., 2007). Thus, SOM-expressing neurons may influence how EPSPs travel along the dendritic arbor, summating and activating voltage-gated conductances. As whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in this study were made from the soma, and the potassium-based intrapipette solution was used, excitatory synaptic currents originating from distal parts of dendrites needed to travel more distance, and therefore, could be decreased by GABAergic synapses. Hence, they might not be detected from baseline noise. Noting that cesium blocks potassium currents, additional experiments using cesium-based intrapipette solution might resolve whether CX3CL1 mediate changes contributed by inputs to more distal dendrites (Williams &amp; Mitchell, 2008). In addition, the lack of changes in the paired-pulse ratio of field EPSP, together with inconclusive changes in the frequency of sEPSC, implies postsynaptic actions of CX3CL1. Intriguingly, the suppression of principal cells firing was not associated with any significant changes in passive membrane properties, such as input resistance. The action potentials result from a dynamic interplay between not only the intrinsic biophysical properties of the postsynaptic neuron but also their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. As present data reported significant changes neither in passive membrane properties of pyramidal-like BLA neurons nor onto their excitatory synaptic transmission, the remaining candidate of the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduction of pyramidal-like neurons firing is the regulation by a GABAergic inhibitory system. Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the CNS is mediated by the GABAA receptor, a heteropentameric chloride permeable, GABA-gated member of ligand-gated ion channels, whereas slow inhibitory synaptic transmission is associated with GABAB receptor. Indeed, in the presence of the GABAA and GABAB receptor blockers, picrotoxin and CGP52432, CX3CL1 failed to depolarize threshold current, illustrating that those receptors were involved in this effect. However, one would expect that reduced principal cells firing is a consequence of increased inhibition onto those cells. In contrast, CX3CL1 reduced the GABAergic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA, reflected as decreased median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. Because spontaneous synaptic currents consist of a mixture of miniature (TTX insensitive) synaptic currents and those caused by presynaptic neuron firing (TTX sensitive) (Doze et al., 1991; Bellingham &amp; Berger, 1996), sIPSC frequency reflects a combination of both basal presynaptic release probability and presynaptic activity. Moreover, a change in the amplitude of IPSCs reflects alterations in postsynaptic GABAA receptors, whereas a change in the frequency of IPSCs implicates an altered probability of GABA release and/or changes in the number of active synapses (De Koninck &amp; Mody, 1994; Otis et al., 1994). Thus, a reduction in median frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs after CX3CL1 treatment, which was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggests a CX3CL1-mediated inhibition of interneuronal spontaneous spiking and/or a decreased reactivity or number of GABAA postsynaptic receptors. Nevertheless, these results provide direct evidence that CX3CL1 downregulated GABAergic transmission within the BLA, probably by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. These data are consistent with findings in other brain regions such the dorsal raphe nucleus, where CX3CL1 enhanced postsynaptic GABAA receptor number or sensitivity on serotonergic neurons (Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009). Similar action was reported in another electrophysiological study using human tissue from epileptic patients. The epileptic tissue is characterized by more pronounced desensitization of GABAA receptors than healthy tissue, manifested as a decrease in GABAA-mediated currents following repetitive GABA applications. However, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce this rundown in pyramidal neurons from cortical slices of epileptic patients (Roseti et al., 2013), illustrating that this chemokine might stabilize GABAA receptor currents. Hence, both studies reported CX3CL1-triggered modulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, leading to increased sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to GABA inputs. Importantly, one study also documented that GABAA receptors were involved in the CX3CL1-mediated impairment of the LTP in the dentate gyrus (Sheridan et al., 2014). While CX3CL1 reduced the magnitude of LTP in the DG, this phenomenon was abolished in the presence of a GABAA blocker. All these findings, including those presented in this dissertation, highlight that the actions of the chemokine CX3CL1 may vary depending on the balance between excitation and inhibition in the neuronal network. Thus, at least in the hippocampus, the CX3CL1 neuroprotective inhibition of glutamatergic drive is thought to be present during periods of enhanced excitatory transmission and intact GABAA receptor activity (Sheridan et al., 2014). Mounting evidence illustrates that a relatively small population of GABAergic inhibitory neurons are able to tightly control the spiking of pyramidal-like neurons in the BLA, especially those forming synapses at the perisomatic region or the axon initial segment of principal cells due to their critical role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, triggered by, for example, changing the action potential threshold (Hájos (2021), Tremblay et al. (2016) and references within). The only subpopulation of interneurons presently known to innervate the axon initial segment (AIS) are the chandelier cells, also known as axo-axonal cells (AACs; Bazelot et al. (2015)). Anatomically, these cells express parvalbumin (PV). Importantly, electrophysiological data illustrate that in some AACs, action potentials can evoke a time-locked, feedback excitatory synaptic input (Szabadics et al., 2006; Woodruff et al., 2006; Spampanato et al., 2016). This feedback excitatory input is disynaptic with a latency of  4 ms and shows a dual pharmacological sensitivity to AMPA and GABAA receptor antagonists (Woodruff et al., 2006), similar to synaptic bursts during oscillations (Perumal &amp; Sah, 2021). Importantly, one elegant study conducted by Saha et al. (2016) has shown that specific reduction of a pool of GABAergic synapses innervating the AIS of BLA projection neurons resulted in similar effects observed after acute CX3CL1 application. Specifically, elimination of GABAergic inputs in the AIS led to a reduction in GABAergic transmission, decreased firing rate of principal cells, as well as impaired LTP. What is more, the decreased excitability of principal cells was associated with increased threshold potential, while the input resistance was unaltered (Zonta et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2016). In line with this notion, chandelier cells were reported to regulate action potential generation at the AIS of projection neurons through their GABAergic inputs, through changing the action potential threshold (Somogyi et al., 1982; Douglas &amp; Martin, 1990; Veres et al., 2014; Wefelmeyer et al., 2015). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 likely impaired the signaling of this PV-positive specific subtype of interneurons onto BLA projection neurons, leading to the observed increased threshold current. In support of this supposition, microglia, the main cell type expressing CX3CR1 receptors in the CNS, were reported to displace the inhibitory synapses at AIS in the cortex (Chen et al., 2014). At the network level, while impaired LTP in the external capsuleBLA pathway after CX3CL1 application in the BLA is consistent with CX3CL1-induced reduction in principal cells excitability, its relation to suppressed GABAergic inhibition appears counterintuitive at first sight. However, mounting evidence indicates that different BLA projections target specific subpopulations of interneurons (McDonald et al., 2011; Unal et al., 2014), thus enabling input-specific modulation of BLA inhibitory networks, which in turn may affect the induction of LTP in this structure. Similar to the cellular level, the chandelier PV-expressing interneuronal subpopulation is a good candidate for observed CX3CL1-mediated actions in the BLA. For instance, it may be related to previous studies suggesting rather excitatory network effects of chandelier interneurons onto pyramidal-like cells in the BLA (Woodruff et al., 2010). Following this idea, CX3CL1 could inhibit those cells, leading to an observed reduction in the BLA network. In line with this hypothesis, TNF and IL-1, other immune proteins displaying neuromodulatory activity, downstream molecules of CX3CL1 actions in the hippocampus (Rogers et al., 2011), were demonstrated to affect specifically PV-expressing neurons in the striatum (Rossi et al., 2011). It led to disturbance of network homeostasis manifested as a reduction in GABAergic transmission and abnormal neuronal firing. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1, probably acting via TNF- and/or IL-1-dependent mechanisms, might regulate the activity of PV-expressing interneurons, and thus affecting the excitability of PCs. Moreover, the external capsule contains mainly cortical fibers (Mahanty &amp; Sah, 1999). Besides targeting principal cells, monosynaptic connections from the cortex recruit local interneurons via feed-forward circuits (Hübner et al., 2014; Bazelot et al., 2015). In addition, chandelier cells were shown to form reciprocal connections with PCs, and thereby they could also be part of local feedback circuits (Veres et al., 2014). Accordingly, both types of network mechanisms might be involved when stimulating the external capsule. Of note, during fear conditioning, conditioned stimuli (CS) were reported to activate PV-expressing interneurons, which in turn inhibited SOM-positive interneurons, resulting in a disinhibition of PCs dendrites and the subsequent facilitation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity (Wolff et al., 2014). Hence, considering the hypothesis that CX3CL1 specifically acts on chandelier cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition of the activity of PV subpopulation in the BLA could prevent this disinhibition, leading to the observed impaired long-term potentiation. Brain homeostasis is possible due to maintaining a finely tuned balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neuronal networks. Consistently, disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the BLA causes a disturbance of the E/I balance and has been implicated in many neurobiological diseases, such as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or epilepsy (for a comprehensive review: Prager et al. (2016)). It can occur via a loss of local GABAergic interneurons, an alteration in GABAAreceptor activation, which leads to a dysregulation of mechanisms that modulate BLA GABAergic inhibition. Hence, the GABAergic inhibitory system is the main target of therapeutic treatments to reduce anxiety or seizures and maintain homeostasis. For example, benzodiazepines, which allosterically enhance postsynaptic actions of GABAA receptors, are an early treatment for anxiety and seizure disorders (Farb &amp; Ratner, 2014). Noting that various GABAergic neuron types of the amygdala cooperate to control principal cell firing during fear-related and other behaviors, a better understanding of their specialized roles is of high importance. The previously reported the CX3CL1 modulation of GABAA receptors in epileptic tissue (Yeo et al., 2011; Roseti et al., 2013), together with increasing evidence of its regulation of E/I circuits balance (Sheridan et al. (2014), and this study), strongly suggest this molecule as a potential candidate for altering neuronal network excitability in epilepsy. A more complete understanding of the amygdalas intrinsic E/I circuit balance and how imbalances in the inhibitory control contribute to excessive BLA excitability might guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatric diseases. 5.2 CX3CL1 in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala In the present study, the CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulation in the CeL circuit was identified. The application of CX3CL1 on brain slices containing the amygdala resulted in cell-specific changes in the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons, accompanied by affected membrane properties, while membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons were mainly unaffected in response to CX3CL1. These changes were accompanied by the modulation of GABAergic transmission by CX3CL1. As mentioned in the Introduction (see 1.2.3), the activation of SOM-positive neurons is anxiogenic, as they inhibit PKC-expressing, thereby disinhibiting CeM (Ciocchi et al., 2010). Given that Regular-Spiking neurons correspond to 60% of SOM-positive cells, the observed CX3CL1-mediated reduced excitability of RS cells could prevent CeM disinhibition. However, unlike what was observed in the BLA, the reduction of the neuronal firing of Regular-Spiking neurons was manifested not by changes in the threshold current but by a decrease in the overall number of spikes to injections of increasing depolarizing currents. Consistently, in addition to excitability, other membrane properties were altered after CX3CL1 acute treatment. Specifically, Regular-Spiking neurons were more depolarized, while their input resistance and time membrane constant were significantly reduced, suggesting the opening of ionic channels. The observed depolarization of neurons during reduced firing may seem counterintuitive at first; however, this set of changes resembles hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel (HCN) activation, a type of peculiar potassium channels mediating Ih currents (for a review: Combe &amp; Gasparini (2021); Kase &amp; Imoto (2012)). Consistent with this speculation, CeA neurons express HCN channels, especially the HCN1 subtype (Notomi &amp; Shigemoto, 2004; Chieng et al., 2006; Weera et al., 2021). Unfortunately, their role in this circuitry is largely unexplored. To the best of my knowledge, although the chemokine modulation of several types of channels was previously reported in many brain regions (Puma et al., 2001; Lax et al., 2002; Oh et al., 2002; Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005; Guyon, Rovère, et al., 2005; Ragozzino et al., 2006; Guyon et al., 2008; Guyon et al., 2009), observations from this study point to a previously unknown link between CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling and HCN channels. Ih currents impact several aspects of neural and network activity. Specifically, they can depolarize membrane potentials, generate subthreshold oscillations, and synchronize network rhythms (Dickson et al., 2000; Wahl-Schott &amp; Biel, 2009; Ferrante et al., 2017). Noting recent evidence indicating the modulation of HCN channels by other immune proteins, namely interferon  (IFN) and interferon  (IFN) in the cortex (Janach et al., 2020), further investigations are warranted to better characterize the Ih activation and inhibition in CeL circuit, especially in the context of neuroimmune regulation and neuron-glial crosstalk. In contrast to Regular-Spiking neurons, membrane properties of Late-Firing neurons were unaffected by exogenous CX3CL1. On the other hand, this chemokine reduced GABAergic synaptic transmission specifically onto those neurons, which was reflected as a decrease in both the median amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs. It should be noted that CeL neurons are densely interconnected and they form more synapses between different neuronal subtypes (RSLF) than those between the same subpopulation (RSRS and LFLF) (Hou et al., 2016). This connectivity pattern supports the presented data. It can be hypothesized that reducing the excitability of Regular-Spiking neurons would lead to the downregulated GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing cells. Hence, Regular-Spiking neurons form more dense and potent synapses onto local, different subpopulations of neurons, e.i., Late-Firing. Consistently, the CX3CL1-modulated reduction of GABAergic transmission onto Late-Firing neurons should be more prominent than onto Regular-Spiking cells. Altogether, this study illustrated that CX3CL1 led to decreased activity in both, pyramidal-like cells in the BLA as well as Regular-Spiking neurons in the CeL. However, while principal cells displayed CX3CL1-mediated elevated threshold current, in Regular-Spiking neurons the lowered gain was observed. Thus, probably different downstream events were involved. In line with this, altered membrane properties of Regular-Spiking cells were observed following CX3CL1 treatment. It might, therefore, be conceivable that these membrane changes are associated with the direct activation of CX3CR1 expressed in Regular-Spiking neurons. The possible candidate is the CX3CL1-mediated regulation of HCN channels in Regular-Spiking cells. On the contrary, in the BLA, no membrane changes were observed following the CX3CL1 application. Considering the increased threshold current in BLA PCs, the impaired LTP, and concomitant decreased frequency of sIPSCs, the CX3CL1 effects on PV subpopulation of interneurons is speculated. However, those hypotheses need to be further verified. If they are true, the modulation of CX3CL1 and/or its downstream molecules on cellular subpopulations is much more specific than traditionally thought. 5.3 Microglial action in the amygdala When discussing potential mechanisms of neuromodulatory actions of the CX3CL1, the controversy regarding the localization of its receptor, CX3CR1, should be acknowledged. While some reports confine the localization of CX3CR1 on microglia (Tarozzo et al., 2003; Cardona et al., 2006), several lines of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological evidence documented the presence of the functional CX3CR1 receptor also in hippocampal, hypothalamic, cerebral, striatal, and DRN neurons (Maciejewski-Lenoir et al., 1999; Hatori et al., 2002; Tarozzo et al., 2003; Verge et al., 2004; Limatola et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2007; Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009; Ruchaya et al., 2012, 2014; Sheridan et al., 2014; Hughes &amp; Nibbs, 2018). Here, our immunohistological data from both brain slices and cultured neurons also suggest that CX3CR1 is present on neurons in the amygdala. Notably, the data presented here do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons, and the possibility that these electrophysiological effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia cannot be ruled out. In the past decade, new research has emerged providing evidence and insight into the functions of microglia. Briefly, those cells are crucial in refining the neuronal network both under physiological and pathological conditions either directly through physical contacts with neurons, by releasing signaling molecules (Wake et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2010) or indirectly via interactions with astrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017). The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is believed to be a key component of the microglia-neuron crosstalk due to its expression pattern (Harrison et al., 1998; Nishiyori et al., 1998; Streit et al., 2005; Szepesi et al., 2018). Thus, most of these studies were done using the CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mouse line, in which the CX3CR1 receptor gene has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (Jung et al., 2000). Given that only microglial cells were identified to express GFP in these mice, all studies using this strain strengthen the notion of a microglial-specific CX3CR1 expression. Nevertheless, microglia from CX3CR1-deprived mice show decreased microglial branching and altered motility (Basilico et al., 2019). Moreover, the lack of CX3CR1 in knockout mice was shown to alter synaptic transmission (Basilico et al., 2019), plasticity (Maggi et al., 2009, 2011; Rogers et al., 2011), brain connectivity (Zhan et al., 2014), and behavior (Rogers et al., 2011; Zhan et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2018; Piirainen et al., 2021). Therefore, to identify the involvement of microglia in CX3CL1-mediated neuromodulatory effects observed in this study, a subset of slices was pre-applied with minocycline, which is commonly used to inhibit microglial activation, including in electrophysiological studies (for example: Scianni et al. (2013)). The CX3CL1-mediated downregulation of GABAergic transmission and elevated threshold current in principal cells in the BLA were not observed when minocycline was pre-applied, suggesting that microglia may be involved in this process. Interestingly, minocycline applied alone was shown to facilitate principal cells firing and affect the kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA. A similar situation was observed in CeL, where Late-Firing neurons were more excitable following minocycline incubation. Moreover, when both minocycline and CX3CL1 were present, neither the CX3CL1- nor the minocycline-mediated effects were observed, suggesting opposing actions of those molecules in the amygdala. This idea is further supported by a recent study by Yuan et al. (2020), in which they inhibited or activated microglia by infusion into CeA either minocycline or CX3CL1, respectively, and exerted opposite effects on visceral hypersensitivity. However, it should be mentioned that minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that has powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties, which has some other unrelated effects, including direct action on neurons. Thus, the findings presented in this study do not conclusively support a direct action of CX3CL1 on neurons or complete inhibition of microglial activity by minocycline. Therefore, the possibility that the observed effects happen as a consequence of CX3CL1-mediated activation of CX3CR1 solely on microglia or/and direct minocycline actions on neurons cannot be discounted. It is worth noticing that CX3CL1 was bath-applied onto BLA neurons after the minocycline-induced upregulation of glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity. Hence, CX3CL1 might eliminate this minocycline-induced enhancement of glutamatergic drive, supporting the hypothesis that CX3CL1 action depends on the initial state of the network and restoring the disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance (Bertollini et al., 2006; Sheridan et al., 2014). This idea is consistent with the observed complex actions of CX3CL1 on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA: CX3CL1 was shown to decrease the frequency of sEPSC mainly onto BLA neurons with higher frequency during baseline, especially at the concentration of 5nM. In accordance to our data, studies from other group demonstrated the TTX-sensitive modulation of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synaptic transmission by CX3CL1, supporting their actions at the network level (Heinisch &amp; Kirby, 2009). Finally, the potential role in maintaining the E/I balance, along with a TTX-sensitive modulation of synaptic transmission, was also proposed to other chemokines and cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF (Rossi et al., 2011), suggesting a similar action of immune proteins in the brain physiology. To sum up, although the underlying cellular mechanisms and the possible regulation of local neuron-glia communication in the amygdala is still largely unknown, this study has shown that both CX3CL1 and minocycline modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the basolateral and central nucleus of the amygdala. Yet, the presented findings do not exclude the CX3CL1 modulation on neurons and their action in an autocrine manner or direct minocycline action on neuronal cells. However, considering the reported abundance of CX3CR1 expression in microglial cells, along with growing recognition of microglial cells, especially microglia-neuron crosstalk, in the regulation of brain functions under physiological conditions, this scenario is unlikely. Hence, considering all these issues, the microglial contribution to the observed CX3CL1-mediated effect strongly warrants further investigation. 5.4 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect principal cells excitability, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were observed. In particular, presented results indicated that following CXCL12 nonsignificantly increased excitability of principal cells (especially at a higher concentration), modulated the excitatory synaptic transmission, and induced opposing changes in the frequency of sIPSCs depending on the chemokine concentration. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation (Yang et al., 2016). Nevertheless, it demonstrated neuronal expression of the CXCR4 receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA under physiological conditions. The authors further suggested that the latter effect might lead to the increased excitability of pyramidal-like neurons. Their hypothesis is supported by the results presented in this PhD dissertation. However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward. In particular, the study by Yang et al. (2016) revealed that the application of CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA. In contrast, results presented here showed that CXCL12(2nM) enhanced sEPSC frequency in 2 out of 12 neurons, while reducing this parameter in 5 out of 12 cells. Thus, grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs. These neuronal proportions were also similar when a higher concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied. Different experimental settings may explain this discrepancy between studies. First, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed by Yang et al. (2016) in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using slices obtained from male Wistar rats. The difference between those animals was reported in many contexts (Asan et al., 2005; Northcutt et al., 2007). Moreover, while the present study was performed on the coronal slices, transverse slices containing the amygdala were used in the study by Yang et al. (2016). Accordingly, the entorhinal, perirhinal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala are heavily interconnected and implicated in memory; most of the connections known from in vivo studies were preserved in the horizontal slices (Halbach &amp; Albrecht, 2002). Given that those connections are excitatory, it raises the possibility that the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices might be, at least in part, due to more preserved and dense connections between those crucial structures, which were absent from coronal slices. Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF, Yang et al. (2016) sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a blocker of GABAA receptors, picrotoxin. Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in Yang et al. (2016) study was distorted by the modulation of the GABAergic heterogeneous group of local interneurons. Given the well-known tight regulation of principal cell activity by local interneurons (for a review: Hájos (2021)), along with documented CXCL12 mediation of GABAergic transmission (for a review: Guyon (2014)), this explanation is possible. Nevertheless, whether blocking GABAA receptors will result in a significant CXCL12-mediated increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the BLA and/or enhancing their firing in rat coronal acute slices needs further studies. In line with this hypothesis, there is a trend in the CXCL12-triggered changes in the frequency of sIPSC, although not statistically significant. Specifically, bath administration of CXCL12 produced two distinct responses: while exogenous CXCL12 at the concentration of 2nM was shown to reduce the frequency of sIPSC, the increased number of these events were observed following treatment with a higher concentration of this chemokine (5nM). These observations are in good agreement with what happens in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA), where CXCL12 also exerts opposite effects depending on the concentration used (Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005). Specifically, CXCL12 at 0.1-1 nM decreased peak and discharge frequency of action potential evoked by current pulses, whereas at the concentration of 10nM, CXCL12 induced the opposite actions. Several putative mechanisms for these opposite effects, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed (Guyon &amp; Nahon, 2007). First, the characteristic U-shaped dose-dependent effect curve is commonly displayed in signaling molecules, including chemokines. Such a process, known as hormesis, relates to adaptive responses to compensate for disruption in homeostasis by overshooting homeostatic feedback controls (for reviews: Mattson (2008) and Rostène, Dansereau, et al. (2011)). In addition, CXCL12 was shown to be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP) present in the brain to give rise to a neurotoxic fragment. This metabolite was reported to exert its action independent of the CXCR4 receptor (Zhang et al., 2003). Accordingly, the enhancement of sIPSC frequency observed at higher concentrations of CXCL12 could be mediated by a CXCL12 metabolite produced in the acute brain slice. Given that the upregulated GABAergic transmission in the BLA is implicated in animal models of neuropsychiatric diseases, further experiments using specific MPP inhibitors should clarify this point (Guyon, Banisadr, et al., 2005). Another possibility is that different concentrations might act on different cell types. This mechanism was previously reported regarding a different chemokine, CX3CL1, in the hippocampus (Sheridan et al., 2014). Notably, considering that no CXCR4-expressing astrocytes were observed in the BLA (Yang et al., 2016), together with the known expression of CXCR4 in microglial cells (Tanabe et al., 1997), it might be conceivable that the concentration needed to activate CXCR4 on microglial might be different from neuronal cells. Moreover, in addition to CXCR4, CXCL12 is known to act through another atypical receptor, ACKR3 (Levoye et al., 2009). Recently, increasing evidence has shown the ACKR3-modulated action of CXCL12 in many brain structures (Puchert et al., 2017; Fumagalli et al., 2020; Meyrath et al., 2020). Nevertheless, to date, no ACKR3 has been detected in the amygdala (Schönemeier et al., 2008), suggesting that this explanation is unlikely. Altogether, the subtle CXCL12-modulated changes on synaptic excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission might be related to heterogenous groups of principal cells and/or interneurons and/or by using coronal slices which were mostly devoid of important hippocampal and coronal inputs. Nevertheless, this study raises the possibility that CXCL12 might modulate the local inhibitory synaptic transmission in the BLA in an opposing manner depending on the concentration used. This is similar to what was observed in other structures and supports the notion that CXCL12 might exert either a neuroprotective or neurotoxic role based on its concentration. 5.5 CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala This dissertation provides new evidence for the neuromodulatory properties of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in synaptic transmission and membrane properties in the lateral subdivision of the central complex of the amygdala. First, CXCL12 was shown to modulate the excitability of CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably without the astrocytic involvement. Moreover, the frequency of excitatory synaptic currents was increased at the higher concentration (5nM) only in the Regular-Spiking cells. Finally, the treatment with CXCL12 also led to the opposite regulation of GABAergic transmission, based on the subtype of CeL neurons, which was possibly influenced by astrocytes. CXCL12 was shown to increase the excitability of CeL neurons. While a decreased threshold current was observed in both Late-Firing and Regular-Spiking neurons, the Late-Firing neurons displayed additional decreased gain. Thus, as a response to increasing depolarizing steps, after CXCL12 application, those neurons were more excitable and needed smaller current injections but produced fewer spikes during higher injections. The CXCR4 receptor contributed to the observed effects, as the presence of AMD3100 prevented the CXCL12-mediated enhancement in CeL neuronal excitability. Interestingly, AMD3100 alone was shown an opposite trend, suggesting tonic activity of CXCR4 in the CeL neurons. This phenomenon was previously reported in granule neurons precursors in the DG by using pharmacological, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological approaches (Stumm et al., 2002, 2003; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008; Kolodziej et al., 2008). The own effects of AMD3100 when applied alone were also observed in MCH neurons in the LHA (Eggermann et al., 2003), where the CXCR4 was suggested to be tonically inhibited, resulting in the hyperpolarized membrane potential under basal conditions (Eggermann et al., 2003). Moreover, the pre-incubation slices with an astrocytic toxin, fluorocitrate, did not abolish the CXCL12-triggered increase in neuronal excitability, suggesting that astrocytes did not mediate this effect. This raises the possibility that similar to the BLA and the SN (Guyon et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2016), astrocytes in the CeA might also lack the CXCR4 receptors. However, further studies employing immunostaining methods are necessary to verify this hypothesis. Regarding excitatory synaptic transmission, a complex trend was observed. At 2nM, CXCL12 was shown to reduce the frequency of sEPSC onto more than 50% of Regular-Spiking neurons, whereas the elevated frequency of sEPSC was observed during 5nM CXCL12 treatment. Moreover, this effect was prominent in Regular-Spiking neurons, while no relevant differences in the excitatory synaptic transmission were observed onto Late-Firing cells. This is in line with a study showing that PVT neurons preferentially innervated SOM-positive neurons in CeL (Penzo et al., 2015), which is in good agreement with the observed enhancement of excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons. Since the higher concentration of CXCL12 showed a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells in the BLA, it is tempting to speculate that their elevated activity is reflected by upregulated excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons. Although BLA direct glutamatergic projections to CeL have been well-established (Krettek &amp; Price, 1978; Pitkänen et al., 1997; Ciocchi et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013), differences in the type of their target neurons remain unclear. However, given the anxiolytic effect of optogenetic stimulation of the BLACeL pathway (Tye et al., 2011), the cell type-specific differences have been speculated (Fadok et al., 2018). Of note, principal cells were reported to preferentially innervate Late-Firing neurons in the baseline condition, whereas following fear-conditioning, this pattern changes (Li et al., 2013). Given that intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 impaired the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear response (Shi et al., 2016), we speculate that CXCL12 might be involved in this process. Since CeL neurons are highly interconnected, one could speculate that the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission onto Regular-Spiking cells and elevated excitability would lead to more increased GABAergic transmission within CeL. In contrast, at the concentration of 5nM, the median frequency of sIPSCs is increased in the Regular-Spiking cells, whereas Late-Firing cells were shown to display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. All of these effects were mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in the presence of AMD3100. In addition, these observations were also absent in the presence of TTX and an astrocytic toxin. A similar dual effect on GABAergic transmission in the CeL was described for another immune protein, IL-1 (Bajo et al., 2015). These observations suggest that the CXCL12-mediated actions on GABAergic transmission are multifaceted, which might be a common characteristic among immune proteins. The elimination of these effects in the presence of astrocytic toxin or TTX strongly suggests that they are modulated by both the GABAergic and astrocytic networks. The mechanisms of astrocytic modulation of the CeL microcircuit have recently attracted much attention (Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2021; Wahis et al., 2021). It would, then, be interesting to test whether the CXCL12 application led to opposing effects in those two subpopulations in the CeL by using dual patch-clamp experiments. It is especially of high importance as the impairment of fear acquisition and extinction induced by intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 was reported to be eliminated in the presence of GABAA and GABAB receptors (Shi et al., 2016), highlighting the link between GABAergic system and CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in mediating fear-conditioning. 5.6 Limitations A few limitations in the presented study should be acknowledged. The presented results reveal that both chemokines mainly modulated the amygdalas neuronal firing and/or GABAergic transmission. It should be noted that during whole-cell patch-clamp recording, the cytoplasm of recorded neurons is dialyzing with an intrapipette solution. Thus, it might affect intracellular signaling machinery, and thereby, affect cellular excitability. A gramicidin perforated patch technique would be a better option to avoid this issue, as it maintains a relatively intact intracellular milieu (Akaike &amp; Harata, 1994; Akaike, 1996). Nevertheless, this should not affect presented results, as the reported effects are eliminated in the pre-incubation with blockers of receptors, suggesting that they are specific. Another issue is that the lack of prominent effects on excitatory synaptic transmission by chosen chemokines despite observed tendencies might be related to the use of coronal slices instead of horizontal sections. Thus, the hippocampal and cortex connections, which are essential inputs to the amygdala, are absent in the coronal slices used in this study. Finally, although widely used, the pharmacological inhibition of either microglia or astrocytes might not be highly specific. Further dissection of local communication between astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the context of chemokines modulation will require carefully designed experiments with multiple points of selective interventions. The optogenetic technique allows for precise temporal (e.g., milliseconds) and spatial (e.g., specific cell types) light activation, thereby modulating cellular excitability, highlighting specificity and bidirectionally. "],["conclusions.html", "6 Conclusions", " 6 Conclusions In the present work, the effects of two structurally different chemokines, CX3CL1 and CXCL12, on electrophysiological properties as well as synaptic transsmision in the amygdala were investigated, mainly by employing a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Both of these chemokines are essential during neurodevelopment, and they have been emerging as key players in neuron-glial interactions and neuromodulation during adulthood (Réaux-Le Goazigo et al., 2013; Trettel et al., 2020). Moreover, some studies have implicated them as mediators of many neurobiological diseases, including anxiety and epilepsy (Yang et al., 2016; Schubert et al., 2018). Increased anxiety and seizures are considered manifestations of amygdalas malfunctioning. For example, several lines of evidence illustrate that BLA hyperexcitability manifests behaviorally as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, or development of seizure activity. Findings presented in this PhD dissertation illustrate that both CX3CL1 and CXCL12 modulate the activity of the amygdala network; however, in an opposite manner. The main findings of the study regarding CX3CL1 in the BLA are as follows: the CX3CL1 application decreased excitability and impaired LTP at the concentration of 5nM and GABAergic synaptic transmission was downregulated following CX3CL1 application. Based on these observations and previous literature regarding similar mechanisms in the BLA (Zonta et al., 2011; Veres et al., 2014; Wefelmeyer et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2016), we speculate that CX3CL1 acts on PV-expressing subpopulation of BLA interneurons. These interneurons target the AIS of principal cells, and decreased GABAergic activity in this area was shown to change the threshold current needed for eliciting an action potential. At the network level, PV-containing interneurons are also implicated in the attenuation of the LTP (Wolff et al., 2014; Saha et al., 2016). Moreover, reduction of GABAergic synaptic activity in AIS was shown to be mediated by microglia in the cortex (Chen et al., 2014). Thus, considering our findings together with the well-documented abundance of the CX3CR1 receptor in the microglia in the CNS, it is possible that a similar mechanism could be present in the amygdala. Similarly, CX3CL1 also displayed cell-type-specific actions in the CeL. Specifically, CX3CL1 was shown to reduce the input resistance and membrane time constant, decrease the excitability and induce depolarization in the Regular-Firing neurons but not in the Late-Firing neurons. Those electrophysiological effects are hallmarks of HCN activation. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that CX3CL1 might modulate HCN channels. In addition, the reduced firing in the Regular-Firing cells is in good agreement with decreased frequency of sIPSCs onto Late-Firing cells, as the Regular-Spiking neurons were previously reported to send more dense and potent connections onto Late-Firing cells and vice versa (Hou et al., 2016). Interestingly, the pre-treatment with minocycline, probably by inhibition of microglia (for example: Peng et al. (2016); Scianni et al. (2013); Yuan et al. (2020)), increased the firing of principal cells in the BLA and Late-Firing in the CeL. These effects were eliminated after CX3CL1 application, probably due to the neuroprotective role of CX3CL1. The deletion of CX3CR1 in microglia led to neuronal death in such models as systemic inflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsons disease (PD) (Cardona et al., 2006), implicating CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in pathophysiological augmentation of glutamatergic transmission. Moreover, the upregulation of CX3CL1 was shown to reduce neurodegeneration in an animal model of PD (Morganti et al., 2012) or AD (Finneran &amp; Nash, 2019). Thus, it is possible that the elimination of minocycline-induced facilitation of principal cells firing is also a manifestation of CX3CL1 neuroprotective actions and that this chemokine exerts anxiolytic effects in the BLA. The results concerning CXCL12 present a complex picture. In the BLA, according to Yang et al. (2016) hypothesis, there is a tendency toward the enhanced excitability of principal cells after CXCL12 application. However, the CXCL12-mediated enhancement of the excitatory transmission was not replicated here, probably due to a different slice orientation and/or the GABAergic modulation of this effect. Indeed, the exogenous CXCL12 did affect the inhibitory synaptic transmission in a subset of principal cells, although these effects were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, most neurons responded with decreased frequency of sIPSCs at the concentration of 2nM in the BLA, whereas at a higher concentration (5nM), the median frequency of sIPSCs was increased. In the CeL, obtained data showed that the exogenous CXCL12 decreased threshold, and thus increasing the excitability of both Regular-Spiking and Late-Firing neurons. However, the excitatory synaptic transmission was upregulated only onto Regular-Spiking neurons, suggesting that either BLA principal neurons or PVN neurons preferentially innervate the Regular-Spiking, SOM-expressing neurons. This is in line with a study showing that PVT neurons preferentially innervated SOM-positive neurons in CeL (Penzo et al., 2015), which is in good agreement with the observed enhancement of excitatory transmission onto Regular-Spiking neurons. Notably, based on the concentration (2nM vs. 5nM), CXCL12 produced an opposite trend towards decreased or increased frequency of excitatory synaptic events. This is consistent with our data showing elevated excitability of principal neurons at higher concentration. Intriguingly, although those cells are well-known to innervate CeL neurons, Li et al. (2013) showed that these connections are more evident onto SOM-expressing neurons during fear-conditioning. This may be linked with observations that intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 impaired the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear response (Shi et al., 2016). Therefore, the underlying mechanism of CXCL12 involvement during fear-conditioning and anxiety is of importance to be further elucidated. Findings obtained in this study illustrated that CXCL12 also affected GABAergic system. Specifically, CXCL12 was shown to increase the frequency of sIPSCs in Regular-Firing neurons and decreased the amplitude of those currents in the Late-Firing neurons. Moreover, both action potential-dependent and astrocytic mechanisms were illustrated to be involved in those effects. This is in line with the another study, where intra-amygdala infusion of CXCL12 led to impairment of fear acquisition and extinction in a GABAA and GABAB receptors-dependent manner (Shi et al., 2016). Hence, the further investigations how CXCL12 modulate fear-conditioning and anxiety is of high importance. Altogether, data presented in this PhD dissertation lay the fundamental groundwork to further investigate neuron-glia crosstalk and chemokine signaling in the amygdala. Therefore, our results together with the published literature provide support for general hypothesis that chemokines, in addition to traditional neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, represent a neuromodulatory system in the CNS. Moreover, this study also highlights the importance of using horizontal slices in electrophysiological approaches when investigating the excitatory synaptic transmission in the amygdala (Halbach &amp; Albrecht, 2002). Of note, observed opposing actions for CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CXCL12/CXCR4 illustrated that chemokine signaling in the amygdala is highly dynamic. Hence, the understanding of the peculiar pharmacological responses of chemokine receptors in different circuits and cell types of the amygdala is of particular importance, given their potential role in the etiology of emotional disorders and their corresponding usefulness as therapeutic targets to manage emotional disorders.
