<p>In concert with electrophysiological data, the alterations in dendritic morphology was observed in the primary neuronal cultures of the amygdala.<!--Moreover, accompanying the CX3CL1-mediated LTP impairment was the immature morphology of dendritic spines.-->
Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that receive most (&gt;90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014), while GABAergic terminals contact only a low proportion of them (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014, Müllner et al., 2015).<!--zmienić Dendritic spines are small dendritic protrusions that harbor most excitatory synapses in the brain. /// Spines are specialized postsynaptic elements (see also Shepherd, 1996) that receive most (>90%) excitatory glutamatergic inputs (Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Only a low percentage of spines (although particularly important, Müllner et al., 2015) is contacted by inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing axon terminals (Kubota et al., 2007; Brusco et al., 2014).-->
<!--Dendritic spines provide an enhanced connectivity, modulation of synaptic processing, strength, and plasticity by considerably increasing the computational possibilities between cells (Anderson et al., 2009; Bourne and Harris, 2009; Rochefort and Konnerth, 2012; Yuste, 2013; Dall’Oglio et al., 2015; Tønnesen and Nägerl, 2016). zmienić-->
<!--The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission, plasticity, and formation of neuronal circuits. zmienić -->
<!--Abnormalities in dendritic spine density and morphology are common pathologies in autism and schizophrenia. zmienić -->
A large body of evidence supports the critical role of dendritic spines and their morphology in neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity <span class="citation">(Hering &amp; Sheng, 2001; Kasai <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Harms &amp; Dunaevsky, 2007)</span>.<!-- citation [42–44] zmienić--><!--Morphological features of dendritic spines change in response to environmental stimuli and have an impact on the strength of synaptic connections (Araya et al., 2014; Bosch & Hayashi, 2012).--><!--The size and geometry of the spine head and neck are believed to be main determinants in synaptic signal compartmentalization, strength and specificity [1], [18].--><!--The proper generation and maturation of dendritic spines are crucial for the regulation of synaptic transmission and formation of neuronal circuits/// zmienić/// Thus, dendritic spine morphology is tightly correlated with synaptic function [@nishiyama_2019].///Therefore, it is plausible that long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two major forms of synaptic plasticity, are correlated with the spine enlargement and shrinkage, respectively [@nishiyama_2019]. -->
Hence, observed changes in dendritic spine morphology further indicate a significant impact of CX3CL1 acute application on BLA physiology.<!--jakoś inaczej to napisać we wstępie na początku...-->
Indeed, spines with large, prominent heads and short necks are generally thought to be stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and form stronger synaptic connections than thin spines <span class="citation">(Harris <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Kasai <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Ganeshina <em>et al.</em>, 2004)</span>.<!--Mushroom spines with a large, prominent head and short neck are generally thought to form stronger synapses than thin spines. zmienić // Spines with large heads are stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and contribute to strong synaptic connections. // Indeed, thin spines are motile, transient, and form weak or silent synapses, whereas spines with large heads (i.e. mushroom and stubby) are more stable and form strong synapses with larger postsynaptic densities, more AMPA-type glutamate receptor content, and larger presynaptic contacts [30,44,45].-->
By contrast, spines with small heads and filopodial protrusions were reported to be motile and unstable, and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections.<!--zmienić Stubby spines and filopodial protrusions are considered immature spines that dominate during development, and their percentage in the adult brain is considerably small.// By contrast, spines with small heads are motile and unstable and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections.--><!--Therefore, it is plausible that long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two major forms of synaptic plasticity, are correlated with the spine enlargement and shrinkage, respectively [@nishiyama_2019].bardziej zmienić-->
This type of dendritic spine morphology dominates during development and is considered as immature.
Here, cultured primary neurons from the amygdala showed a trend toward wider dendritic heads upon CX3CL1(5nM) application.
Intriguingly, when neurons were cultured in the additional presence of AraC, which was shown to decrease the number of glial cells in culture without altering the neurons viability [], the CX3CL1(5nM) application led to decreased length and width of dendritic spines.
Notably, no difference between these parameters was observed between control and AraC-supplemented medium, illustrating that AraC treatment did not affect dendritic morphology.
Thus, it is possible that these unexpected findings might reflect the CX3CL1-mediated neuron-glial cross-talk.
We hypothesize that during “normal” condition, the CX3CL1 treatment activated CX3CR1 receptors on both, amygdalar neurons and the remaining glial fraction (5%), leading to observed CX3CL1-modulated wider dendritic spines.<!-- This is consistent with .... -->
Our immunostaining data showed that the CX3CR1 receptor was expressed on both neurons and astrocytes, further supporting this hypothesis.
Given that glia, especially microglia, are crucial players in the dendritic maturation<!--citations-->, together with microglial abundance of CX3CR1 expression<!-- -->, it is plausible that this trend could be more prominent when glial component is higher.</p>
<p>Moreover, under conditions of more decreased number of surrounding glial cells, the CX3CL1-mediated neuron-glial communication is more limited and the activation of CX3CR1 on glial cells further reduced and under those conditions CX3CL1-mediated effects led to observed shorter and thinner dendritic spines.
In support of this supposition, <span class="citation">Basilico <em>et al.</em> (2019)</span> found that CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> transgenic mice displayed a higher number of silent synapses in the hippocampus in comparison to their wild-type littermates.

Although dendritic spines imaging and electrophysiological experiments were performed in two different systems (neuronal cultures vs. acute slices, respectively), the concordance of the data strongly suggests that similar mechanisms were operated by CX3CL1 in both systems.<!-- analogous to CX3CL1 dendritic spines and electrophysiology -->

Finally, in comparison to other reasonably well-understood brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, the amygdaloid nuclei do not show a rigid organization of its neuronal elements. Cells are not organized into layers nor do they have the striking preferred orientation of their major output neurons as described in these other brain regions. Thus it is not surprising that input-output mechanisms in the LA are regulated by the various ionic conductances in the membranes of their major output neurons rather than through mechanisms that rely on architectonics and differences in cell morphology.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the basolateral amygdala</h2>
<p>Herein, although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pair did not significantly affect principal cells’ excitability, excitatory, or inhibitory synaptic transmission, some interesting tendencies were noted.
In particular, results presented here indicated that following CXCL12 treatment: (i) there was a trend toward increased excitability of principal cells (especially at higher concentration), (ii) there was a complex pattern of neuronal responses manifested as frequency of sEPSC, and (iii) there were opposing trends of CXCL12-mediated regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission depending on the chemokine concentration.
<!-- The lack of prominent effects in the BLA is in line with a previous report demonstrating absence of CXCR4 in this nucleus of the amygdala [@banisadr_2002a], at least considering sensitivity and the detection level needed for *in situ* hybridization 20 years ago. nienajlepsze zdanie--></p>
<p>CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was previously studied in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in the context of neuroinflammation <span class="citation">(Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>.
Nevertheless, this report demonstrated neuronal expression of CXCR4 receptor as well as the CXCL12-induced CXCR4-dependent enhancement in the excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA.
The authors further suggested that the latter effect might result in the increased excitability of pyramidal-like neurons.<!-- However, these results are in contrast with studies conducted by , revealing that CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.-->
Their hypothesis is supported by results presented in this PhD dissertation.
However, the results regarding excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA have been less straightforward.
In particular, the study by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> revealed that the application of CXCL12 at the dose of 2nM enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the BLA.
In contrast, results presented here showed that CXCL12(2nM) led to the enhancement of sEPSC frequency in 2 out of 12 neurons, while reducing this parameter in 5 out of 12 cells (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and b1).
Thus, grouped data showed no statistically significant change in the frequency of sEPSCs.
These neuronal proportions were also similar when higher concentration of exogenous CXCL12, i.e., 5nM, was applied (Fig.<a href="results.html#fig:CXCL12BLAsEPSCfreq">4.12</a>a and b2).
This discrepancy between studies may be explained by different experimental settings.
Firstly, the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments performed by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> in C57BL/6 male mice, whereas this study was performed using slices obtained from male Wistar rats.
The difference between those animals were reported in many contexts.<!-- lepiej napisać-->
Moreover, while in the present studies the coronal slices were used, transverse slices containing the amygdala were reported to be used in the study by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>.
Accordingly, the terminals from hippocampus and cortex, two sources of excitatory inputs into the BLA, are more intact in transverse slices.<!-- potwierdzenie-->
This raises the possibility that the observed CXCL12-induced enhancement in transverse slices may be, at least in part, due to additional hippocampal and/or cortical inputs, which are absent in coronal slices.
The temperature, which is the critical factor for recording the synaptic transmission, also differs between these two studies.
Here, brain slices were submerged with the ACSF at the temperature of 31–33°C, whereas the excitatory synaptic transmission in experiments by <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> was recorded at room temperature.<!--potwierdzenie-->
Finally, while present experiments were performed using normal ACSF, <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> sEPSC recordings were made in the presence of a blocker of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, picrotoxin.
Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that the enhancement in excitatory synaptic transmission onto principal cells in the BLA seen in <span class="citation">Yang <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span> study, here was distorted by the modulation of GABAergic heterogeneous group of local interneurons.
Given the well-known tight regulation of principal cell’s activity by local interneurons<!--citations-->, along with documented CXCL12 mediation of GABAergic transmission<!--citations-->, this explanation is very likely.
<!-- jeszcze coś o excitability?-->
Nevertheless, whether blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors will result in a significant increase of sEPSC frequency onto principal cells in the BLA and/or clearly in enhancement of their firing in rat coronal acute slices remains to be confirmed.</p>

Firstly, CXCL12 was shown to upregulate the excitability of CeL neurons, which was mediated by the CXCR4 receptor, but probably without astrocytic involvement.
Next, there was a cell-specific trend illustrating the opposing CXCL12-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission based on the concentration, specifically onto Regular-Spiking neurons.
Finally, the treatment with CXCL12 also led to opposite regulation of GABAergic transmission, based on the subtype of CeL neurons, which was possibly dependent on astrocytes.</p>
<div id="excitability" class="section level3" number="6.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Excitability</h3>
<p>CXCL12 was shown to increase the excitability of CeL neurons.
While Late-Firing neurons were shown to have both decreased threshold current and gain, only threshold current was decreased in the Regular-Firing neurons.
<!-- Slightly different mechanism? -->
These effects were mediated by CXCR4 receptor, as the presence of AMD3100 prevented this enhancement in CeL neuronal excitability.
Interestingly, AMD3100 alone was shown in an opposite trend.
Thus, these findings suggest tonic activity of CXCR4.
<!-- tonic activity -->
<!--However, increased excitability is documented to results either from increasing amplitude of N-type calcium channel or inducing inward rectifier (GIRK) potassium currents, the action mediated by CXC12/CXCR4 axis. zmienić, citation-->
<!--GIRK or N-type calcium channel in CeA neurons?-->

Strikingly, the outward current was no longer observed in the presence of 1 l m AMD 3100 (AMD), a potent selective antagonist of CXCR4 (Hatse et al ., 2002) ( n ¼ 3), but AMD could have acted presynaptically.

Glutamatergic terminals on DA neurones arise from the output of the subthalamic nucleus or prefrontal cortex, which are absent from our slices.
Increased calcium permeability in terminals might raise the probability of spontaneous release of glutamate or uptake of glutamate might be inhibited at the axon terminal exposed to CXCL12. However, sEPSCs recorded in 10 lM bicuculline were unaffected by CXCL12. 
It is therefore likely that CXCL12 induces glutamate release from glial cells present in the slice.
It is well established that CXCL12 mobilizes cytosolic calcium following stimulation of CXCR4 in astrocytes and microglia (Tanabe et al . 1997), and that an increased calcium concentration in these cells may cause a massive release of glutamate (Araque et al . 2001). 
Interestingly, in the SN, the CXCL12 effect was independent of CXCR4 as it was not blocked by AMD (1 lM) (Fig. 6), consistent with the lack of CXCR4 on astrocytes revealed by immunostaining. 
The mechanism of action of CXCL12 on glutamate release thus needs further investigation.--></p>
<p>Since RS and LF cells were reported to be highly interconnected between each other, than within their subpopulations<!--citation-->, these data would suggest that increased frequency of sEPSC onto RS cells, consistent with the decreased threshold current, increased their firing, and in turn, regarding their GABAergic nature, would inhibit LF neurons.
On the other hand, the observed trendily inhibition of the frequency of sEPSC is not accompanied by the reduction in their excitability and reduced inputs onto Late-Firing cells.
Nevertheless, experiments by using dual patch-clamp experiments to record whether CXCL12 acute application led to opposing effects in those two subpopulations in the CeL would be of high importance.</p>

<p>The effect of CXCL12 onto GABAergic synaptic transmission is complex.
While it increases frequency of sIPSC onto Regular-Spiking neurons, Late-Firing neurons were shown to display both reduced frequency and amplitude of sIPSC.
WHY cell specific?<!-- astrocytes are cell specific? -->
Dose?
All of these effects were mediated by CXCR4 receptor, as they were abolished in the presence of AMD3100.
The tonic activity of CXCR4 seems to not affect GABAergic transmission.
Astrocytes modulates this effect.
Maybe only neuronal CXCR4 activity is tonic.
However, it is important to note that if only astrocytes were involved in this effect, thus why it is sensitive to TTX?</p>
<!--As mentioned previously, CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 increases pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and particularly GABA release in several neuronal populations ( Guyon and Nahon, 2007 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2008 ; Qu et al., 2008 ). 
If GABA can in turn block the effects of CXCL12, this could represent a negative feedback loop for pre-synaptic chemokine release. 
Indeed, when applying CXCL12 for several minutes, a transient increase in the frequency of sIPSCs is frequently observed, followed by a reduced activity (see Figure 3 in Guyon et al., 2006 ). This reduction could be due to an antagonistic effect of GABA, although desensitization of CXCR4 itself cannot be excluded.-->

<div id="astrocytes" class="section level3" number="6.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> astrocytes</h3>
<p>Moreover, astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the expression and protein levels of glutamate transporters in the membrane and thus control glutamate spillover beyond the synapse, which may reflect a change in the kinetics in EPSCs, which translate into synaptic plasticity <span class="citation">(Murphy-Royal <em>et al.</em>, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In relation to astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission, evidence illustrated that based on frequency and duration of interneuron firing, astrocytes could tune in to release either glutamate, which enhances excitatory synaptic activity <span class="citation">(Perea <em>et al.</em>, 2016)</span>, or ATP/adenosine, which decreases excitatory synaptic strength <span class="citation">(Covelo &amp; Araque, 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent studies have begun to elucidate that connexins, the gap junction forming proteins highly expressed on astrocytes, scale synaptic transmission, and plasticity.
For instance, while Cx43, the most abundant astrocytic connexin, does not appear to regulate astrocytic membrane properties, there is increasing evidence that it forms hemichannels and regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells <em>via</em> ATP signaling <span class="citation">(Chever <em>et al.</em>, 2014)</span>.
Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that Cx43 reduced the amplitude of NMDA-mediated EPSCs in the prefrontal cortex.
This effect could be rescued with the presence of D-serine in the extracellular medium <span class="citation">(Meunier <em>et al.</em>, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that recently ACKR3, an atypical receptor of CXC12, was suggested to internalize Cx43 <span class="citation">(Meyrath <em>et al.</em>, 2020)</span>.
Therefore it is tempting to speculate that ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex would lead to dysfunction in synaptic transmission and, in turn, functional consequences on learning and memory.
However, to our knowledge, there are no data that would confirm this hypothesis. <!-- Recent findings cast a new light on the role of astrocytic gap junction networks in neuroendocrine functions [@clasadonte_2017]. In particular, mice with deletion of Cx43 in astrocytes displayed much less excitable orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) due to dysfunction in glucose and lactate trafficking, leading to behavioral dysfunctions manifested as impaired sleep-wake cycle [@clasadonte_2017]. Thus, again, keeping in mind ACKR3-induced Cx43 internalization, it is intriguing to hypothesize that activation of this receptor could exert similar actions.

In this study, we found that intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced anxiety-like behaviors in adult mice as measured by elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and open field test (OFT). 
Astrocytes were responsible for CXCL12 induction upon LPS challenge in hippocampus and amygdala, and microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala induced mice anxiety-like behaviors. AMD3100,

AMD3100, which is an antagonist for CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, prevented the anxiety behaviors induced by microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala as well as injection i.p of LPS. Knockdown of CXCR4 expression in neurons using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) significantly blocked anxiety behaviors mediated by CXCL12 i.c injection.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the neurons of basolateral amygdala (BLA) revealed that CXCL12 enhanced glutamatergic transmission by increasing sEPSC frequency in the amygdala. AMD3100 inhibited the excitatory glutamatergic neural transmission and involved in the development of anxiety through CXCR4. These findings provide direct evidence that alterations of CXCL12 in BLA play critical roles in the development of anxiety induced by systemic inflammation and that CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-induced anxiety.

In this study, we demonstrated that LPS induced mice anxiety behaviors which was mediated through CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction, and this effect was further confirmed using the antagonist AMD3100 and shRNA for CXCR4. Perfusion brain slice containing amygdala with CXCL12 led to a pronounced induction in the sEPSC frequency which resulted in the hyperexcitability of the neurons in amygdala.
