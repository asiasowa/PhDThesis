W celu dokładnej oceny położenia grzbietowego jądra szwu, podczas krojenia korzystano z atlasu stereotaktycznego mózgu szczura (Rys. 11; Paxinos i Watson, 2007).
Do rejestracji wybierano neurony, zlokalizowane w linii środkowej obszaru DRD (Rys. 12).

Elektrodę rejestrującą stanowiła mikropipeta szklana napełniona sztucznym roztworem wewnątrzkomórkowym o składzie (mM): glukonian potasu (130), NaCl (5), CaCl2 (0,3), MgCl2 (2), HEPES (10), Na2–ATP (5), Na–GTP (0,4) i EGTA (1); osmolarności 280 mOsm i pH 7,2. Pipety ze szkła borokrzemowego (1,5 OD x 0,86 x 150L mm, Harvard Apparatus), o średnicy końca 2–3 μm i oporności 5–8 MΩ wyciągano na wyciągarce do kapilar (Sutter Instrument P–97). Wewnątrz szklanej mikropipety znajdował się drut srebrny, pokryty AgCl2 (elektroda chlorosrebrowa), połączony z przedwzmacniaczem (CV–7B, Axon Instruments), wzmacniaczem (SEC 05LX, NPI) i przetwornikiem analogowo–cyfrowym (Digidata 1440A, Axon Instruments) oraz komputerem PC z oprogramowaniem Clampex 10 (Molecular Devices). Sygnał rejestrowano z wykorzystaniem filtra dolnoprzepustowego 2 kHz, a następnie próbkowano z częstotliwością 20 kHz. Mikropipeta szklana z elektrodą montowana była na mikromanipulatorze piezoelektrycznym (Burleigh PCS-6000, EXFO) pod kątem 45°. Uchwyt, w którym mocowano pipetę, połączony był z wężykiem umożliwiającym aplikację dodatniego oraz ujemnego ciśnienia. 

Interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area were identified based on their location, shape and firing properties. The

The calculated liquid junction potential using this solution was 12 mV, and this value was subtracted from the data.

Recordings were obtained by lowering the patch electrode onto the surface of visually identified neurons in lamina I or II. Neurons with a healthy appearance presented a smooth surface, and the cell body and parts of the dendrites could be clearly seen.

The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. Only recordings with access resistance between 7 and 20 MV (average 1491MV, mean9S.E.M.) were considered acceptable for analysis of IPSCs. Data

Chlorided silver wires were inserted in each micropipette and attached to a connector. A third silver wire screwed onto the skull and attached to the con- nector served as a reference electrode. 

Electrode holders and silver wire (e.g.,

Recordings (data acquisition) are performed based on experimental design, with voltage-clamp or current-clamp mode

This technique is capable of detecting transmembrane currents under voltage-clamp configuration, or measuring membrane voltages under current-clamp configuration. Whole-cell recordings include several techniques, such as visualization of neurons in slices under infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscope, obtaining a tight seal between the recording electrode and cell membrane, accessing to the inside of the cell, and measuring ionic currents or membrane voltages based on experimental design.

The laser power and emission filters were adjusted for both the red and green fluorophor so that there was negligible possibility of false positive result. This

Electrical signals were acquired through an Axon instruments CV-7B headstage, connected to the pipette solution by a chlorided silver wire, and a Multiclamp 700B amplifier. Each primary output was connected to a Humbug to reduce 50Hz background noise. Signals were filtered at 3–6 kHz, digitized and sampled through an analogue-to-digital converter, either an Axon CNS 1440A, or National Instruments BNC 2090, at 10 KHz. Software

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out using a MultiClamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular Devices). Gigaseals (>1 GO) were obtained before rupture ofthe patch, pipette capacitance was com- pensated before breaking in and the bridge was balanced using the auto-adjust button. Series resistance was 20 MO or less during recording. Current clamp recordings were low-pass Bes- sel-filtered at 10 kHz; data were digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1440A analog-to-digital converter and acquired using pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). Data were stored on a computer disk and analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices) software. Volt- ages were not corrected for the liquid-junction potential (estimated as ~14 mV).

Chlorided silver wires were inserted in each micropipette and attached to a headstage (CV–7B, Axon Instruments), an amplifier (SEC 05LX, NPI) and an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1440A; Axon, Molecular Devices, USA).


Neurons were approached under visual control by differential interference contrast (Axioskop FS, Achroplan 40/w; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) infrared videomicroscopy (S/W cam- era CF8/1, Kappa, Gleichen, Germany). Recordings


Cells were approached with a slight positive pressure (2– 3cm H2O) and offset potentials were corrected. The liquid junction potential was )14 mV. The pipette was lowered to the vicinity of the membrane keeping a positive pressure. After forming a high-resistance seal (2–10 GW) by applying negative pressure, a second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the membrane. While entering the whole-cell mode, a repetitive test pulse of 10 mV was delivered in a passive potential range (approx. )60 to )70 mV). The whole-cell capacitance and electrode resistance were neutralized and compensa- ted (50–80%) using the test pulse. Data acquisition was then initiated. Series and input resistance were monitored repeatedly by checking the response to small pulses in a passive potential range. The series resistance was not compensated and the maximal voltage error due to this resistance was calculated to be 6 mV. The access resistance of these cells ranged from 20 to 40 MW whereas the cell capacitance was typically between 6 and 18 pF.

Live dorsal horn neurons in the spinal laminae I and II region were visualized using an infrared Nomarski microscope system and approached using a three-dimensional motorized manipulator, and whole-cell configurations were established by applying moderate negative pressure after electrode contact (Nakatsuka et al., 2003). A seal resistance of at least 2 G⍀ and an access resistance of 20–35 M⍀ were considered acceptable (Weng et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2005).

SingleDAneurons in theVTAand substantia nigra compacta (SNc) were approached with a pipette and, after a whole-cell connection was estab- lished, cytoplasmic content of the cell was harvested by applying gentle negative pressure to the pipette.

The pipette was lowered to the vicinity of the membrane keeping a positive pressure. After forming a high-resistance seal (2–10 GW) by applying negative pressure, a second pulse of negative pressure was used to break the membrane.
After approaching the cell membrane surface, the pressure was released and, in many cases, switched to a slight negative pressure to facilitate the seal formation. The negative pressure was released after gigaseal formation (> 1 Gohm), within time periods ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes. Following a gigaseal formation (normally, 4?/8GV),

Tight seals (> 1 GΩ ) were formed between the recording pipette and cell membrane, then ruptured with negative mouth pressure. Recordings

All cells were held for ≥ 5 min, had an input resistance of ≥ 23 MΩ , an action potential height of ≥ 60 mV from threshold to peak and a resting potential of ≤ –58 mV. After break-in, cells stabilized for 1 min, during which a seal test was conducted.

After seal formation and cell membrane rupture, TANs were held in voltage- clamp mode for 1e2 min with subsequent switch to current clamp mode to assess neuronal activity. Data acquisition and stimulation were performed with a Digidata 1322A Series interface and pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz. Neuronal intrinsic excitability was assessed by measuring evoked action potentials with a range of current injections of constant increment (800 msec current square pulses with 10 pA increment). Action potential (AP) current threshold (Itrh) was defined as the current step at which at least one spike was induced. AP voltage threshold (Vtrh) was defined as the voltage at which the first-order derivative of the rising phase of the AP exceeded 10 mV/ms (Nenov et al., 2015). Maximum rise and

Recordings were made at room temperature (20–22°C) with patch electrodes (1.5mm outer diameter) fabricated from filamented, thick- wall borosilicate-glass (Sutter Instruments) pulled on a Flaming-Brown puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments) and fire polished immediately be- fore use. Pipette resistance was typically ⬃3–5 M⍀ when filled with internal solution consist- ing of (in mM): 135 KMeSO4, 5 KCl, 10 Na- phosphocreatine, 5.0 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl2, 2.0 Mg- ATP, 0.5 Na3-GTP, 5 HEPES, 0.2% w/v biocytin, pH 7.25–7.30, 300 mOsm. The

Slices were incubated at 34°C for 20 min and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 1h at room temperature (RT). After

For voltage-clamp recordings the pipette solution was (in mM) 110 CsCl, 30 K⫹
-gluconate, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 0.1 CaCl2 ,
4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP. Neurons were voltage clamped at ⫺70 mV, and input and access resistance were determined by analyzing the steady state and transient upon a 10-ms-long 3-mV pulse applied every 20 s, respectively. Access resistance amounted to ⬃4–9.5 M⍀. Cells were discarded from analysis if the access resistance changed by ⬎20% over the course of the experiment. Cell capacitance was measured in voltage-clamp mode with a brief (500 ms) 5-mV biphasic voltage step applied immediately after cell membrane rupture. The mean cell capacitance was 75.51 ⫾ 3.52 pF (n ⫽ 71), and no differences in cell capacitance were found between the different experimental groups [1-way ANOVA F(10,60) ⫽ 1.563; P ⫽ 0.1401; n ⫽ 11 different experimental conditions]. To

and analyzed off-line with the programs Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA) and Clampfit 10.0 (Molecular Devices, Ismaning, Germany). To isolate the inhib- itory currents mediated by GABAA
Rs, recordings were made in the
presence of the glutamate receptor blockers 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline- 2,3-dione (DNQX) and AP-5 and the GABAB
receptor antagonist
{[(2S)-3-[(1S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl] (phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid} (CGP55845A). Baseline was defined from a time frame of 2 min of stable recording under control conditions. Holding current (Ihold
) was deter-
mined as the current required to maintain the neuron at a holding potential of⫺70 mV in the whole cell configuration. The tonic GABA current was calculated and distinguished from IPSCs with a routine written in MATLAB (The MathWorks) in which the mean Ihold
was
obtained by a Gaussian fit to an all-points histogram from 2 min under steady-state conditions. We quantified responses as the difference in Ihold
between baseline and experimental conditions. Frequency, am-
plitude, and decay time of isolated spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) were analyzed with a detection threshold of 15 pA with Mini Analysis. All

All events were visually confirmed, and detection threshold was read- justed in case events were not detected with standard settings. All detected events were used for event frequency analysis, but superim- posed events were eliminated for amplitude and decay kinetic analysis as reported previously (Herman et al. 2013). We determined means of IPSC characteristics from baseline and experimental drug conditions containing a minimum of 60 events in a time period of 2 min under steady-state conditions. Decay kinetics was calculated with monoex- ponential curve fittings and is reported as half-width decay time (milliseconds)

After slicing, brain slices were held in a chamber stored at 31–33 °C for 30 min, followed by room temperature (21–23 °C) for at least 30 min. Slices were then placed in a chamber continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF (kept at 35.0 ± 0.1 °C) under an upright microscope. Cells

To examine the effect of adenosine A2A
receptor modulation
on neuronal excitability, BLA pyramidal neurons were injected with 600 ms hyper- and depolarizing current pulses ranging from -300 pA to 550 pA in 50-pA increments. Current injections were separated by a 15-second interstimulus interval, resulting in a 270-second trial. The number of action potentials evoked by each current injection was counted and averaged across 5 trials for the baseline condition. Adenosinergic modulators were then bath applied for 7 trials (1890 seconds), and drug effects were quantified from an average of the last 5 of these trials. Input resistance was monitored throughout recordings by calculat- ing the slope of the input/output relationship generated by the hyperpolarizing current injections. Resting membrane potential was assessed at the beginning of the recording period, following the stabilization of access resistance, and also was monitored periodically throughout the recordings. Any changes detected in resting membrane potential were offset with adjustments to the amount of injected current to maintain cells at -60 mV

Each slice was transferred to a recording chamber and

After establishing a gigaseal, the membrane underlying the pipette was ruptured by a gentle suction to obtain whole-cell recording.

To examine the sag potential, current was applied to hold the cell at –70 mV
(measured at injection onset, mean ± s.d.; iWT = 69.2 ± 1.9 mV, iCre-KO = 69.3 ± 1.7 mV), and then 1-s current injections given. Traces with a trough between –90 and –100 mV were analyzed. The amplitude of the sag was measured in Clampfit and quantified by dividing the trough deflection from baseline by the steady-state deflection from baseline.

Biocytin in the recorded cell was visualized using a streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 secondary antibody (1:200; Mo- lecular Probes) for1hat room temperature.

Following electrophysiology studies, standard immunofluorescence procedures were used to visualize the filled cell and neurotransmitter content (Beck et al., 2004). Slices were post-fixed in 4% paraformal- dehyde overnight. Sections were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton and bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Sections were then incubated in mouse anti-TPH antibody (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, immunohistochem- ical labeling was visualized using an Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) for1hat room temperature. Biocytin in the recorded cell was visualized using a streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 secondary antibody (1:200; Mo- lecular Probes) for1hat room temperature.

Series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment. If the series resistance became unstable or exceeded four times the electrode resistance, the cell was discarded. When the whole-cell configuration was obtained in a stable cell, the cell membrane potential and input resistance (calculated by the voltage response to ⫺300 pA current injections) were recorded in current-clamp mode (I⫽0 pA). Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) record-
ings were made in voltage clamp mode (Vm ⫽⫺70 mV). Signals were stored on-line using Pulse software, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. The liquid junction potential was approximately 9 mV between the pipette solution, and the ACSF and was not subtracted from the data obtained.
